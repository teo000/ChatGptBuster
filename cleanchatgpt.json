    "answer": "Basically there are many categories of \" Best Seller \" . Replace \" Best Seller \" by something like \" Oscars \" and every \" best seller \" book is basically an \" oscar - winning \" book . May not have won the \" Best film \" , but even if you won the best director or best script , you 're still an \" oscar - winning \" film . Same thing for best sellers . Also , IIRC the rankings change every week or something like that . Some you might not be best seller one week , but you may be the next week . I guess even if you do n't stay there for long , you still achieved the status . Hence , # 1 best seller .",

    "answer": "There are many different best seller lists that are published by various organizations, and the New York Times is just one of them. The New York Times best seller list is a weekly list that ranks the best-selling books in the United States based on sales data from a number of different retailers. The list is published in the New York Times newspaper and is widely considered to be one of the most influential best seller lists in the book industry. \nIt's important to note that the New York Times best seller list is not the only best seller list out there, and there are many other lists that rank the top-selling books in different categories or in different countries. So it's possible that a book could be a best seller on one list but not on another. \nAdditionally, the term \"best seller\" is often used more broadly to refer to any book that is selling well, regardless of whether it is on a specific best seller list or not. So it's possible that you may hear about a book being a \"best seller\" even if it is not specifically ranked as a number one best seller on the New York Times list or any other list.",

    "question": "If salt is so bad for cars , why do we use it on the roads ? As the title states , why do we use it ? is there no other option or what ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Salt is used on roads to help melt ice and snow and improve traction during the winter months. When it's cold outside, water can freeze on the roads and make them very slippery, which can be dangerous for cars and people. Salt helps to melt the ice and snow by lowering the freezing point of water, which means that it can help keep the roads clear and safe to travel on. \nThere are other options for melting ice and snow on roads, such as using chemicals like calcium chloride or magnesium chloride, or using mechanical methods like plows or sand. However, salt is often the most effective and affordable option for many communities, especially when it's used in combination with other methods. \nIt's important to note that while salt can be helpful for making roads safer during the winter, it can also have negative effects on the environment and on the cars themselves. Salt can cause corrosion on metal surfaces, including cars, and it can also harm plants and animals if it washes into nearby waterways. However, despite these potential downsides, many communities continue to use salt as a way to keep roads clear and safe during the winter.",

    "question": "Why do we still have SD TV channels when HD looks like SD on an old TV ? Could n't we just have the HD version of the channels & delete the SD ones ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The way it works is that old TV stations got a certain amount of bandwidth to replace their old analog TV stations . However , HD takes up more bandwidth then SD - so the stations can choose between 2 or 3 HD stations , or like 7 or 8 SD stations ( or a mix of both ) They can do a bunch of SD stations and make more money in advertizing by running 7 or 8 different reruns of old SD TV shows at a time In fact , those stations often got permanent rights to show an unlimited number of reruns of old syndicated shows in perpetuity . That means they do n't even have to pay anyone to air old eppisodes of _ Star Trek _ or _ Alf _ So basically it 's free money for them , based on being around for a long , long time and having their old rights get upgraded as new technology comes out .",

    "question": "Why do we still have SD TV channels when HD looks like SD on an old TV ? Could n't we just have the HD version of the channels & delete the SD ones ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "There are a few reasons why we still have SD (standard definition) TV channels: \n1. Some people still use older TVs that are not compatible with HD (high definition) signals. These TVs can only display SD channels, so if we only had HD channels, those people wouldn't be able to watch TV. \n2. HD channels take up more bandwidth than SD channels, so it's not possible to have as many HD channels as we have SD channels. This means that if we only had HD channels, some channels might not be available. \n3. HD channels also require more expensive equipment to produce, so some TV stations might not be able to afford to upgrade to HD. \nOverall, it's important to have both SD and HD channels so that everyone can watch TV, regardless of what kind of TV they have or how much money they have.",

    "answer": "It is generally not acceptable or ethical to advocate for or condone the assassination of any individual, regardless of their actions or beliefs. There are also practical considerations at play in this situation. \nFirst and foremost, it is important to remember that assassination is a violent and extreme act that can have serious consequences, both for the person being targeted and for those around them. It can also lead to further conflict and instability in the region. \nAdditionally, the North Korean government is known for being highly secretive and heavily guarded, making it difficult for outsiders to carry out such an action. There may also be legal and diplomatic implications for any country or individual that attempts to assassinate the leader of another sovereign state. \nIt is important to seek peaceful and diplomatic solutions to conflicts and differences, rather than resorting to violence and assassination.",

    "answer": "After the Wright Brothers made the first powered flight in 1903, people all around the world became interested in building and flying airplanes. Many people started working on designing and building airplanes, and as a result, airplane technology began to advance quickly. \nOne reason for this rapid advancement was the fact that airplanes were very useful for a number of different purposes. For example, airplanes were used for transportation, for carrying mail, for crop dusting, and for military purposes. This meant that there was a lot of demand for airplanes, which in turn encouraged more people to work on developing and improving airplane technology. \nDuring World War I, airplanes became even more important because they were used for fighting in the war. This led to even more rapid development of airplane technology as people tried to build airplanes that were faster, more maneuverable, and more durable. \nSo, in short, the reason that airplane technology was able to advance so quickly was because there was a lot of interest in airplanes and a lot of people working on developing and improving them. This was especially true during World War I, when the need for effective military airplanes was particularly pressing.",

    "answer": "Melanin ! Many of the the first known humans existed in the fertile crescent - modern day Iraq and surrounding areas , and it was just as sunny and hot as it is today . Melanin causes skin and eyes to have a darker color , and as a benefit reduced the amount of UV radiation absorbed into the skin . Eventually humans expanded into less hot and sunlit areas allowing for the survival and procreation of people who developed lighter colored eyes and skin because of the lack of need of melanin for survival .",

    "question": "Why do humans have different colored eyes ? What causes / caused people to have different colors of eyes ? Is there a point to the color of your eyes other than superstitions ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The color of your eyes is determined by the amount and type of pigments in your iris, which is the colored part of your eye, and by the way that the iris scatters light. The iris contains two types of pigment: one called melanin, which gives your skin, hair, and eyes their color, and another called lipochrome, which is a yellowish pigment. The combination of these pigments, along with the structure of the iris, determines the color of your eyes. \nThere are many different shades of eye color, ranging from dark brown to light blue, and the most common eye colors are brown, blue, and green. The color of your eyes is determined by your genes, which are the instructions that you inherit from your parents that tell your body how to grow and function. \nThere is no scientific evidence to suggest that the color of your eyes has any special meaning or significance. However, many people believe that the color of your eyes can reveal certain things about your personality or your health, but these beliefs are not supported by scientific evidence. \nIn short, the color of your eyes is simply a result of the combination of pigments and the way that light is scattered by your iris, and it has no special meaning or significance.",

Prevents me from going to school by having , for example , supposed prayer times that coincide with school hours . Thanks ! Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the freedom of religion, which means that you have the right to believe and practice whatever religion you choose. However, this freedom is not absolute and can be limited in certain circumstances to protect the rights and safety of others. \nIn the case you described, going to school is not a matter of personal belief or religious practice. It is a legal requirement for children of a certain age to attend school in order to receive an education. By not going to school, you would be breaking the law and could be charged for truancy or failing to comply with compulsory education laws. \nEven if you tried to claim that your religion prevents you from going to school, the government has the right to regulate certain activities that could interfere with the education of children or the functioning of schools. The government has a compelling interest in ensuring that children receive a proper education, and the First Amendment does not protect actions that would disrupt or interfere with this important goal. \nSo, while you have the right to freely practice your religion, you still have to follow the laws and regulations that apply to everyone else, including those related to education.",

    "answer": "It 's three fold : * Stuff is cheaper to mass produce now then it used to be , making it easy to replace something * Fixing something that 's broken is almost always not a mass - production task . It require human time and effort and unique problem solving skills depending on the issue . This has always been expensive , and is still expensive today . * Many things today are completely impossible for the average person to fix , often not due to people trying to prevent it , but because things are so complicated today , that it 's nearly impossible to be able to fix all the kinds of things you use , compared to 200 years ago when you only used a small set of tools and items which were all relatively simple .",

    "question": "What has changed that we frequently now throw away products instead of fixing them ? Is it the quality or nature of the products themselves , or more cultural in origin ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "There are a few different factors that can contribute to the trend of throwing away products instead of fixing them. One factor is the quality of the products themselves. Some products are designed in a way that makes them difficult or impossible to repair. For example, if a product is made with very cheap materials or is put together in a way that makes it hard to access the parts that need to be repaired, it may be easier or cheaper to just throw it away and buy a new one rather than try to fix it. \nAnother factor is cultural in origin. In some societies, it is more common or acceptable to throw away things that are broken or no longer wanted, rather than trying to repair them or give them to someone else who might be able to use them. This can be influenced by things like the availability of cheap, new products and the convenience of being able to just buy a new item instead of trying to fix the old one. \nFinally, in some cases, the cost of repairing a product might be more expensive than buying a new one. This can happen if the product is very old or if the parts needed to fix it are hard to find or very expensive. In these cases, it might make more sense to just buy a new product instead of trying to repair the old one.",

    "question": "magic the gathering What is it . how popular is it . who plays it . The culture behind it .. etc . etc I have been hearing more and more about it , and after last nights South Park episode I became curious what it is .. Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "EDIT , Nov 21 : By popular demand , now includes Midrange decks and Limited formats . Also , a new section on where players get their cards . Magic : The Gathering is a collectable card game . It can be played in several different formats , but in the most common , two players create decks out of the cards they own and play against each other . Generally , the cards in a deck are either lands or spells . Lands provide the energy needed to cast spells , and spells usually do one of the following : - Summon a creature that can fight for you or an artifact that you can use . ( * * Creatures * * and * * Artifacts * * ) - Create a lasting effect that affects the game as a whole or one or more cards in play . ( * * Enchantments * * ) - Create an instantaneous effect that affects one or more cards in play or an effect that lasts a single turn . ( * * Sorceries * * and * * Instants * * ) - Summon a sort of \" teammate \" that has its own abilities . ( * * Planeswalkers * * ) The primary goal is to run your opponent out of life points by attacking him with creatures or damaging him directly with spells . There are other ways to win , such as running your opponent out of cards in his deck . The gameplay is complex . The players take turns , but many types of spells can be cast on an opponent 's turn , or in response to a spell that they are trying to cast . A critical play by one player may be countered by the other , and that counter itself countered by the first . There are many thousands of cards out there , and you are not expected to know about them all . The Comprehensive Rules ( * not * including the text of cards ) are nearly two hundred pages , although a lot of that consists of old mechanics that are rarely used or highly - specified details that are rarely relevant . The learning curve is pretty steep , but a few games suffice to learn the basic rules . The complexity is more similar to Dungeons and Dragons than to most card games . A key feature of M : tG is the concept of * * color * * . There are five colors : Red , Green , White , Blue , Black . Each is \" allied \" to two others and \" opposed \" to the two others . Most spells require mana of a certain color to cast , which is produced by different types of land cards . Each color has distinct strengths and weaknesses \u2013 for example , blue has the best counterspells , but it 's not very good at simply hitting things . A given deck will usually use from one to three colors of card , although in some situations decks with four or five colors can work . In addition , it is often considered that there are three general archetypes of deck ( with a * lot * of variation within each category ) : - * * Aggro * * decks focus on dealing damage ASAP to win ASAP . They usually have cheap creatures ( \" weenies \" ) that can be used right away and \" buff\"-type spells to eke out a few more points of damage . They usually win fast or not at all , because they often ca n't stand up to the more powerful creatures and spells that are played later in the game . - * * Control * * decks focus on preventing the opponent from acting until the player is ready to win with powerful spells or abilities . They run a lot of counterspells , destruction spells , and things that make action more expensive for the opponent , along with a few creatures strong on defense and disruption . They usually win by using cheap defenses against expensive attacks until they are ready to overwhelm the opponent with their accumulated strength , and lose if they just ca n't stay ahead of the enemy 's attacks . - * * Combo * * decks rely on a few combinations of cards that can lead to a near - instant victory . There * are * infinite combos in M : tG , but they 're designed to be difficult or resource - intensive to pull off . A combo deck will usually run ( in addition to the all - important combo pieces ) \" tutor \" cards that let them search their deck , protection cards to guard the combo pieces , and just enough stall cards to prevent a quick defeat . A combo deck wins when it gets its combo in place before losing , and loses if it ca n't get the combo out in time or ca n't protect it long enough to use it . - * * Midrange * * decks are a common intermediate archetype between Aggro and Control . Midrange tries to beat down the opponent with damage from powerful creatures ( colloquially , \" fatties \" ) rather than with cheap ones ( \" weenies \" ) . These decks have to run enough control to stay alive until the big hitters come out . They win when they get the hitters out early enough to do lethal damage , and lose when they ca n't get the big guys out at all ( being out - controlled ) or when they just take too much of a beating too early ( being out - aggro'd ) . --- Many different kinds of people play M : tG. There are professional players who win large sums at tournaments , groups of friends who play casually on the weekends , and everything in between . If you 're playing competitively , it can be absurdly expensive , as you can not compromise on getting the perfect cards for your deck , but if you and your opponents are playing casually , it 's a lot cheaper . The most common formats are as follows . Two - player games are the norm for tournaments , but casual matches are often multiplayer . * * Constructed * * formats call for pre - constructed decks built from each player 's personal collection : - * * Standard * * : Decks are made of cards printed in about the last 18 months . - * * Modern * * : Decks are made of cards printed since about 2003 ( minus a ban list ) . - * * Legacy * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ) . - * * Vintage * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a * very small * ban list ) . - * * Commander * * ( or \" EDH \" ): Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ) , but limited to one of each card . One creature card is designated as your \" commander \" and is nearly always available for summoning . A popular multiplayer format . * * Limited * * formats feature decks made on the spot from a limited pool of cards : - * * Sealed * * : Each player opens several randomized booster packs and makes a deck from the contents . - * * Draft * * : A group of players open many packs and use a system to pick their cards from the contents , then build a deck from what they have . These formats cost money each time to play , because you need to buy booster packs . However , you can play them without having any of your own cards beforehand . Limited play can be a good way to pick up more cards . A relatively new casual format is * * Cube * * , in which you and your group put together a large pile of cards beforehand and use them in place of booster packs . This eliminates the recurring expense , although you need to have enough cards beforehand . There are others formats , including Conspiracy , Planechase , Pauper ( use no rare cards ) . Two - Headed Giant ( play with a partner ) , and many more . Formats that allow older cards tend to be more expensive , because the cards have been out of print for a long time . Commander is a bit cheaper than other formats that allow old cards , because you only can have one of each card ( other formats usually allow up to four of each card ) . I play Commander with my D & D group . None of us puts that much money into it , and we try to keep it more fun than competitive . Some of the players also play in local mini - tournaments on Friday nights ( \" Friday Night Magic \" ) , usually breaking about even . --- So , where does one get cards ? Most cards come from randomized booster packs with 15 cards each . Cards from a given set are designated either common , uncommon , rare , or \" mythic rare \" . You can buy booster packs for around $ 3.50 USD from retailers , or you can buy them as part of a limited tournament . There are also pre - made decks that you can buy directly from Wizards of the Coast . Each one has a theme and cards intended to work together . You wo n't win any tournaments with a pre - made deck , but it can be a good starting point . In addition , there are a couple of products intended for beginners , such as the \" Deck - builder 's toolkit \" with a semi - randomized selection of cards and a big stack of common lands . ( Common lands are dirt cheap , but it would take quite a few booster packs to get enough to build a deck . ) Most M : tG players trade cards with their friends or at events to get the specific cards they need . In addition , there is a thriving market of single cards at game stores and online . Some very , very old cards are very , very rare and expensive . A single [ Black Lotus ] ( URL_0 ) can cost many thousands of dollars . But these cards are not legal in most formats , and most players will never have seen one in person . When playing casually , your group may allow the use of \" proxy \" cards to substitute for the pricey ones . Myself , I 've only been playing for a year or so , and I do n't actually own my own cards ! ( My friends have a ton of extra decks to lend out . ) I 'm planning to build my own Commander deck soon , and I 'll be starting from a pre - made deck from Wizards and supplementing it primarily with trades with friends and singles from the internet .",

    "answer": "Prions are tiny particles that can cause serious and often fatal diseases in people and animals. They are made up of proteins, which are important building blocks in the body. Normally, proteins have a specific shape that helps them do their job. But prions are abnormal proteins that have a different shape, and they can cause other proteins around them to change shape too. When this happens, it can cause problems in the body because the proteins are not able to work properly. \nPrions are not viruses, and they do not contain any genetic material (like DNA or RNA) like viruses do. Instead, they are thought to be able to change the shape of proteins by acting as a kind of template for other proteins to copy. \nPrion diseases can be very serious and are often fatal. Some examples of prion diseases include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, also known as \"mad cow disease\") in cows. These diseases can be transmitted through contaminated food or medical equipment, but they can also occur spontaneously in some people. \nThere is currently no cure for prion diseases, and they can be difficult to diagnose. Researchers are working to better understand how prions cause disease and to find ways to prevent and treat these conditions.",

    "answer": "Depression is a medical condition that affects the way you feel. It can be caused by a combination of physical, psychological, and environmental factors. \nIn the brain, depression is thought to be caused by an imbalance of certain chemicals called neurotransmitters. These chemicals help transmit messages between nerve cells in the brain. When there is an imbalance of neurotransmitters, it can affect your mood and behavior. \nSymptoms of depression can be both physical and psychological. Physical symptoms may include changes in appetite and sleep patterns, fatigue, and body aches. Psychological symptoms may include feeling sad or hopeless, losing interest in activities you used to enjoy, and difficulty concentrating. \nIt's important to note that everyone experiences depression differently, and treatment may involve a combination of therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes. If you think you or someone you know may be experiencing depression, it's important to speak with a healthcare provider for a proper evaluation and treatment plan.",

    "question": "Why do movie companies build sets rather than film on scene ? Seems like any location will do and seems like it 's cheaper to find an existing location rather than building their own . But I 'm open to being wrong . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Most of the time , any location wo nt do . They want a specific look , so they build a set to fit that look . Or there s nothing like it nearby , and it 's cheaper than paying everyone to live somewhere else for the length of the shoot . Also , many public places simply ca n't be close off that long . If you 're filming a movie over the course of a year , you might be able to shut down an area for a few days of shooting , but if you need that space often you 're not going to be able to shut down a park or roads every few days .

    "question": "Why do movie companies build sets rather than film on scene ? Seems like any location will do and seems like it 's cheaper to find an existing location rather than building their own . But I 'm open to being wrong . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "There are a few reasons why movie companies might choose to build sets rather than film on location: \n1. Control: Building a set allows the filmmakers to have complete control over the look and feel of the environment in which they are shooting. This can be especially important if the story takes place in a fantastical or fictional world, or if the filmmakers want to create a specific mood or atmosphere. \n2. Cost: While it may seem like it would be cheaper to film on location, this is not always the case. Renting a location can be expensive, especially if the filmmakers need to use it for an extended period of time. Additionally, the filmmakers may need to pay to use certain locations, or they may have to pay to have the location altered in some way to suit their needs. \n3. Logistics: Filming on location can also be logistically challenging. The filmmakers may need to deal with crowds, noise, and other distractions, which can make it difficult to get the shots they need. Additionally, the filmmakers may not have access to all of the resources they need on location, such as electricity, water, or special equipment. \n4. Safety: Finally, building a set can be safer for the cast and crew. Filming on location can involve dealing with hazards such as traffic, unstable terrain, or inclement weather. By building a set, the filmmakers can create a controlled environment where these hazards are minimized. \nOverall, building sets can be more expensive upfront, but it can also be more cost-effective in the long run, as it allows the filmmakers to have greater control over their shooting environment and reduce the risk of delays or unexpected costs.",

    "question": "What is a \" Tor exit node \" or \" Tor node \" What is a \" Tor exit node \" or \" Tor node \" ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "I 'm going to go off the assumption that you do n't know what tor is , if you do then feel free to skip the next paragraph . The entire idea behind tor is that by bouncing your information through different relay points , each of which is secured and the data transfers between them are encrypted , thus making your communications much harder to trace back to you . If I turn on my computer and use a regular browser , lets say Firefox , my computer requests that a specific bit of information from , lets say , reddit . My request is sent from my computer , to my ISP 's servers , to the servers of the website and then takes the little bit of information , lets say a specific webpage , and then does that same process in reverse . Taking the information from the servers of the website to the ISP 's servers and then back to my computer . Tor complicates this process by , rather then doing a straight line of data from computer to ISP to site , first encrypting all the communication and then secondly bouncing that signal / request for data around before submitting the request for information . This has the effect of making you appear like your in another place and posses a different IP address then you actually do . Simply put , a Tor node is one of the small parts of the jump that obfuscates your physical location and IP address by bouncing your information . An exit node is a tor node that serves as the ' exit ' point from the tor network and sends the actual request for information from the site . Hopefully that clears this up , if you have anymore questions just ask . :)",

    "answer": "A Tor node is a computer that is part of the Tor network. The Tor network is a group of computers that work together to provide anonymity to internet users. When you use the Tor network, your internet traffic is routed through multiple Tor nodes before it reaches its final destination. \nA Tor exit node is a special type of Tor node that is the last stop for your internet traffic before it reaches its final destination. When you use the Tor network to access a website, your traffic is encrypted and routed through multiple Tor nodes before it reaches the exit node. The exit node then decrypts your traffic and sends it on to the website you are trying to access. \nThe purpose of the Tor network is to provide anonymity to internet users by routing their traffic through multiple nodes and encrypting it.

It 's just attempting to get people to pay you for their thing , preventing them from pirating it . It 's controversial because a lot of DRM implementations tend to be very inconvenient for the legit customers , whereas the people that would pirate your product will likely be able to do it anyway , and because their copy is cracked , they do n't see the downside of the restrictive DRM .

    "answer": "Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a technology that is used to protect and control access to digital content, such as music, movies, ebooks, and software. It is often used by media companies, content creators, and publishers to prevent unauthorized copying and distribution of their content. \nThere are many different ways that DRM can be implemented, but generally it works by encrypting the content and requiring users to authenticate themselves before they can access it. For example, if you want to play a song that has DRM on it, you may need to enter a special code or password in order to unlock it. \nDRM can be controversial because it can make it more difficult for people to use the content that they have purchased in the way that they want to. For example, if you buy a song from a store and it has DRM on it, you may not be able to play it on all of your devices, or you may have to jump through some hoops to get it to work. This can be frustrating for users, especially if they feel like they are paying for something that they can't fully use. \nThere are also concerns about DRM being used to track users or limit their freedom to use the content in certain ways. Some people believe that DRM is unnecessary and that it does more harm than good, while others argue that it is necessary to protect the rights of content creators and prevent piracy.",

Some dogs are more prone to barking than others, and some breeds are known for being more vocal than others. \nPeople can only scream for a short period of time because our bodies are not built to handle the strain of screaming for long periods of time. Screaming uses a lot of energy and can be very tiring, which is why people can only do it for a short period of time before they need to rest. \nDogs, on the other hand, are built differently and are able to bark for longer periods of time without getting as tired. Dogs also have different vocal cords than humans, which may make it easier for them to bark for longer periods of time without damaging their vocal cords.",

    "question": "What will happen to the United States economy as our debt increases and we continue to ignore it ? Will we eventually have to pay it off ? What if we do n't ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "It's important for countries, just like people, to manage their debts responsibly. If a country has too much debt, it can be difficult for it to borrow money in the future and investors may be less likely to lend it money. This can make it harder for the country to fund things like infrastructure, education, and healthcare. \nIf a country is not able to pay off its debts, it could default on its loans. This means that it would not be able to make the required payments to its lenders and could potentially lead to financial problems for the country. \nIt's important for countries to try to pay off their debts, but it's not always possible to do it all at once. Instead, they might make a plan to gradually pay off their debts over time. This is called a debt repayment plan. \nIn the case of the United States, the government has a lot of debt, but it also has a strong economy and is able to borrow money at low interest rates. This means that it can afford to pay back its debts over time. However, it's still important for the government to be careful about how much it borrows and to try to live within its means as much as possible.",

    "answer": "It's important to note that not all Republicans are against giving the LGBT community equality. In fact, many Republicans support equal rights for the LGBT community. However, there are some conservatives who may not support equal rights for the LGBT community for a variety of reasons. \nOne reason may be due to their religious beliefs. Some conservatives may believe that being gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender goes against their interpretation of certain religious texts, and therefore they may oppose laws that would give these groups equal rights. \nAnother reason may be due to a belief in traditional gender roles and sexual orientations. Some conservatives may believe that there are only two genders (male and female) and that people should only be attracted to members of the opposite sex. They may therefore oppose laws that would give equal rights to those who do not fit into these traditional gender roles or sexual orientations. \nIt's also possible that some conservatives may simply not understand or agree with the experiences and perspectives of the LGBT community, and therefore may not support equal rights for them. \nOverall, it's important to remember that there are many different viewpoints on this issue, and that not everyone may agree on the best way to ensure equal rights for all people, including those in the LGBT community.",

Why is it so seemingly universal and why is it so vivid relative to other physical sensations we experience in our dreams ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The sensation of falling in dreams is actually a very common experience and can be caused by a variety of factors. One reason people may experience this sensation is due to changes in their body position while they are sleeping. When you are lying down, your body is in a state of relative stillness. However, if you move or shift positions while you are sleeping, your body may perceive this movement as falling. This can trigger a reflex that causes you to feel like you are falling or to experience a sensation of vertigo. \nAnother reason people may experience the sensation of falling in their dreams is due to changes in their brain activity while they are sleeping. During the dreaming stage of sleep, known as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the brain is more active and may produce vivid and sometimes strange or surreal dreams. In some cases, the sensation of falling may be part of the dream content and may be related to the dreamer's feelings or emotions. \nFinally, the sensation of falling in dreams may be related to the way our brains process and interpret sensory information while we are asleep. During sleep, our brains are still receiving and processing sensory information from our surroundings, even though we are not consciously aware of it. This sensory information may be incorporated into our dreams and may contribute to the vividness and realism of the dream experience. \nOverall, the sensation of falling in dreams is a normal and common experience that is caused by a combination of factors related to body position, brain activity, and sensory processing during sleep.",

    "question": "Why do assassins in movies / games always hold their knives with the blade facing down and not up ? [ like this ] ( URL_0 ) Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Holding a knife with the blade facing down is generally a more stable and secure grip, especially when the knife is being used for thrusting or stabbing motions. When the blade is facing up, it is more likely to slip out of the hand or be deflected by an opponent. In addition, holding a knife with the blade facing down allows the user to have better control over the blade and to apply more force when making a strike. \nImagine that you are holding an apple in your hand and you want to cut it in half with a knife. If you hold the knife with the blade facing up, it might be more difficult to control the blade and keep it from slipping as you make the cut. On the other hand, if you hold the knife with the blade facing down, it will be easier to keep the blade steady and apply more force as you cut through the apple. \nIn movies and games, assassins and other characters who use knives may hold them with the blade facing down for these same reasons. It allows them to have better control over the weapon and to make more precise and powerful strikes.",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why a carton of beer might cost less than four wine glasses: \n1. Quantity: A carton of beer contains 24 bottles, while you are only buying four wine glasses. When you buy in larger quantities, the cost per unit (in this case, per bottle or per glass) is often lower. \n2. Materials: Wine glasses are typically made from materials like glass or crystal, which can be more expensive to produce than the materials used to make beer bottles (such as glass or aluminum). \n3. Brand: The specific brand of wine glasses and beer that you are comparing might also have an impact on the price. Some brands are known for using higher-quality materials or have a more premium image, which can result in higher prices. \n4. Production and distribution costs: The process of producing and distributing wine and beer also involves different costs. For example, the process of making wine involves fermenting grapes and aging the finished product, which can be more time-consuming and costly than the process of brewing beer. Additionally, wine is often shipped and stored at specific temperatures to preserve quality, which can also add to the overall cost. \nOverall, the price of a product is determined by a combination of factors, including the materials used, the brand, the quantity, and the costs involved in production and distribution.",

For example , there was already a Burger King restaurant in Australia , so in order to avoid violating the other restaurant 's trademark , Burger King was re - branded as Hungry Jack 's ( which it 's still called in Australia today ) . Other times the name is changed because it historical / cultural meaning of the original name is lost across borders . For example , Harry Potter and the Philospher 's Stone was renamed Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone for US audiences because the mythology / story surrounding the Philospher 's Stone is not part of popular US culture / common knowledge , so the name lost it 's meaning in the US and Sorcerer 's Stone was seen to make more sense . Lastly , brand names are sometimes changed because the name may have a different meaning in another culture which ( potentially ) has a negative or inappropriate connotation . For example , the Honda Fit was originally going to be called the Honda Fitta until it was discovered that ' Fitta ' roughly translates to ' pussy ' in many Nordic languages .

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why the same products or brands might have different names in different countries. One reason is that different countries often have different languages, and it can be easier for people to recognize and remember a brand name if it is written in their own language. For example, Crest is a brand of toothpaste that is popular in the United States, and Blend-a-Med is a brand of toothpaste that is popular in Europe. Both brands make toothpaste, but they have different names because they are marketed to people who speak different languages. \nAnother reason why products might have different names in different countries is because different countries have different regulations about what can be sold and how it can be marketed. For example, some countries have laws that require products to have certain types of labels or warning messages, or that prohibit certain types of advertising. In order to comply with these laws, companies might need to use different names for their products in different countries. \nFinally, some companies simply choose to use different names for their products in different countries in order to appeal to different markets.

    "answer": "Forensic psychologists use a variety of techniques to create criminal profiles, but they do not typically include very specific details like the make, model, and color of a suspect's car or their hobbies. Instead, they focus on analyzing the characteristics of the crime and the behavior of the perpetrator to create a profile of the person who is most likely to have committed the crime. \nTo create a criminal profile, forensic psychologists may consider factors such as the type of crime that was committed, the age and gender of the victim, and any other details about the crime scene that may be relevant. They may also review police reports and interviews with witnesses to gather additional information about the crime. \nOnce they have gathered this information, forensic psychologists use their training in psychology and criminal behavior to make educated guesses about the characteristics of the person who committed the crime. For example, they may consider whether the crime was committed in a very organized or a very disorganized manner, which can provide clues about the personality and level of intelligence of the perpetrator. \nOverall, the goal of creating a criminal profile is to help law enforcement narrow down their list of suspects and ultimately identify and catch the person who committed the crime.",

    "answer": "It's important to note that a company can still be successful and have a positive impact on the economy, even if it experiences losses in some quarters or years. There are a few reasons why a company like AMD might continue to operate despite reporting losses: \n1. The company may have a strong financial foundation: AMD may have a large cash reserve or access to credit that allows it to continue operating despite experiencing losses. \n2. The company may be investing in growth: Sometimes a company will report losses because it is investing in new products, technologies, or markets that it expects will generate profits in the future. This can be seen as a long-term investment in the company's growth and success. \n3. The company may be facing short-term challenges: A company might experience losses due to temporary issues, such as increased competition, changes in market conditions, or supply chain disruptions. These challenges can be addressed over time, and the company may return to profitability once they are resolved. \nIt's also worth noting that not all types of losses are created equal. For example, some losses may be due to one-time expenses, such as legal settlements or restructuring costs, while others may be ongoing operational expenses. This can affect how a company's losses are perceived and whether they are seen as a long-term concern or a temporary issue.",

    "question": "Pro - Union vs. Anti - Union arguments . Why is there so much controversy in America surrounding support or opposition of unions ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Unions are organizations that workers can join to advocate for better working conditions, wages, and benefits. Some people believe that unions are important because they help workers have a stronger voice in the workplace and can help improve the lives of workers. Other people believe that unions can be harmful because they can make it harder for companies to do business and can lead to higher prices for goods and services. \nThe controversy surrounding unions in America often stems from differing beliefs about the role of government and business in society. Some people believe that the government should do more to protect the rights of workers and that unions are an important way to do this. Others believe that the government should stay out of business decisions and that unions can get in the way of a company's ability to be competitive and successful. \nThere are also often differing beliefs about the role of unions in the economy. Some people believe that unions help to create a more balanced distribution of wealth and power, while others believe that unions can hurt the economy by making it harder for companies to operate and compete. \nOverall, the controversy surrounding unions in America is complex and multifaceted, and there are valid arguments on both sides.",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why we might not have high resolution color cameras on some space probes and satellites. One reason is that these devices often need to be small and lightweight in order to be launched into space. Adding a high resolution color camera would add extra weight and complexity to the design, which could make it more difficult and expensive to launch. \nAnother reason is that the cameras need to be able to withstand the harsh conditions of space, including extreme temperatures, radiation, and micrometeoroid impacts. These conditions can be tough on electronic devices, so the cameras need to be robust and reliable in order to function properly. \nFinally, it can also be expensive to design and build high resolution color cameras that are specifically designed for use in space. There are also many other scientific instruments and sensors that are needed on these probes and satellites, so there may not be enough room or resources to include a high resolution color camera. \nI hope this helps to explain why we might not have high resolution color cameras on some space probes and satellites.",

    "answer": "It is not true that glands in the breast that have produced milk cannot get cancer. Any part of the body, including the breasts, can potentially develop cancer. \nThe breast is made up of various types of cells, including glandular cells, which produce milk, and connective tissue cells. Cancer can develop in either of these types of cells, as well as in other cells in the breast. The most common type of breast cancer is ductal carcinoma, which starts in the cells lining the milk ducts. \nIt is important for all individuals to be aware of the signs and symptoms of breast cancer and to practice regular self-exams and seek medical care if they notice any changes in their breasts. It is also important to get regular mammograms and other screenings, as recommended by a healthcare provider, in order to detect breast cancer early and increase the chances of successful treatment.",

    "question": "How vulnerable are TOR users . I 'm not literally 5 , and I have a basic knowledge of computers , but I simply ca n't understand [ this ] ( URL_0 ) . How can an attacker deanonymize a victim using this procedure ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The news article you posted does n't do a great deal of explaining , but the [ published paper ] ( URL_0 ;) is quite useful . Particularly , the attack summarised through the following steps : 1 ) Client downloads a file from the server that colludes with the adversary . 2 ) While the download progresses , the server injects a repeating traffic pattern in the TCP connection it sees originating from the exit node . 3 ) After sometime the download process is stopped and the server halts the traffic shaping procedure . 4 ) The adversary obtains network statistics from flow records corresponding to the server to exit traffic and for the various clients that used the victim entry node for the duration of the attack experiment . 5 ) If the flows are not correctly aligned , equally long and evenly separated , then the adversary applies the approximation strategy to correctly align them . 6 ) The adversary thereafter computes correlation coefficient for the server to exit traffic network statistics and for all the individual clients that used the victim entry node during the attack experiment . 7 ) The victim client \u2019s statistics is expected to be most correlated to the server to exit node traffic . Thus the client , whose traffic statistics are most correlated to the exit node traffic are chosen as the victim and verified . Basically , if the NSA controlled a service you were trying to access via Tor , they could send specially shaped packets to act as a sort of label . Even though the data is encrypted and anonymised through Tor ( between the entry and exit nodes ) , if the NSA controlled a lot of routers or major Internet exchange points , they could still track the special packets from the server to the first exit - node , through the middlemen , and finally ( and imperatively ) back through the original entry node & back to your original connection . But that 's not nearly ELI5 enough so I 'll do a * really simplified * analogy which gets the idea across : * * TL;DR * * - say Tor was n't actually an Internet thing and instead was a way of anonymously sending physical mail . If the sender of the parcel was malicious ( eg , an NSA controlled honeypot site ) they could send out really heavy parcels instead of normal , small , letters . So even if the parcel gets repackaged in different boxes or wrapping paper with new labels on ( the middlemen trying to anonymise the post ) , at the end of the day , the client is still going to be receiving a really heavy ass parcel . Even though it may look different , the weight of the packet indicates it 's the same packet which the NSA sent out . Which , in and of itself is pretty useless . But if the NSA controlled most of the postmen , they can just ask them if anyone got a really heavy parcel delivered that day . If they 're lucky , one of the postmen they control remembers delivering a super heavy parcel to 23 Jump Road , Michigan , USA . And then you 're fucked . But critically this relies on two things : having control of the end server , and being able to monitor major Internet exchange points in near real - time , and we 're talking hundreds if not thousands of gigabytes per second here . Theoretically yes Tor is vulnerable but this paper does n't prove it can actually be exploited in any meaningful manner to intercept communications between two end users that want to remain anonymous .",

    "answer": "TOR, or The Onion Router, is a network that allows users to browse the internet anonymously by routing their traffic through multiple layers of servers, or \"nodes,\" before it reaches its destination. This makes it difficult for anyone to trace the traffic back to the original user. \nHowever, TOR is not completely foolproof, and there are ways that an attacker could potentially deanonymize a victim using the TOR network. One way this could happen is if the attacker is able to compromise a node in the TOR network and monitor the traffic passing through it. If the victim is using a vulnerable device or operating system, the attacker may be able to exploit a security flaw to reveal the victim's IP address or other identifying information. \nAnother way an attacker could potentially deanonymize a victim using TOR is by setting up a \"fake\" node on the TOR network and enticing the victim to connect to it. The attacker could then monitor the victim's traffic and potentially reveal their identity. \nIt's important to remember that while TOR can help protect your anonymity online, it is not a guarantee of complete anonymity. It's always a good idea to use caution and take steps to secure your device and protect your personal information when using the internet, whether you're using TOR or not.",

    "answer": "Foxtel and YouTube are two different types of services, and they operate in different ways. Foxtel is a subscription-based service, which means you pay a monthly fee to access the content they offer. This content is usually exclusive and not available for free on other platforms. In exchange for this exclusivity and the cost of producing and acquiring this content, Foxtel charges a subscription fee. \nOn the other hand, YouTube is a free platform that is supported by advertising. When you watch a YouTube video, you may see ads before, during, or after the video. These ads help YouTube generate revenue, which is used to cover the costs of hosting and streaming the videos on their platform. \nIn short, Foxtel charges a fee for access to exclusive content, while YouTube is free but displays ads to generate revenue. Both models have their pros and cons, and it's up to you to decide which one you prefer.",

    "answer": "they really did nt . But often you knew where ships were likely to be . There are only so many ports , and the bigger a ship the bigger a port it needs to be able to dock . A pirate might wait in the shipping lanes a day or two outside of a busy port and wait for a target . Or he might wait for a ship to dock and become a sitting target in an undefended port . A third choice is to cruise near nautical choke points like between islands or outside sandbars . Large convoys of vessels also usually took predictable routes , there was a range of a few degrees which offered the fastest trip to and from Europe due to trade winds and currents , and ships tried to avoid sailing in storm and hurricane season so there tended to be a good deal of activity when it was optimal for sailing . Once a ship was in sight it was then just a matter of who was the better seaman , or which ship was to windward , and in many cases some luck . Ships might be in sight but 20 miles away and still be in a chase .",

    "answer": "Before radar and sonar were invented, pirates and navies used a variety of methods to track down other ships. One common method was to use visual clues, such as looking for the sails or smoke from the ship's chimney. They might also use telescopes or other instruments to help them spot ships at a distance. \nAnother method was to use the stars and other celestial bodies as navigation aids. By looking at the position of the stars and other celestial objects, sailors could determine their own location and the direction they were heading. They could then use this information to figure out where other ships might be located. \nSailors also used maps and charts to help them navigate the oceans. These could show them the locations of land masses, reefs, and other hazards, as well as the directions of the currents and winds. By using these tools, sailors could plan their routes and figure out the best way to reach their destination. \nFinally, sailors might use their own senses, such as hearing and smell, to help them locate other ships. For example, they might be able to hear the sound of another ship's anchor being dropped or the smell of wood smoke from its chimney. \nOverall, while tracking down other ships was difficult before the invention of modern technology, sailors were still able to use a variety of tools and techniques to navigate the oceans and locate other ships.",

    "answer": "Mixing different colors of light actually does result in a different color, just like mixing paint does. The difference is in how our eyes and brains interpret the colors. \nWhen you mix two colors of paint together, the pigments in the paint absorb certain wavelengths of light and reflect others. For example, red paint reflects red light and absorbs other colors. When you mix red and green paint together, the resulting color is a brownish color because the pigments in the paint are absorbing all of the colors of light except for brown. \nOn the other hand, when you mix two colors of light together, like red and green, the resulting color is a bright yellow because the light is actually adding together. This is because light is made up of different wavelengths of energy, and when you mix two colors of light together, you are adding the wavelengths of energy together. \nSo, the reason why mixing paint results in a different color than mixing light is because paint absorbs certain wavelengths of light, while light adds different wavelengths of energy together.",

    "answer": "Monsanto is a company that produces agricultural products, including seeds and chemicals. Some people believe that Monsanto is an evil company because they have been involved in several controversial practices. \nOne reason some people view Monsanto as evil is because they have been accused of producing genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that may have negative impacts on the environment and human health. These GMOs are plants or animals that have had their DNA altered in a laboratory in order to give them certain desired traits, such as resistance to pests or the ability to grow in certain conditions. Some people are concerned that these genetically modified organisms could harm the natural environment and have unintended consequences for human health. \nAnother reason some people view Monsanto as evil is because the company has been accused of using questionable tactics to promote their products and protect their patents. For example, Monsanto has been accused of suing farmers who saved and replanted seeds from their crops, even though this is a common practice among farmers. The company has also been accused of attempting to influence the scientific research and regulatory processes related to their products. \nMonsanto is no longer a standalone company.

    "question": "why are stormclouds gray when normal clouds are white ? Should nt it just be water particles in both cases ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Storm clouds are gray because they contain a lot of water droplets that are very close together. When light from the sun or other sources passes through these droplets, it scatters in all directions. This is what makes the clouds appear white. \nHowever, storm clouds are often much denser and contain a lot more water droplets than normal clouds. This means that more light is scattered in all directions, which can make the clouds appear darker. This is why storm clouds are often gray. \nNormal clouds are white because they also contain water droplets, but these droplets are farther apart from each other. This means that less light is scattered in all directions, which makes the clouds appear white. \nOverall, the color of clouds is determined by the amount of water droplets they contain and how these droplets scatter light. Storm clouds appear gray because they contain a lot of water droplets that scatter a lot of light in all directions, while normal clouds appear white because they contain fewer water droplets that scatter less light.",

    "question": "The differences between flash and HTML5 Which one is better for me as a user ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "They are really quite different . HTML is the language that websites are written in . It describes what elements are in the page and how they 're organized ( elements such as text , images , buttons and links ) . However , HTML originally did n't include the ability to show graphics , animations or videos ( other than pre - rendered images and animated gifs ) . HTML did provide the ability to include embedded objects , which would require the user to install a plugin that could display them . One such common plugin was Flash , which was basically another small program that runs inside your browser ( another such plugin is Java which can display Java Applets , but they 're hardly in use anymore ) . So developers could use Flash to create things like games ( such as the ones you 'll find in URL_0 ) and video players ( such as YouTube ) . HTML5 introduces new features to HTML , mainly the support for the < canvas > and < video > elements . These tags could be used to display graphics and videos without the need for an external plugin , and were handled by the browser and not by the plugin . HTML5 introduces many other new features , but these are the ones that are most relevant to this discussion ( HTML5 vs Flash ) . The main advantage of HTML5 is that it 's a standard that 's supported ( or should be supported ) by every browser . On the contrary , Flash is no longer supported by Apple 's devices , and by Android 's stock browser . Another disadvantage of Flash is that it 's considered slow and inefficient .",

Flash is a software platform that was developed by Adobe and is used to create animations, games, and other interactive content. HTML5 is a version of the HTML programming language that is used to create the structure and layout of websites and web applications. \nAs a user, it's important to know that Flash and HTML5 are not directly competing technologies. They are simply two different ways of creating and displaying content on the internet, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. \nHere are some key differences between Flash and HTML5: \nCompatibility: Flash requires a separate plug-in to be installed in your web browser in order to work, while HTML5 is built into most modern browsers and does not require any additional software. This means that HTML5 content is generally more widely compatible and can be accessed on a wider range of devices, including smartphones and tablets.\nPerformance: HTML5 content tends to perform better than Flash content, especially on mobile devices. This is because HTML5 content is designed to be lightweight and efficient, while Flash content can be more resource-intensive and may not run as smoothly on some devices.\nSecurity: Flash has a reputation for being less secure than HTML5, as it is more susceptible to malware and other types of online threats. HTML5, on the other hand, has built-in security features that help to protect against these types of threats. \nUltimately, which technology is \"better\" for you as a user will depend on your specific needs and preferences. If you need to access interactive content or games on the internet, then Flash may be a good option for you. If you are primarily interested in accessing static content (such as text and images) or using web-based applications, then HTML5 may be a better choice.",

If you put the pizza in an oven that is not hot enough, it will take longer to cook and the crust may not turn out as crispy as you'd like. \nAs for the instructions to keep the pizza frozen while preheating the oven, this is probably because the pizza will cook more evenly if it goes into the oven frozen. When the pizza is frozen, the heat of the oven will thaw and cook it gradually, rather than going straight from cold to hot and potentially cooking unevenly. \nOverall, following the instructions on the pizza box (such as preheating the oven and keeping the pizza frozen) can help you achieve the best possible results when cooking your pizza.",

    "question": "Where do movies find newborn babies ? I have always thought that maybe they are just fake or some lady really let them use her newborn Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Movies and TV shows often use newborn babies as actors for scenes that require a baby to be shown on screen. These babies are usually provided by baby casting agencies, which are companies that specialize in finding and hiring babies and young children for roles in the entertainment industry. \nThe babies used in movies and TV shows are typically a few weeks or months old, and they are usually accompanied by a parent or guardian on set. The babies are carefully supervised by the production team and are only used for short periods of time to ensure their safety and well-being. \nIn some cases, filmmakers may use props or special effects to create the appearance of a newborn baby on screen, rather than using a real baby. This can be done using dolls, animatronics, or computer-generated imagery (CGI). However, it is often more realistic to use real babies when they are needed in a scene.",

    "answer": "LSD (Lysergic acid diethylamide) is a powerful hallucinogenic drug that can cause changes in a person's perception of reality, thoughts, and emotions. It is often taken in the form of small squares of paper that have been soaked in the drug. When someone takes LSD, they may experience hallucinations, which are vivid and distorted perceptions of things that are not really there. They may see, hear, and feel things that are not real. They may also have altered perceptions of time and space, and may feel disconnected from their own body. It is important to note that LSD can be very unpredictable, and the effects can vary greatly from person to person. It is also important to note that LSD is illegal in many countries, and it is not safe to use.",

    "answer": "In the United States, the phrase \"Merry Christmas\" is commonly used to wish someone a happy holiday season. In other English-speaking countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Australia, the phrase \"Happy Christmas\" is more commonly used. \nThe origins of these phrases can be traced back to the early history of the Christmas holiday. \"Merry\" is an adjective that means joyful and light-hearted, and \"happy\" is an adjective that means feeling or showing pleasure. Both words are used to describe the feelings of joy and happiness that are associated with the Christmas holiday. \nThe use of these phrases varies from country to country and is influenced by a variety of factors, including cultural and regional traditions. It is also worth noting that both phrases are used in different parts of the world, and there is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to wish someone a happy holiday season.",

    "question": "Why is NASA 's Space / launch center based in Florida ? As compared to any other state . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Florida was chosen for several major reasons . One was , it 's close to the equator . [ The linear velocity of Earth 's surface is greatest at the equator , much as a ceiling fan blade slices through the air faster at its tip than at its center hub , conferring a fuel - saving boost to spacecraft attempting to escape Earth 's gravity.\u2014Editor 's Note ] The second reason was it had to be on the east coast , over the ocean , so you would n't fly over people that might get killed as stuff dropped off or blew up . And the location that they chose in Florida had a lot to do with the fact that there was n't anything there . You go there today and you do n't see it , but Brevard County in the 1940s was a bunch of orchards and hardly anything else . And this island that they 're on [ Merritt Island ] had good logistics , because there was a navy base and an army base not too far away . But there was no population density whatsoever . It was just a beach , essentially . So you could build what you wanted , but it had decent roads because of the military , and that was important . This is one of the problems that [ the Soviet Union ] had with Baikonur [ Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan ] , their launch site . I mean , it is in the middle of nowhere . They had to build a whole infrastructure to run rail out there , to build highways , to bring in all of the water and power and everything else that was necessary to make that place habitable .

    "question": "Why is NASA 's Space / launch center based in Florida ? As compared to any other state . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "NASA, which stands for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is based in Florida for a few reasons. One reason is because Florida is close to the equator, which makes it easier to launch rockets into space. This is because the Earth's rotation is faster at the equator, which means that rockets can get a little extra \"boost\" when they launch. \nAnother reason is because Florida has a long history with space travel. The first American astronaut, Alan Shepard, launched into space from Florida in 1961. Since then, many other important space missions have launched from Florida, including the Apollo missions to the Moon and the space shuttle program. \nFinally, Florida has a lot of open space and good weather, which makes it a good place to test and launch rockets. The Kennedy Space Center, which is located on the east coast of Florida, is the main launch site for NASA and has been used for many important space missions. \nSo, in short, Florida is a good place for NASA to launch rockets because it's close to the equator, has a long history with space travel, and has a lot of open space and good weather.",

While it is true that Japan has a reputation for being a more traditional and conservative culture, it is also home to a vibrant and creative media industry. \nThe Japanese media industry is known for producing a wide variety of content, including video games, TV shows, and music, that often incorporates elements of Japanese culture and history. This can include things like traditional Japanese instruments and themes, as well as more modern and unconventional elements. \nIt's also worth noting that different parts of Japanese culture can have different levels of conservatism. For example, some aspects of Japanese culture, such as traditional family structure or gender roles, may be more conservative, while other parts of Japanese culture, such as the media industry, may be more open to experimentation and innovation. \nOverall, it's important to remember that Japan is a complex and multifaceted culture, and it's not fair to generalize or stereotype all aspects of Japanese culture based on a few specific examples.",

These cities have high costs for things like housing, food, and transportation, which can make it hard for people who don't have a lot of money to afford the things they need. \nOne way that people with minimum wage jobs can try to make ends meet is by finding ways to save money. For example, they might look for cheaper places to live, such as shared apartments or homes, or they might try to find ways to save money on food, such as by cooking at home instead of eating out. \nAnother way that people with minimum wage jobs can try to get by is by finding ways to make more money. This might involve getting a second job, finding ways to earn extra money on the side, or even starting their own business. \nIt's also important for people with minimum wage jobs to be smart about their money and to make a budget to help them stay on track. This might involve setting aside money for important expenses, like rent and bills, and cutting back on unnecessary expenses, like going out to eat or buying expensive clothes. \nOverall, it can be challenging for people with minimum wage jobs to get by in cities with high costs of living, but with careful planning and hard work, it is possible to make ends meet.",

Please explain to to me what happens to all this excess military equipment . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Hey , US Army Infantryman who is actually in Afghanistan right now here . In an Infantry platoon it is the Platoon Sergeant 's job to maintain accountability of all men , weapons , and equipment . He does this by maintaining a MAL ( master authorization list ) given to him by the Company 's Armorer when weapons are signed out from the arms room . When a Soldier is injured or killed during combat operations he / she is put onto a MEDEVAC ( medical evacuation ) vehicle , whether it be a helicopter or some form of ground transportation . Prior to the Soldier being loaded all of his equipment is stripped off of him / her and retained by the unit . If the Soldier carried a crucial casualty producing weapon , like a machine gun with a higher rate of fire than the standard M4 , it will be given to the next most qualified person along with all the ammo . This is to try and maintain the combat effectiveness , AKA how many bullets you can throw at people , despite having less people . As for the gear , after it is recovered back to a FOB ( Forward Operating Base ) all gear that was worn by a casualty is inspected by people certified to determine whether it is serviceable . If an item is not serviceable and the casualty is still alive the inspectors will make an effort to send the item to the casualty 's home . It is not uncommon for Soldiers who received gunshots to their helmets to get to keep those for life . Enemy equipment is another story . In a perfect scenario where we eliminate the threat and have time to investigate any enemy equipment is gathered by a TSE team ( Tactical Site Exploitation ) on the spot and processed similar to a crime scene . Bagged , tagged , photographed , and turned into Military Intelligence for processing so they can determine ways to fight better against the enemy 's weapons and equipment . In other situations enemy equipment is destroyed on the spot to permanently prevent the enemy from using that against us . TL;DR Platoon Sergeant is responsible for recovering friendly equipment to the best of his abilities and repaired as quickly as possible . Enemy equipment is analyzed by Military intelligence or destroyed on the spot .",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why gas prices have gone down in the past few months. \nOne reason is that there is currently a lot of oil being produced around the world. Oil is used to make gasoline, so when there is a lot of oil available, it can help to lower the price of gasoline. \nAnother reason is that people are using less gasoline due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people are staying at home and not driving as much, which means there is less demand for gasoline. When there is less demand for a product, the price of that product tends to go down. \nFinally, some countries produce and export a lot of oil, and the price of oil is often influenced by the relationships between these countries and how they trade with each other. If there is a lot of oil being produced and exported by certain countries, it can help to lower the price of gasoline. \nSo, in summary, gas prices have gone down because there is currently a lot of oil being produced, people are using less gasoline due to the pandemic, and the relationships between oil-producing countries can also affect the price.",

    "answer": "The Double Jeopardy Clause is a part of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. It states that no person shall \"be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\" This means that if someone is acquitted (found not guilty) of a crime, they cannot be tried again for the same crime. \nThe Double Jeopardy Clause is designed to protect people from being subjected to the stress and expense of multiple trials for the same crime. It also helps to prevent the government from using its power to try to punish someone over and over again until it gets the result it wants. \nHowever, there are some exceptions to the Double Jeopardy Clause. For example, if new evidence is discovered that was not available at the time of the original trial, it may be possible to bring someone to trial again for the same crime. Additionally, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not apply in cases where the crime was committed in different states or in cases where the person was tried in both a state court and a federal court.",

    "answer": "Vegetables get their vitamins and minerals from the soil and the water that they absorb through their roots. The soil contains a variety of nutrients that plants need to grow and thrive, including vitamins and minerals. When a plant absorbs water from the soil, it also takes in these nutrients along with it. The plant then uses these nutrients to produce energy through photosynthesis, which is the process of converting sunlight into energy. \nSo, in a way, vegetables \"eat\" the nutrients that are in the soil and water, and use the energy from sunlight to turn those nutrients into the vitamins and minerals that they need to survive.

Some people believe that Banksy is the pseudonym of a single person, while others believe that it may be a group of artists who work together. \nThere are a few ways that experts can tell if a piece of graffiti is by Banksy or not. One way is by looking at the style of the artwork. Banksy's art has a distinctive style that is instantly recognizable to many people, and experts can often tell if a piece of graffiti is by Banksy just by looking at it. \nAnother way to tell if a piece of graffiti is by Banksy is by looking at the location where it was created. Banksy often creates his graffiti in secret and in unexpected places, so if a piece of graffiti is found in a place where Banksy is known to have worked, it is more likely to be by him. \nFinally, experts can also use other clues to determine if a piece of graffiti is by Banksy, such as the materials and techniques that were used to create it. For example, Banksy often uses stencils to create his graffiti, so if a piece of graffiti was made using stencils, it is more likely to be by him. \nOverall, while it is not always possible to know for certain if a piece of graffiti is by Banksy or not, experts can use a combination of these methods to make an educated guess.",

Snow is made up of frozen water vapor, while rain is made up of liquid water.

Ice is a solid, while water is a liquid. If you put ice in a warm room, it will eventually melt and become water. Similarly, if the air is warm enough, snow will melt and become rain.

HTML5 and GIFs serve different purposes and are used for different types of content on the web. \nHTML5 is more efficient than GIFs in terms of data usage because it allows you to display images and other types of media directly in the HTML code, without having to use separate image files. This means that you can include images and other media on your web pages without adding extra data to your website. In contrast, GIFs are separate image files that have to be downloaded separately from the HTML code, which can increase the amount of data needed to load a web page. \nHTML5 is also faster than GIFs because it allows you to display media directly in the HTML code, rather than having to load separate image files. This can make your web pages load faster, especially on devices with slower internet connections. \nOverall, HTML5 is a more efficient and flexible way to display media on the web compared to GIFs, which is why it is more widely used today.

    "question": "why does the electric company provides incentives to purchase CFL over incandescent light bulbs ? Does nt the electric company makes money of off kW / hr ? So more usage = more revenue ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Electric companies make money by selling electricity to customers. The amount of electricity that a customer uses is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh). The electric company charges a certain amount of money for each kWh of electricity that a customer uses. \nUsing energy-efficient light bulbs, such as compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), can help a customer use less electricity because these bulbs use less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs. If a customer uses less electricity, then they will pay less money to the electric company. \nHowever, the electric company still wants customers to use electricity because it is a source of revenue for them. So, the electric company may provide incentives, such as discounts or rebates, to encourage customers to switch to energy-efficient bulbs. This can help the electric company save money on their own energy costs, as well as help the environment by reducing energy consumption. \nIn the end, both the electric company and the customer can benefit from using energy-efficient bulbs because it can lead to lower electricity bills and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.",

    "question": "What is Russia 's motivation in the Ukraine crisis ? The media seems content to paint Russia ( especially Putin ) as an aggressive villain , but there 's no way it 's that simple . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "They want a buffer state in part of the Polish Funnel , a strategically difficult to defend area where armies throughout time have marched through to invade Russia . [ Here is a map ] ( URL_0 ) of European geography . The Mountainous areas are difficult for troops to maneuver through , think of them as natural walls . So it is advisable to control and defend the land behind those walls so enemy troops ca n't slowly amass on your side of those walls . [ Russia has already lost the first line of buffer states , Poland , Czech republic , Slovakia , Hungary and Romania as their first line of countries as buffers after the Soviet Union broke up . ] ( URL_1 ) With those countries lost to NATO , an organization considers Russia as an adversary , and considered equally hostile by Russia , Russia effectively has lost most of the natural geographical defenses . Only Ukraine and Moldova sit behind those natural \" walls \" that are still not a part of NATO alliance . Moldova is however not aligned with Russia either . The last line of buffers are made up of Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Belarus , and Ukraine . However here is even more grim for Russia . Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania all have joined NATO . However , their combined borders shared with Russia are small and can be defended effectively . Ukraine therefore holds a key strategic importance to Russia since She not only holds a key defensible spot right behind the Carpathian mountains , but her borders to Russia would not only open up a second front that Russia would have to defend from Europe , but also a very large border . So therefore , Russia 's ideal goal is to keep Ukraine from joining the EU and NATO , and prevent her from receiving western military bases , troops , and assets . However , Russia might not be able to prevent the entirety of Ukraine from joining NATO , so the next best thing , or the best of the worst outcomes , is to split Ukraine up , east and west , with the eastern Ukraine being aligned with Russia and act as a small , but still precious buffer space . * * TLDR : The walls around Russia are crumbling and being replaced by potential enemies . Ukraine is a huge chunk of that wall and Russia does n't want it to fall too . * * * edit , a better map *",

    "answer": "It's important to understand that the situation in Ukraine is complex and there are many different factors at play. Russia has a long history with Ukraine, and the two countries have close cultural, economic, and political ties. \nOne factor that has contributed to the current crisis is Russia's concern about the influence of Western countries, particularly the United States, in Ukraine. Russia has historically seen Ukraine as being within its sphere of influence and has been wary of any efforts by Western countries to gain influence there. \nAnother factor is the issue of Crimea, which is a peninsula in the Black Sea that was part of Ukraine but was annexed by Russia in 2014. This annexation was not recognized by most of the international community and was met with condemnation and economic sanctions. \nOverall, it's difficult to say exactly what Russia's motivations are in the Ukraine crisis, as there are many different factors at play and it's a complex situation. It's important to try to understand the perspectives of all parties involved and to approach the situation with an open mind.",

    "answer": "The cost of sending ACT scores and transcripts may vary for a number of reasons. One reason is that the organizations that handle these services have different operating costs, such as employee salaries, technology expenses, and overhead costs like rent and utilities. Additionally, the demand for these services may also be different, which can impact the price. For example, more students may need to send transcripts to colleges and universities than ACT scores, so the cost of sending transcripts may be lower in order to make it more accessible for students. Finally, the cost of sending transcripts may also be lower because transcripts typically contain more information than a single ACT score, and it may be more expensive for the organization to process and transmit this additional information.",

    "answer": "In English, we often use gender-specific pronouns to refer to inanimate objects. This means that we might use \"she\" or \"her\" to refer to a ship or a car, even though these things are not alive and do not have a gender. This is a way of speaking that we have inherited from the way that English has evolved over time, and it is not based on any inherent qualities of the objects themselves. \nOne reason why we might use \"she\" to refer to a ship is because ships have traditionally been given feminine names, especially in naval contexts. For example, a ship might be named after a woman or a mythological figure, such as the USS Constitution (also known as \"Old Ironsides\") which was named after the United States Constitution. Because ships are often given feminine names, it has become common to refer to them using feminine pronouns. \nIt's also worth noting that different languages have different ways of referring to inanimate objects. In some languages, all nouns are either masculine or feminine, and the gender of the noun determines the gender of the pronoun used to refer to it. In English, this is not the case, and we can use any pronoun to refer to an inanimate object.",

    "answer": "If the Earth stopped spinning, it would be a very big problem! Here's why: \n1. The Earth spins on its axis, which is an imaginary line that goes through the North Pole and South Pole. This is what makes it feel like the sun is rising and setting every day. If the Earth stopped spinning, the sun would just stay in one place in the sky and it would be very hot on one side of the Earth and very cold on the other side. \n2. The Earth's spin also helps to keep the oceans moving. If the Earth stopped spinning, the oceans would all pile up on one side of the Earth, and there would be a huge wave on the other side. \n3. The Earth's spin also helps to keep the atmosphere moving. If the Earth stopped spinning, the air would all pile up on one side of the Earth and there would be very strong winds on the other side. \n4. Finally, if the Earth stopped spinning, everything on the Earth would be thrown off into space. This includes all the people, animals, and buildings on the Earth. It would be a very big mess! \nSo, in short, if the Earth stopped spinning it would be a very big problem and cause a lot of problems for everyone and everything on the Earth.",

    "question": "For someone who does n't watch NFL , why was it so bad for the Seahawks to pass the ball ? I live in Australia , please be gentle . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "In American football, the team with possession of the ball (called the offense) has four chances, or downs, to move the ball 10 yards down the field. If they are successful in moving the ball 10 yards, they earn another set of downs. If the offense fails to move the ball 10 yards, possession of the ball is turned over to the other team (called the defense). \nOne way for the offense to move the ball is by throwing it through the air (called a pass). The offense can also try to move the ball by running with it (called a rush). \nIn the situation you are describing, it was probably considered \"bad\" for the Seattle Seahawks to pass the ball because it may not have been the most effective way for them to move the ball and get closer to scoring. There could be a number of reasons why passing the ball may not have been the best choice, such as the defense anticipating the pass and intercepting the ball, or the quarterback (the player who throws the ball) not having enough time to throw the ball due to pressure from the defense. \nIt's also possible that the team had been trying to pass the ball and were not having success, and so it may have been more effective for them to try to run the ball or use a different strategy to try to move the ball down the field. Ultimately, the team's decision on whether to pass or run the ball will depend on a variety of factors, including the specific strengths and weaknesses of the offense and defense, the situation on the field, and the overall game plan.",

    "answer": "Doctors can use several different methods to find out if a person has allergies. One common method is to do a skin prick test. During this test, a small amount of an allergen (such as a substance that a person might be allergic to) is placed on the skin, and then a needle is used to prick the skin through the allergen. If the person is allergic to the allergen, they will develop a raised bump or rash on their skin. \nAnother way to test for allergies is to do a blood test. During this test, a blood sample is taken from the person and sent to a laboratory, where it is tested for the presence of antibodies to specific allergens. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body's immune system in response to an allergen. If the person has allergies, their blood will contain high levels of these antibodies. \nIt's important to note that doctors do not usually test for allergies by exposing a person to the allergen directly. This is because allergies can cause serious reactions, such as difficulty breathing or a drop in blood pressure, and it would be dangerous to intentionally trigger these reactions. Instead, doctors use safer methods, such as skin prick tests and blood tests, to test for allergies.",

    "answer": "Cancer is not the most common disease associated with DNA mutations. In fact, most DNA mutations do not cause any significant problems or diseases. However, some DNA mutations can cause problems with the way cells function, and can lead to the development of cancer. \nCancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow and divide in an uncontrolled way. Normal cells in the body follow a specific pattern of growth and division, but cancer cells do not. They continue to grow and divide even when the body does not need them, and they do not die when they should. This can lead to the formation of tumors, which can be harmful if they grow in certain parts of the body or if they spread to other parts of the body. \nThere are many different factors that can increase the risk of developing cancer, including genetics, environmental factors, and lifestyle factors. DNA mutations can play a role in the development of cancer, but they are not the only cause. \nSo, to answer your question: DNA mutations can sometimes lead to cancer, but this is not always the case.

    "answer": "Planes with multiple wings, like the one in the image you provided, are called \"multiplane\" or \"sesquiplane\" designs. These designs were experimented with in the early days of aviation, but they were not widely used because they did not perform as well as planes with fewer wings. \nThere are several reasons why planes with multiple wings are not typically used. One reason is that they are more complex and expensive to build than planes with fewer wings. They also tend to be heavier and less efficient, which means that they require more power to fly and use more fuel. \nPlanes with two wings, or \"biplanes,\" were the most common design in the early days of aviation. They are still used today in some specialty applications, such as crop dusting or airshows. Most modern planes, however, have a single, long wing called a \"monoplane.\" This design is more aerodynamic and efficient, and it allows the plane to fly faster and further than a biplane. \nFour-winged planes, or \"quadruplanes,\" have also been experimented with, but they have not been widely used because they do not offer significant advantages over other designs. \nOverall, the number of wings on an airplane is determined by a combination of factors, including the size and weight of the plane, the type of mission it will be used for, and the desired performance characteristics. Engineers and designers carefully consider these factors when designing a new plane to ensure that it is safe, efficient, and capable of meeting the needs of its intended use.",

It 's tempting to think that evolution means useless things should disappear over time , sort of like a genetic atrophy , but they do n't work that way . Something has to specifically select _ against _ the useless feature . If having wisdom teeth made people less attractive , or raised the likelihood of them dying before reproducing , then we could postulate that there would be evolutionary pressure against larger wisdom teeth and that , over time , more and more people with smaller wisdom teeth would be selected , leading to a gradual evolutionary decline in wisdom teeth .

    "answer": "Wisdom teeth, also known as third molars, are the last teeth to emerge in the mouth, usually appearing in the late teenage years or early twenties. These teeth were once an important part of the human diet because they helped people chew tough and fibrous foods that were common in our ancestors' diets. \nHowever, as our diets have changed and become softer over time, wisdom teeth have become less necessary. In many people, there is not enough room in the mouth for the wisdom teeth to emerge properly, which can cause problems such as pain, infection, and crowding of the other teeth. \nIt's not entirely clear why wisdom teeth still exist if they can cause so many problems. Some scientists believe that wisdom teeth may have once served a useful purpose but are now vestigial, meaning that they have lost their original function due to evolution. Others think that wisdom teeth may still have some use, but more research is needed to understand this. \nOverall, wisdom teeth are a leftover from our ancestors' times and are not as important as they once were.

A camera: You'll need a camera that can take long exposures, which means it can keep the shutter open for a longer time to let in more light. This is important because the Milky Way is usually too dim to see with the naked eye, so you need to take a long exposure to capture it. \n2. A tripod: You'll need a tripod to hold your camera steady while you take the photo. This is important because if your camera moves even a little bit while the shutter is open, the photo will come out blurry. \n3. A dark sky: To see the Milky Way, you need to be somewhere with very little light pollution. This means you need to be far away from cities, which have lots of lights that can wash out the stars. \n4. The right time of year: The Milky Way is only visible in the night sky at certain times of the year. It's best to see it in the summer months when it's high in the sky. \nOnce you have all of these things, you can set up your camera on the tripod and take a long exposure photo of the Milky Way.

    "answer": "A grand jury is a group of people who are chosen to decide whether there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime.

One difference is that grand juries don't decide whether someone is guilty or not guilty. Their job is only to decide if there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime. Grand juries also don't have to follow the same rules as a normal trial. For example, the person being investigated by the grand jury doesn't have the right to be present or to have a lawyer present during the grand jury proceedings. \nIt's not uncommon for police officers to appear before a grand jury when they are being investigated for a crime. This might happen if someone has accused the police officer of wrongdoing, or if there is evidence that the officer broke the law. If the grand jury decides that there is enough evidence to charge the police officer with a crime, then the officer will have to go to trial to face those charges.",

    "question": "What makes one tire better than another ? Why does the tire on a Bugatti cost $ 5000 but the tire on my Cruze costs $ 150 ? What 's the difference ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Suitability for purpose , where purpose has a number of dimensions . For the Bugatti , one of the dimensions has to be \" can survive the 250MPH top speed of the car , \" and cost is going to be much less of a factor , given the market space the car is aimed at ( the extremely wealthy ) . For a Cruze , budget pricing is going to be high on the list , and the top speed is maybe as high as 130MPH at a guess . Other dimensions include wet and dry grip , cold weather performance , rolling resistance ( very helpful for high EPA fuel economy estimates ) , road noise , resistance to wear , special features like runflat capability , etc . , etc .

    "question": "What makes one tire better than another ? Why does the tire on a Bugatti cost $ 5000 but the tire on my Cruze costs $ 150 ? What 's the difference ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "There are a few factors that can make one tire better than another, and these factors can also contribute to differences in price. \nFirst, let's start with the basics: tires are made of rubber, and they have tread on the bottom that helps them grip the road. Tires also have a sidewall, which is the part of the tire that you can see between the tread and the wheel. The sidewall has important information printed on it, like the size of the tire and the maximum load and speed it can handle. \nNow, let's talk about some of the factors that can make one tire better than another: \n1. Performance: Some tires are designed for specific types of driving or weather conditions. For example, you might want a tire with a softer compound for better grip on a race track, or a tire with a lot of tread for better traction in the rain. Tires that are designed for high performance or specific driving conditions tend to cost more because they require more advanced materials and engineering. \n2. Quality: Tires can also vary in terms of quality, which can affect their performance and lifespan. Higher-quality tires are typically made with better materials and more advanced manufacturing processes, which can make them last longer and perform better. These tires tend to cost more, but they can save you money in the long run because you won't have to replace them as often. \n3. Brand: The brand of the tire can also affect the price. Some tire brands are known for making high-quality, high-performance tires that come with a higher price tag. Other brands might offer more budget-friendly options that may not have the same level of performance or quality. \nSo, to sum it up: tires can vary in price based on their performance, quality, and brand. Tires that are designed for high performance or specific driving conditions, made with high-quality materials and advanced manufacturing processes, or made by a well-known brand tend to cost more.",

    "question": "How are movies edited to be in 3D when they are't originally filmed in 3D ? Like Lord of the Rings Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Movies that are not originally filmed in 3D can be converted into 3D in post-production, which means after the movie has already been filmed and is being prepared for release. To do this, the movie is first divided into two separate images, one for the left eye and one for the right eye. These images are then slightly offset from each other to create the illusion of depth when viewed through special glasses that have one red lens and one blue lens (or one green and one magenta). \nThe process of converting a 2D movie into 3D is complex and time-consuming, and it involves using computer software to analyze the images and assign different levels of depth to different objects in the frame. This allows the 3D version of the movie to have a sense of depth and perspective that makes it feel more immersive and realistic. \nSo, to sum it up, movies that are not originally filmed in 3D can be made to look like they were filmed in 3D by using special computer software to create two slightly offset images and adding depth to different objects in the frame. When these images are viewed through special glasses, they create the illusion of 3D.",

    "question": "what are the facial differences between men and women ? Just as an example here , if a head was found with no hair / eyebrows / eye lashes , how can the gender be found ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Sexual Dimorphism - Some species of animals exhibit differences between sexes so that an individual of that species can fulfil they 're reproductive and survival requirements relative to they 're species . the differences can vary for different species and there is no set characteristic for males or females . i.e. in mammals ( particularly social mammals ) males tends to be larger and stronger and physically better adapted to aggression and conflict , females tend to be better suited to child rearing ( before I get hate mail of Feminazis this is biology , not sociology ) . In Insects Females tend to be larger and better suited to child rearing , where males tend to be simply used sperm production . But back to your original question , what are the facial differences between men and women ? Sexual selection seems to be one of the key factors in later human development . determine the fundamental characteristics of each sex based on the needs and requirement of the opposite sex . For example , men tend to be larger , stronger and broader shoulders ; conversely women have wider hips , are shorter and have a higher fat to muscle ratios . These Characteristics are indicative that men historically have been considered the better fighters and women he better child carers , and in purely reproductive terms would have influenced the sexual selection of either sex , in laments terms men with more masculine features are more sexually desirable , and women with more feminine features are more sexually desirable . ( generally speaking ) However these selection characteristics have also influenced other arbitrary features that we have associated with better mates . I.e. men having wider , squarer jaw lines , and females having the converse . Women having \" softer \" facial features and men having \" harder \" facial features . This is n't an exact science and I based on generalizations , which in turn are based on social perceptions . So a forensic investigator in the situation you provided would have to used assumptions to determine the difference . However I do think there are certain aspects that are absolute , like nose to eye width ratios and so on .",

    "answer": "There are several differences between the facial features of men and women that can help to determine their gender. Here are a few examples: \n1. Men tend to have stronger and more defined jawlines, while women tend to have softer and rounder jawlines. \n2. Men tend to have thicker eyebrows, while women tend to have thinner eyebrows. \n3. Men tend to have larger noses, while women tend to have smaller noses. \n4. Men tend to have a larger distance between their eyes, while women tend to have a smaller distance between their eyes. \nIf you were trying to determine the gender of a person whose head was found with no hair, eyebrows, or eye lashes, you could look at these facial features to help you make a guess. It's important to note, however, that these are generalizations and there can be overlap between the facial features of men and women. It's also possible for someone to have facial features that don't match the typical expectations for their gender, so it's important to be mindful of this when trying to determine someone's gender.",

    "answer": "Traditionally, new seasons of TV shows have premiered in the fall because that is when the major networks (like ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox) have their \"upfronts,\" which are presentations to advertisers about the new shows that they will be airing in the upcoming television season. The upfronts usually take place in May, and the new TV seasons begin in September. This allows the networks to promote their new shows to a large audience over the summer, so that people will be more likely to watch when the new seasons begin. \nThere are a few reasons why it might make sense for some shows to come out in the spring or summer instead. For one thing, there is typically less competition for viewership during these times of year, since there are fewer new shows premiering. This can be especially helpful for shows that are trying to establish a strong following and might get lost in the shuffle during the crowded fall season. Additionally, the weather is generally nicer in the spring and summer, which can make it a more appealing time for people to sit down and watch TV. \nOverall, it really depends on the show and what the creators and networks think will be the best time for it to be released. Some shows might be more successful in the fall, while others might do better in the spring or summer.",

    "question": "how do country 's that operate a no tax policy operate ? Monaco for example Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Countries that operate a no tax policy, like Monaco, still need to find ways to fund their governments and pay for the services they provide to their citizens. One way they can do this is by relying on other sources of income, such as tourism or the sale of goods and services. \nMonaco, for example, is a small country located on the Mediterranean coast in Europe. It is known for its luxury casinos, hotels, and high-end real estate. These industries bring in a lot of money for the government and help fund the services it provides to its citizens, such as education and healthcare. \nAnother way that countries with no tax policy can fund their governments is by charging fees for certain services, such as the use of roads or the sale of licenses. These fees can provide the government with a source of income that can be used to pay for the services it provides to its citizens. \nIt's important to note that while Monaco does not have a traditional tax system, it still has certain requirements for businesses and individuals living and working in the country. For example, businesses must pay fees for the right to operate in Monaco, and individuals must pay fees to live or work in the country.

    "answer": "A strawman argument is a type of argument where someone misrepresents or misunderstands someone else's position, and then attacks this misrepresented position instead of the real position. It's like building a straw man (a dummy made of straw) to knock down, instead of fighting the real person. \nHere's an example: \nPerson A: \"I think we should recycle more because it helps the environment.\"\nPerson B: \"But you just want to force everyone to do things your way and take away our freedom.\" \nPerson B's argument is a strawman, because they misunderstood or misrepresented Person A's position. Person A never said anything about taking away freedom, they just said they think recycling is good for the environment. Person B's argument attacks this misrepresented position, instead of the real position. \nIn other words, a strawman argument is when someone sets up a \"dummy\" version of someone else's argument and then attacks that, instead of the real argument.

    "answer": "Because work goes on virtually every hour of every day in high rises . The office critters occupy and push papers and make up money during the daylight and sometimes into the evening . And Overnight / early morning there are cleaning crews maintenance / repair crews and construction crews and security people wandering about . The tenants in highrise office buildings are constantly changing , whenever a new tenant moves into a floor or subdivides a floor into multiple offices the work on the build out ca n't happen during the day since office critters would get upset if construction men were walking all over their desks and shifting stuff around while they were there . My company occasionally does high rise tenant finish and when the tenant wants a new break room or two , and the executive wants a private bathroom in his corner office then things need to be happening on multiple floors at once . The drainage piping needs to be run on the floor below , which is likely occupied . To install new drainage plumbing in a high rise a large X - ray machine needs to be brought out and shoot beams of radiation up towards the slab to find what locations are available for drilling , ( this needs to be done from the floor below ) then we bring out large core drills which make lots of noise and spray mud everywhere , which requires us to cover all the office folks computers and desks / cabinets and family photos with tarps so when they get back in the morning they do n't know we were romping around their office the previous night . Then we need to take the ceiling grid panels out from the occupied floor and bring in the equipment to install the new piping . Doing any of this during ' working hours ' , everything from bringing in large radiation machines and blasting them between their desks , to covering everyone with tarps and spraying them with mud which making a racket , would piss loads of workers off . Work like what I 'm describing will mean that three floors are completely lit up for the entire night shift , if it 's a 35 story building and 2 - 3 floors are being re - finished and there are two cleaning crews and a security / maintenance crew going around as well then that would mean 10 - 12 floors at a time minimum are lit up so people are able to work . Tl , DR : If the lights are on on a certain floor of a highrise , there are people doing some form of work on that floor , if there are no lights or the lights are dim then the floor is unoccupied at that time . I 've also heard rumors that tall buildings need to keep a certain amount of floors lit up so aeroplanes can see then easier and gauge their height / distance at night .

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why office buildings and skyscrapers might keep their lights on at night: \n1. Safety: One reason is for safety purposes. Keeping the lights on can help people navigate the building and find their way around, especially in case of an emergency. \n2. Security: Another reason is for security. Having the lights on can deter burglars and vandals, and also help security personnel keep an eye on the building. \n3. Convenience: Some people might be working late or overnight in the building, and they might need the lights on to do their work. \n4. Energy efficiency: In some cases, the lights in office buildings and skyscrapers might be designed to be energy efficient, so they don't use as much energy as you might think. Additionally, turning the lights off and on frequently can actually use more energy than leaving them on, because it takes energy to start up the lighting system each time it is turned on. \n5. Cost: Finally, it might be more expensive to turn the lights off and on all the time than to just leave them on. This is because each time the lights are turned on and off, it causes wear and tear on the lighting system, which can shorten its lifespan and increase maintenance costs. \nOverall, there are a number of factors to consider when deciding whether to keep the lights on in an office building or skyscraper, and it's not always as simple as just turning them off to save money.",

    "answer": "Progressive taxation is a system in which people who earn more money pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than people who earn less money. In the United States, the progressive tax system is designed to reduce income inequality by taking a larger percentage of income from people who are more able to pay, and using that money to fund programs and services that benefit the entire population, such as education, healthcare, and social security. \nHowever, there are still many factors that can contribute to inequality in the United States, even with a progressive tax system in place. For example, some people may have access to better education and job opportunities, which can lead to higher incomes. Additionally, there may be systemic biases and discrimination that make it more difficult for certain groups of people to advance in their careers or earn as much as others. \nFinally, the overall distribution of wealth in a society, rather than just income, also plays a role in inequality. Wealth, or the total value of a person's assets (such as their savings, investments, and property), can be passed down from generation to generation, which can create a more unequal distribution of resources over time. \nOverall, while a progressive tax system can help to reduce inequality, it is just one factor among many that contribute to the overall level of inequality in a society.",

    "question": "How does a star ( such as sol ) work ? They are just floating balls of energy , how do they just not explode or collapse on themselves ? please go to into detail Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "A star is an immense ball of gas , mostly hydrogen and helium . The gravitational pull draws the gasses towards the center of the star . This creates incredible pressure . The pressure causes nuclear fusion , which fuses hydrogen atoms into helium , releasing a lot of energy in the process . This energy pushes outwards , working against the gravitational pull and preventing the star from collapsing inwards .",

    "answer": "Stars, like our own Sun, are made up of very hot gases, mostly hydrogen and helium. They give off energy in the form of light and heat, which is what we feel here on Earth as sunlight. \nStars are able to stay in balance and not explode or collapse because of something called nuclear fusion. This is a process that happens in the center of the star, where the temperature and pressure are extremely high. In nuclear fusion, the hydrogen atoms combine to form helium atoms, and this releases a huge amount of energy in the form of light and heat. \nThis energy helps to hold the star up and keep it from collapsing in on itself. The energy from nuclear fusion also helps to push outwards against the weight of the outer layers of the star, which would otherwise cause the star to collapse. \nIn short, the energy produced by nuclear fusion helps to balance the forces acting on a star and keeps it from collapsing or exploding.",

    "question": "Why does scratching my back relieve an itch but having someone else scratch it make it damn near orgasmic ? It 's just one of the best experiences of human contact , to me . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "When any part of our body is touched , nerves in the skin are activated . On the way to the brain , those nerves meet at several junctions or ' gates ' . At those junctions , bunches of nerves coming from nearby all gather together on the way to the brain At each gate , the signals from all the bundled nerves are processed together . Sometimes , two nerves work together to increase each other 's intensity , and sometimes , they dampen each other 's signals . At the same time , nerves coming from the brain work as ' central control ' to change the intensity of the signal that 's being passed on . Again , sometimes the signal is increased , and sometimes it 's decreased . Over the history of their development , our brains have gotten good at learning what signals they should pay attention to , and what signals they can ignore . One of the signals the brain has learned to ' ignore ' is self touch . It is n't dangerous , and we usually only need to be partially aware of it . Walking through a spider web and touching your hand to your face are two different experiences , and for good reason . When the brain identifies self - touch , it uses those feedback fibers I mentioned before to suppress the intensity of sensation , which makes it easier to ignore . Also , when a signal arrives in the brain , several regions cooperate to figure out exactly what it is , where it came from , and what to do about it . When we identify self - touch , there are regions of our brain that are trained to say ' ignore it ' . As a result , we suppress the intensity of those signals .",

    "answer": "When you scratch your own back, you are applying pressure to the skin and nerves in that area, which can help to relieve the sensation of an itch. When someone else scratches your back, the sensation may be even more pleasurable because it combines the physical sensation of the scratching with the emotional pleasure of being touched by someone else. It's also possible that having someone else scratch your back may allow you to scratch in areas that are difficult to reach on your own, which could further increase the pleasure of the experience. Ultimately, the pleasure of having someone else scratch your back is likely due to a combination of physical and emotional factors.",

    "answer": "Landing a spacecraft in a lake would not be a safe or practical way to return to Earth. Here are a few reasons why: \n1. Density: Water is much denser than air, so when a spacecraft falls into it from a high altitude, it will experience much more resistance and deceleration. This could cause the spacecraft to break apart or sustain serious damage upon impact. \n2. Depth: Lakes are typically not very deep, so if a spacecraft were to land in one, it would have to do so at a very low altitude. This would not give the spacecraft enough time to slow down and make a safe landing. \n3. Control: When a spacecraft returns to Earth, it needs to be able to control its descent and land in a specific location. This is not possible when landing in a lake, as the spacecraft would be at the mercy of the wind and currents. \n4. Recovery: Finally, it would be very difficult to recover a spacecraft that has landed in a lake. Specialized equipment would be needed to lift it out of the water, which could be time-consuming and costly. \nIn summary, landing a spacecraft in a lake is not a safe or practical option. Instead, spacecraft are designed to land on solid ground, where they can touch down at a controlled speed and be easily recovered.",

    "answer": "A person's net worth is a measure of how much wealth they have. It's the total value of all the things they own, minus any debts or liabilities they have. \nTo calculate a person's net worth, you would add up the value of all their assets, such as their house, car, savings accounts, stocks, and other investments. Then, you would subtract any debts or liabilities they have, such as credit card balances, student loans, or mortgages. The result is their net worth. \nFor example, if a person has $100,000 in savings, a house worth $300,000, and no debts, their net worth would be $400,000. On the other hand, if that same person had $100,000 in savings, a house worth $300,000, and a mortgage of $200,000, their net worth would be $200,000 (since they would be subtracting the $200,000 mortgage from their total assets of $400,000). \nNet worth is usually calculated by a person themselves, or by a financial advisor or accountant. It can be a useful way to track a person's financial progress over time and see how much wealth they have built up. \nIt's important to note that net worth is different from income, which is the money a person earns from working or investing. A person's net worth reflects their overall financial situation, while their income is just one part of it.",

    "question": "Can US ever repay its national debt ? Is it possible to ever get the 17 or so trillion dollar debt back to 0 and how so ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "I think it goes without saying that government is n't really anything like personal debt but it might help put things in perspective using a more familiar idea we can grasp . Part of the problem with the perception of our debt being a big problem is that the numbers are big . Mind bogglingly big . Scary big . Our debt is roughly $ 17,000,000,000,000 . And , yes , that is a big number . But let me show you another number : $ 17,000,000,000,000 . Why , yes . That is the same number . $ 17,000,000,000,000 also happens to be our Gross Domestic Product or GDP , which is what our country produces in a year . Think of the GDP as our annual salary as a country . Now if you met a person who made $ 170,000 a year ( a much easier number to get your head around ) and that person was in debt to the tune of $ 170,000 say with a house a couple of credit cards and that person always paid all of his bills all the time , most people would say that person has very good credit and is n't at risk of going bankrupt and would likely be a particularly good candidate if they decided to get another loan . And so long as their income grows proportionally with their debt and they keep paying their bills , they 'll continue to be a safe bet to continue to receive loans . In other words , if their debt rose to $ 200,000 , that 'd be okay if their income was also in the neighborhood of $ 200,000 . Now what you want to know is : Can the debt ever be repaid ? And the simple answer is , \" yes , but you would n't really want to \" . Keeping our house metaphor in tact for the time being , if we wanted to get out of debt , we could pay less for the stuff we use and use the difference to pay down our debt . But there 's a problem : What do we cut ? Food ? Medicine ? Clothing ? Home Security ? Everything we 're spending money on we more or less need . Sure , we could nibble around the edges and find a few dollars here and there , but not enough to make a really big difference . Going back to our full scale US debt , it sounds good to say you 're going to cut our $ 10 million budget for ketchup research or $ 6 million in pork for a courthouse in Milwaukee , but that 's like saying you 're going to pay off your mortgage by rummaging around for spare change in your couch . When trillions are on the table , millions wo n't cut it and billions will barely touch it . Which is n't to say it 's impossible . Just about 20 years ago the Clinton administration had a plan to pay down the national debt by raising taxes and cutting spending . According to that plan , we would have paid off the national debt by the far off future year of 2011 . Unfortunately , when we went to war in Afghanistan and Iraq in 2002 and 2003 , that added expense sidelined the debt repayment and ballooned our debt . And then in 2008 and 2009 the financial crisis happened and various stimulus packages and tax relief packages meant our debt ballooned again . It 's really been a lousy decade for debt and deficit . But have no fear : Should we do the obvious yet politically suicidal thing of raising taxes and cutting spending we can get our debt under control again ( until the next big crisis , at least ) . But we do n't want to pay it off , mostly because a lot of our debt is n't owned by foreign countries : it 's owned by people like you and me in the form of government bonds . ( Basically you buy XX in IOUs from the government and they 'll pay you back XX plus interest after a given amount of time and these are generally seen as safe but low(er ) return parts of many investment portfolios for individuals and businesses . ) If the government is debt free , that means there are no bonds to invest in , which is n't very good for the economy . Economists might disagree on how much debt is good and how much is bad but most would agree that it 's best to have some . So that it . Our debt is big , but it 's not concerning because it 's about the same size as our GDP . It should probably be at least a little smaller , which is simple and hard because everyone knows what needs to be done ( higher taxes and lower spending ) but nobody is willing to do it . But much like needing to lose weight you ca n't just exercise more OR cut calories , you 've got to do both . And while we could one day , 20 , 30 years from now slowly get to zero with modest cuts and tax hikes , we do n't really need to or want to because it would mean lower , slower economic growth as a nation and fewer quality investment opportunities for individuals and businesses .",

    "question": "Can US ever repay its national debt ? Is it possible to ever get the 17 or so trillion dollar debt back to 0 and how so ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The United States national debt is the total amount of money that the federal government owes to its creditors. The debt is currently about $28 trillion and it is possible for it to be repaid, but it would require the government to make regular payments to its creditors to reduce the balance. \nThere are a few ways that the government could make these payments: \n1. By running budget surpluses: This means that the government would bring in more money through taxes and other revenues than it spends on things like defense, education, and healthcare. The extra money could be used to pay down the debt. \n2. By selling assets: The government could sell things like land, buildings, or other assets to raise money to pay off the debt. \n3. By growing the economy: If the economy grows, the government will bring in more money through taxes, which could be used to pay down the debt. \nIt is important to note that the national debt is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it can be a useful tool for the government to fund important projects and stimulate the economy. However, if the debt gets too large, it can become difficult for the government to make the necessary payments, which could lead to financial problems.",

    "answer": "The Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the United States. It was created in 1787 and has been amended a few times since then. Even though it was created a long time ago, it is still relevant today because it sets out the basic principles and structure of the government and protects certain fundamental rights of the people. These principles and rights are still important today, even though technology and society have changed a lot since the Constitution was written. \nFor example, the Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, religion, and the press. These rights are important no matter what technology is being used, because they protect the ability of people to express their ideas and beliefs without fear of punishment. \nThe Constitution also sets out the powers of the different branches of government, such as the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. These powers are still important today, because they help to ensure that the government is accountable to the people and that no one branch of government becomes too powerful. \nSo even though the Constitution was written a long time ago, it is still very relevant today because it sets out the basic principles and structure of the government and protects important rights of the people.",

They do this by contacting the debtor and trying to get them to pay the debt. If they are successful in getting the debtor to pay, then the company that bought the debt makes a profit. \nHere's an example: \nCompany A sells a product to Company B for $100.\nCompany B doesn't pay Company A for the product.\nCompany A decides it doesn't want to try to collect the debt, so it sells the debt to Company C for $50.\nCompany C contacts Company B and tries to get them to pay the debt.\nIf Company B agrees to pay the debt, then Company C will have made a profit of $50 ($100 - $50 = $50). \nSo, in short, companies that buy and re-sell debt make money by collecting the debts that they have purchased and keeping the difference between the amount they paid for the debt and the amount they were able to collect.",

    "answer": "Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is a fundamental idea in quantum mechanics, which is a theory that describes how very small things (like atoms and subatomic particles) behave. According to the uncertainty principle, it is impossible to know both the exact position and the exact momentum (speed and direction) of a particle at the same time. \nThis might seem strange, but imagine trying to measure the position of a small insect flying around a room. If you want to know exactly where the insect is, you might try to shine a flashlight on it. But as soon as you shine the light on the insect, you change its momentum (because the light has energy, and when it hits the insect it gives some of that energy to the insect). So now you know where the insect is, but you don't know its momentum as well as you did before. On the other hand, if you don't shine any light on the insect, you might be able to figure out its momentum (for example, by clapping your hands and trying to chase it), but now you don't know its position as well as you did before. \nThe uncertainty principle tells us that there is always a trade-off between knowing the position and knowing the momentum of a particle. The more precisely we know one of these things, the less precisely we can know the other. This is a fundamental aspect of the nature of the universe at very small scales, and it has important implications for how we understand the world around us.",

    "question": "How exactly does a transformator transform energy to a lower voltage ? * transformer , sorry everyone :p Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "A transformer is a device that uses electricity to transfer energy from one circuit to another through a process called electrical induction. It does this by using coils of wire and a magnetic field. \nInside a transformer, there are two coils of wire called the primary coil and the secondary coil. The primary coil is connected to a source of electricity, such as a power outlet, and the secondary coil is connected to a device that needs electricity, such as a lamp. \nWhen electricity flows through the primary coil, it creates a magnetic field around the coil. This magnetic field then causes a current to flow in the secondary coil, which creates its own magnetic field. The two magnetic fields interact with each other, causing energy to be transferred from the primary coil to the secondary coil. \nThe amount of energy that is transferred depends on the number of coils in each of the primary and secondary coils. If the secondary coil has fewer coils than the primary coil, it will receive less energy, which means the voltage of the electricity in the secondary circuit will be lower than the voltage in the primary circuit. On the other hand, if the secondary coil has more coils than the primary coil, it will receive more energy, which means the voltage of the electricity in the secondary circuit will be higher than the voltage in the primary circuit. \nDoes this help to explain how a transformer works?",

  {
    "question": "How do parrots form words without lips ? How do parrots speak and form words when they have a beak ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Parrots are able to form words and speak because they have a highly specialized voice box called a syrinx, which is located at the base of their trachea (windpipe). The syrinx is able to produce a wide range of sounds, including different pitches and tones, which allows parrots to mimic the sounds of human speech. \nTo form words and speak, parrots use their syrinx to produce vocalizations and then shape those sounds using their beak, tongue, and the inside of their mouth. For example, parrots can move their tongue and beak to shape the sounds they produce, just like humans do with their lips and tongue when they speak. \nIt's also important to note that parrots are highly intelligent and have a strong ability to learn and imitate sounds, which is why they are able to mimic human speech and other sounds so well. So, even though they don't have lips, parrots are still able to form words and speak by using their syrinx, beak, tongue, and mouth to shape the sounds they produce. Does that make sense? Is there anything else you would like to know about how parrots speak and form words?",

    "answer": "I ve designed capacitive touch systems and have a basic idea of how they work . The thickness is a big factor . Capacitive touch works by building an electro magnetic field like what is used to store a charge in a capacitor . It detects touch based on something disrupting that field . The actual method of that is pretty much voodoo to me . The field only protrudes from the screen a tiny amount . Some phones like the S4 note actually use a stronger field so it can sense gestures above the screen . But the reason screen protectors do n't block it is because they are thin and some materials are less obstructive to the field . The data sheet for the components I used in my design had a table of what materials work best for the cover panel .",

    "answer": "A touchscreen works by using an electric current to detect when and where you touch the screen. The screen itself is made of a material that conducts electricity, and your finger is also a conductor of electricity. When you touch the screen with your finger, you interrupt the flow of electricity, and the phone's touchscreen can detect this interruption and figure out where on the screen you touched. \nA screen protector is made of a material that does not conduct electricity, so it does not interrupt the flow of electricity when you touch the screen. This is why you can still use a touchscreen with a screen protector on it. \nGloves, on the other hand, are made of insulating materials that do not conduct electricity. This means that when you touch the screen with a gloved finger, the flow of electricity is not interrupted, and the touchscreen cannot detect your touch. \nA stylus is a special pen-like tool that you can use to write or draw on a touchscreen. It has a small, conductive tip that can interrupt the flow of electricity when you touch the screen with it. This allows the touchscreen to detect your touch even if you are using a stylus instead of your finger. \nConductive thread is a special type of thread that is made of a material that conducts electricity. It is often used in clothing or other fabric items to create touch-sensitive surfaces or to connect electronic components to each other. Copper wire is also a conductor of electricity, and it is often used in electronics and electrical systems for this reason.",

    "answer": "In science, a theory is a well-supported explanation for a set of observations or phenomena. A theory is not the same thing as a guess or a hunch. Instead, a theory is based on a lot of evidence and has been tested and refined over time. \nA law, on the other hand, is a statement that describes an observed pattern in nature. For example, the law of gravity states that objects with mass are attracted to each other. Like a theory, a law is based on evidence, but it is usually simpler and more straightforward than a theory. \nA theory can become a law if it is supported by a lot of evidence and is widely accepted by the scientific community. However, it is important to note that even a law can be changed or revised if new evidence is discovered that contradicts it. In science, it is important to always be open to new evidence and to be willing to change our understanding of the world based on that evidence. \nOverall, the main difference between a theory and a law is that a theory explains a set of observations, while a law describes an observed pattern. A theory can become a law if it is widely accepted and supported by a lot of evidence.",

And they 're fantastic at coming up with \" logical \" justifications for purely emotional reactions . No one 's more susceptible to confirmation bias , than a person who is already very good at collecting and assembling data . This guy actually wrote a book about it : [ Smart People Believe Weird Things ] ( URL_0 ) As for how this relates to vaccines in particular ... Parents usually have a gut aversion to harming their own child . Giving a child a vaccine involves - at the very least ! - tears , fever , and a swollen arm .

And you 've got the perfect recipe for an educated anti - vaxxer . I completely understand where they 're coming from . When I got pregnant with my first child , I read everything I could get my hands on . I had to sort through solid science and crunchy granola pseudo science , and a General Arts degree really does n't equip you to do that well . There were so many questions ! Should I have my child in hospital , where I have access to better equipment and specialists but also a higher risk of iatrogenic infections , or do I have my child at home , where there 's less risk of infection but a higher chance I wo n't get immediate help if something goes wrong ? I compromised on a midwife - attended homebirth . Do I get the neonatal heel prick to test for Phenylketonuria , even though it means my child 's first experience after birth is one of pain ( and I 'd read that newborn nervous systems are super sensitive ) ? Yes . Welcome to the world , little girl , this wo n't be the most painful thing you experience in your life ! Do I have my son circumcised ? No , the benefits do n't seem compelling enough . And what about vaccination ? I have to admit I waffled at first . Some of the anti - vaxxers stories made me cry . I talked to my doctor and he said it was my decision . I went to a Public Health info session , and I listened , and then I looked around the room . There were a LOT of parents in there , swearing off vaccinating their kids . And I thought , \" Wow , there goes any hope of herd immunity . I 'd better get my kids vaccinated . \" Now , of course , I 'm a huge proponent of vaccination . I 've even started insisting the family get their flu shot every year , even though the last time I got it done it messed up my shoulder .

    "answer": "Assisted suicide and lethal injection are two different things. Assisted suicide refers to a situation where a person chooses to end their own life with the help of another person, usually a doctor, who provides the means for the person to do so. Lethal injection, on the other hand, is a method of execution used by some governments to carry out the death penalty on people who have been convicted of certain crimes. \nIn assisted suicide, the goal is to help a person who is suffering from a terminal illness or other severe medical condition to end their life in a peaceful and dignified manner. This can be done through the use of medication that the person takes themselves, or through other methods such as inhaling gases. The goal is to cause the person to fall asleep and then pass away peacefully, without experiencing any pain or suffering. \nLethal injection, on the other hand, is a method of execution that is intended to quickly and painlessly cause the death of the person being executed. It involves injecting the person with a combination of drugs that are designed to stop their heart and other vital functions. The goal is to cause the person to pass away quickly and without experiencing any pain or suffering. \nThe main difference between assisted suicide and lethal injection is the context in which they are used. Assisted suicide is used to help people who are suffering from terminal illnesses or other severe medical conditions to end their lives in a peaceful and dignified manner, while lethal injection is used as a means of carrying out the death penalty on people who have been convicted of certain crimes.",

    "answer": "It's important to note that the perception that most serial killers are from North America may be influenced by the amount of media coverage and attention that these cases receive. In reality, serial killers can be found all over the world. \nThere are a few possible explanations for why there may be a higher number of serial killers in the United States and Canada compared to other countries. One reason could be that these countries have larger populations, so there may simply be more people living there who are capable of committing crimes like this. Additionally, the United States and Canada may have more effective law enforcement and criminal justice systems, which may make it more likely for serial killers to be caught and their crimes to be properly investigated and reported on. \nIt's also possible that cultural and societal factors may play a role in the prevalence of serial killers in certain countries. However, it's important to note that the motivations and circumstances behind each individual's actions are complex and varied, and it's not accurate or fair to make broad generalizations about a group of people based on their nationality or location.",

    "question": "How can one infinity be bigger than another infinity ? URL_0 Can someone explain the proof to me ? It doesn;It make sense to me . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "It has to do with one - to - one correspondences . So for example , with every natural number we can relate exactly one even number , therefore we say the set of naturals and the set of even numbers have the same \" cardinality \" . This is true even thought the set of even numbers is a \" proper subset \" of the natural numbers . It can be shown , however , that there exists * no * one - to - one correspondence between the naturals and the real numbers , therefore their cardinalities differ . And also with every natural number you can relate * at least * one real number ( namely the number itself , e.g. 0 with 0 , 1 with 1 , etc . ) , so we say that the set of real numbers has greater cardinality than the set of natural numbers . What it is n't true is that you can relate every real number with a natural number . To get a better understanding I suggest you learn what an \" injection \" , a \" surjection \" , and a \" bijection \" is . ( A bijection is a function which is in a one - to - one correspondence . And also you can show a function is a bijection if and only if it is a surjection and an injection . )",

    "question": "How can one infinity be bigger than another infinity ? URL_0 Can someone explain the proof to me ? It doesn;It make sense to me . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "In mathematics, there are different sizes of infinity, called \"cardinalities.\" The size of a set (a collection of objects) is referred to as its cardinality. For example, the set of all positive integers (1, 2, 3, 4, ...) has an infinite number of elements, so it has a cardinality of infinity. However, there are some sets that have a larger cardinality than others, even though they are both infinite. \nFor example, consider the set of all positive integers and the set of all fractions (numbers that can be written as a ratio of two integers, such as 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, etc.). Both sets are infinite, but there are more fractions than there are positive integers. To see why, think about the fact that for every integer, there is at least one corresponding fraction (for example, the integer 1 corresponds to the fraction 1/1, the integer 2 corresponds to the fraction 2/1, and so on). But there are also many fractions that do not correspond to any integer (for example, 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, etc.). Therefore, the set of fractions has a larger cardinality than the set of positive integers. \nThis may seem counterintuitive, because we usually think of larger numbers as being \"bigger\" than smaller numbers. However, when it comes to infinity, things work a little differently. It's not really accurate to say that one infinity is \"bigger\" than another, because infinity is not a number and it is not quantifiable in the same way that numbers are. Instead, we say that one set has a \"larger cardinality\" than another set to describe the fact that there are more elements in one set than in the other, even though both sets are infinite. \nI hope this helps!

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why gas prices in the US have recently become lower. One reason is that there has been a decrease in the demand for gasoline due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic downturn. When people are driving less and there is less demand for gasoline, the price tends to go down. \nAnother reason is that there is currently a surplus of oil and gasoline, which means there is more of these products available than people are currently using. This can also cause the price to go down. \nIt's hard to predict exactly how long gas prices will stay low, as they are influenced by a number of different factors. These can include things like the global demand for oil, the price of oil, and the cost of transporting gasoline to different parts of the country. \nIn general, it's important to remember that the price of gasoline can fluctuate over time, depending on a variety of factors.

The MAHLI camera has a very high-resolution lens, which allows it to take detailed close-up images of the rover's body and wheels. \nTo take a picture of itself, the rover first has to position its arm and camera in the right place. It does this by using sensors and motors to move the arm and adjust the camera's angle. \nOnce the arm and camera are in the right position, the rover sends a command to the MAHLI camera to take a picture. The camera then uses a flash to light up the scene and captures an image with its high-resolution lens. The image is then transmitted back to Earth, where scientists can analyze it and learn more about the rover and its environment on Mars. \nI hope this helps!

    "answer": "A strawman theory or strawman argument is a type of misrepresentation of an opposing position. It involves presenting a distorted or exaggerated version of someone's argument in order to make it easier to attack or refute. This can be done intentionally, in an attempt to deceive or mislead, or it can be done unintentionally, due to a lack of understanding or knowledge about the opposing position. \nFor example, imagine that there is a debate about whether or not to build a new highway through a particular region. One side of the argument might be in favor of building the highway, while the other side is opposed. If the side in favor of the highway presents a strawman argument, they might exaggerate or distort the arguments of the opposing side, making it seem like they are opposed to all forms of transportation or development, when in reality their objections may be more nuanced or limited in scope. This allows the side in favor of the highway to more easily attack or refute the opposing position, even though they have not accurately represented it. \nIt's important to be aware of strawman arguments and to try to avoid using them in discussions or debates. It's better to accurately represent the opposing position and engage with it on its own terms, rather than trying to deceive or mislead others by distorting it.",

The term \" cold \" actually refers to thousands of different possible viruses that all do basically the same thing . Viruses can only reproduce inside a host cell . When they do so , they make copies of themselves using the cell 's own machinery and then burst out , rupturing it . DISCLAIMER : THE FOLLOWING IS NOT A PERFECT METAPHOR ; IT IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY . NITPICKERS WILL BE CRITICIZED FOR REDDITING ON A FRIDAY . Think of a virus as a zombie in the crowded shopping mall that is your throat . It staggers in out of the night , bedraggled and ugly . A teen girl snickers . A businessman walks by talking on his cell phone , ignoring the presumably drunk homeless man . Mall security has n't noticed yet . Likewise , when the virus first entered your throat , your immune system had n't recognized it yet . Then the zombie bites somebody ! Someone screams ! Security comes running and tries to taze what they think is a drifter high on bath salts . ( although it should be noted that one viral body is almost never enough to start a full blown infection- it 's more likely you inhaled tiny airborn particles of somebody else 's snot or spit that were actually teeming with them ) So , fuck it , I guess ten more zombies follow out of the darkness . Nobody knows what 's going on . There 's screaming . Madness . The immune cells do n't yet know what 's going on . Mall security is frantic , plugging rounds into the zombies ' torsos to no effect ( they have not yet encountered this virus and are n't as adept at dealing with it as they eventually will be ) . Those bitten reanimate soon , and the undead swell in rank . Not all those who die are killed by the zombies . Some who are bitten sacrifice themselves , going out on their [ own terms . ] ( URL_0 ) Likewise , some infected cells are able to mark themselves for destruction . The police have n't shown up yet . I think it 's likely that your throat has n't swelled up yet as an immune response . But your nerves know something is up . There is cell damage taking place . People have huddled in janitors ' closets to call their loved ones . It 's very localized , not enough to \" hurt\"- the city is not full of the walking dead yet , just the shopping center- and so you feel an itch rather than full blown pain . I suspect that you have not hit the worst of it yet . Maybe you 'll get lucky and the police will cap them all before it gets too out of control . Best of luck !",

    "question": "Why does my throat feels itchy ? Yes , I have the cold , but what 's actually happening in there ? It 's annoying as hell ! Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "When you have a cold, your throat may feel itchy because your body is trying to fight off the infection. When you're sick, your immune system kicks into gear and works to rid your body of the virus or bacteria that is causing the illness. One way that your body does this is by producing more mucus. Mucus is a thick, sticky substance that helps to trap and remove germs from your body. \nWhen you have a cold, your body may produce more mucus than usual, and this can make your throat feel itchy. The extra mucus can also cause your throat to feel sore or scratchy. \nIn addition to mucus, your body may also produce more saliva when you're sick. Saliva is a watery substance that helps to keep your mouth and throat moist. When you have a cold, you may produce more saliva than usual, which can also make your throat feel itchy. \nIt's also possible that the itchy feeling in your throat is caused by irritation from coughing or sneezing. When you cough or sneeze, the muscles in your throat and chest contract, which can cause your throat to feel itchy. \nOverall, the itchy feeling in your throat when you have a cold is caused by a combination of factors, including an increase in mucus and saliva production, as well as irritation from coughing or sneezing.",

    "answer": "While reducing volume of the trash is novel , it 's not economically viable in most places on Earth because we 're not hurting for the space . But that 's not why we do n't do it .

    "answer": "Burning trash is not a good solution for several reasons. \nFirst, burning trash can release harmful chemicals and pollutants into the air. These pollutants can have negative effects on human health and the environment. They can cause respiratory problems, heart disease, and other health problems. \nSecond, burning trash is not an efficient way to get rid of it. Many materials that we throw away, such as plastic and metal, do not burn well and can create harmful emissions when they are burned. \nFinally, burning trash takes up a lot of energy, which can be better used for other purposes. It is generally more efficient and environmentally friendly to recycle materials or find other ways to reuse them, rather than burning them. \nInstead of burning trash, it is important to reduce, reuse, and recycle as much as possible. This can help to reduce the amount of waste that we produce and minimize the negative impacts on the environment.",

    "answer": "Green olives are sometimes stuffed with ingredients like pimentos, garlic, or cheese to add flavor to the olives. People stuff olives in this way because it can make them taste more interesting and add a different texture to the olive. \nThere are a few different ways that olives can be stuffed. Some olives are stuffed by hand, while others are stuffed using machines in a factory. In either case, the process usually involves removing the pit or seed from the center of the olive and then filling the hole with the desired stuffing. The stuffed olive is then usually placed back into a brine solution to preserve it. \nSo, while there might not be any elves involved in the process, there are people (or machines) working to stuff the olives and make them ready for you to enjoy.",

    "answer": "They know where their home nest is , and can navigate back there using [ magnetism ] ( URL_0 ) . The idea is that you raise the birds at military headquarters , then when they 're adults , you cage them and take them with you on campaigns . To send messages back to headquarters , you tie a note to them and then let them free , and they 'll fly back home . Someone at headquarters keeps an eye out for returning birds and reads the attached notes . They do not work two - way ; you can not tell a bird an arbitrary location to fly to , and headquarters can not communicate back to you in the same way . Unless , of course , they have a captive bird that was raised where you are now . Headquarters might keep a number of birds raised at specific outposts and use those to communicate to the nearest one to you , though -- so you might say \" Headquarters , I 'm 140 miles south of Outpost X and we 're negotiating with the Evil Skeleton King , would you accept these terms ? \" , and Headquarters might send a bird from Outpost X home with the note \" Send a messenger 140 miles south with the message blah blah blah . \" Birds specially bred for this can travel vast distances at pretty high speeds , and of course , are n't impeded by rivers or other obstacles like a human on horseback would be , so they can travel in a straight line . A bird dispatched from London at breakfast could be in Berlin by dinner . The downside is that you have a limited number of birds , and that you have no way of knowing if your messages arrived on time or if the bird was killed en route . Messenger birds are only used by hobbyists today because we obviously have much more instant and reliable forms of communication .

    "answer": "In the TV show Game of Thrones, messenger ravens are fictional creatures that are used to send messages from one place to another. They are able to fly long distances and deliver messages to their intended recipients. In the show, the ravens are able to understand the messages that they are meant to deliver, and they fly to the designated location to deliver the message. \nIn real life, messenger birds are not able to understand and deliver messages like in the show. However, there are other ways that people have used birds to send messages. For example, homing pigeons have been used for centuries to carry messages over long distances. Homing pigeons have an innate ability to find their way back to their home loft, even if they are released from a different location. This ability has been used by people to send messages between distant locations. \nHoming pigeons are trained to fly to a specific location, and they are released from that location with a message attached to their leg. The pigeon then flies back to its home loft, where the message can be retrieved. Homing pigeons have been used in a variety of situations, including during wars to deliver important messages between military units. \nSo, while messenger ravens may not be a real thing, homing pigeons and other birds have been used in the past to send messages from one place to another.",

    "answer": "The colonists in the American colonies in the 1700s did not dislike the British as a whole, but they did have a number of grievances with the British government and the way they were being treated. One of the main issues was that the colonists felt that they were not being treated as equals by the British and were being unfairly taxed. They also resented the fact that they had no representation in the British government and were being dictated to by officials who had no understanding of their needs or concerns. \nIn addition to these political issues, the colonists also had cultural and economic differences with the British. Many of the colonists had come to the New World to escape religious persecution and sought to establish their own way of life. They also wanted to be able to control their own economic destiny and believed that the British were trying to exploit their resources for their own benefit. \nOverall, the colonists' decision to go to war with the British was driven by a combination of political, cultural, and economic factors, and it was a complex and multifaceted conflict.",

When you are on vacation, you may be eating sweet fruits or other foods that attract fruit flies, and they may be drawn to the smells of your body. Additionally, if you are in a warm, humid location, this may also attract fruit flies. \nFruit flies do not intentionally try to annoy humans, they are simply drawn to things that they are attracted to, such as sweet smells and warm, moist environments. They may also be attracted to any moist or sweet substances that are left out, such as open containers of soda or fruit. \nIf you want to avoid attracting fruit flies, you can try to keep your surroundings clean and free of sweet or moist substances that might attract them.

    "answer": "The smell in bowling alleys is likely a combination of several things. One possible contributor to the smell is the oil used to maintain the lanes. Bowling lanes are coated with a thin layer of oil to help the bowling ball glide smoothly down the lane and create a predictable hooking pattern when it reaches the end. This oil can give off a distinctive smell, especially if it's not been recently applied. \nAnother possible contributor to the smell in bowling alleys is the shoes that people wear when they bowl. Bowling shoes are made of leather and rubber, which can give off a certain smell when they are worn for an extended period of time. Many people also bring food and drinks into bowling alleys, which can add to the overall smell of the space. \nOverall, the smell in bowling alleys is likely a combination of all these factors, and it may vary slightly from one alley to another depending on the specific products and materials used in that particular location.",

    "answer": "In general, major sporting events like football and basketball games are free to watch on TV because they are broadcast by networks that have paid for the rights to show the games. These networks make money by selling advertisements during the broadcasts. \nOn the other hand, many boxing and MMA events are pay-per-view (PPV) events, which means that people have to pay to watch them on TV. This is because the organizers of these events have made arrangements with cable and satellite companies to show the events on PPV, and the money from the PPV fees goes to the organizers and the fighters. \nOne reason that boxing and MMA events might be more likely to be PPV is that they tend to be less popular than football and basketball, and therefore don't attract as many viewers or as much advertising money. As a result, the organizers of these events may need to charge a fee in order to cover their costs and make a profit.",

    "answer": "The 1 in front of phone numbers is called a country code, and it is used to identify which country a phone number belongs to. This is especially important when making international phone calls, because it helps the phone system route the call to the correct country. \nThe use of country codes for phone numbers started when telephone systems were first developed in the late 1800s and early 1900s. At that time, each country had its own telephone system, and it was important to be able to distinguish between different countries when making phone calls. The 1 in front of phone numbers in the United States is the country code for the United States, and it is used to identify phone numbers in the United States when making international phone calls. \nThe country code is typically followed by an area code, which is used to identify a specific region or city within a country. The area code is followed by the local phone number, which is used to identify a specific phone line within a region or city. For example, if you want to call a phone number in the United States, you would dial 1 (the country code for the United States), followed by the area code (which might be something like 212 for New York City), followed by the local phone number (which might be something like 555-1212). \nI hope that helps!

    "answer": "Recovering drug addicts may not be able to have alcohol because it can interfere with their recovery and increase the risk of relapse. Alcohol is a psychoactive substance that can alter mood and behavior, and it can be particularly dangerous for people who are in recovery from drug addiction because it can trigger cravings and lead to a return to drug use. \nAdditionally, many people who struggle with drug addiction also struggle with alcohol addiction, or they may have a co-occurring disorder such as alcohol use disorder. In these cases, quitting both drugs and alcohol is necessary for successful recovery. \nAs for smoking cigarettes, while it is not strictly prohibited for recovering drug addicts, it is generally not recommended because smoking can also have negative health consequences and may be a trigger for drug or alcohol use.

They may also have backup plans in place, such as a safe place to go or a way to communicate with others if regular means of communication are disrupted. \nWhile it is true that the government is not likely to collapse anytime soon, disasters and emergencies can happen at any time and being prepared can help people cope with the challenges they may face.

This is because the skin under your eyes is thin and delicate, and it can become swollen or bruised when you don't get enough rest. \nThe dark circles under your eyes are caused by blood vessels that are visible through the skin. When you're tired, your body is working harder to keep you awake and alert, which can cause the blood vessels under your eyes to become more dilated (larger). This makes them more visible, which can create the appearance of dark circles. \nSo, in short, dark circles under your eyes are a sign that your body needs more rest and that you might be feeling tired.

However, your eyes are constantly producing tears, which helps to keep them moist and prevent them from drying out. These tears also contain substances that help to keep the surface of your eyes healthy and prevent them from freezing. \nAdditionally, the inside of your body is generally warmer than the outside air, so the water in your eyes is warmer than the air around you. This helps to prevent the water in your eyes from freezing, just like how it's harder to freeze a cup of water that is warmer than the air around it. \nFinally, the water in your eyes is constantly moving, which also helps to prevent it from freezing.

This can lead to dehydration because your body is losing more fluids than it is taking in. \nYour body needs a balance of fluids and electrolytes (like sodium and potassium) to function properly. When you drink too much salt water, the excess salt can cause your body's electrolyte balance to become imbalanced, which can lead to a condition called hyponatremia. \nSymptoms of hyponatremia include headache, nausea, vomiting, seizures, and in severe cases, coma and death. It's important to drink fluids that contain the right balance of electrolytes, such as water or sports drinks, to stay hydrated and healthy. \nIt's also important to note that drinking salt water is not a good way to hydrate your body. In fact, it can make your dehydration worse. If you are thirsty and need to hydrate your body, it's best to drink water or other beverages that are low in salt.",

    "question": "Why does my stereo always make noises before someone gets a text message or call in my room ? Yeah , it makes this weird series of quick beeps and then someone gets a call or text . Is my stereo psychic ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "When you receive a text , the network wo nt blindly send it to you . Instead , the network and your phone will first establish the connection , like this : \" Yo phone , you there ? \" \" Yea I 'm here \" \" Cool , I got a text for you , where are you ? \" \" * * I 'm here you stupid bitch * * \" \" Oh okay , I hear you at 6/10 . Setting power level to 4 . Here , take your text \" \" thanks \" It 's the shouting part you hear . Power conservation is very important on mobile networks , so the phones and the base stations will adjust their signal power to work optimally . When the phone is creating connection though , it will for a short time transmit at full power , and this is what causes the most interference in your devices .",

    "answer": "It's not that your stereo is psychic. It's likely that you have a phone or other device in your room that is connected to the same wireless network as your stereo, and the stereo is picking up a notification from the phone or device. \nWhen you get a call or text message, your phone sends a notification to the wireless network to let you know. The notification is a signal that is broadcast over the network and can be picked up by any device that is connected to the same network. \nIn this case, it sounds like your stereo is picking up the notification and playing the beeping sound as a result. It's not necessarily intentional or designed to happen this way, but it's just a side effect of how the devices are connected and how they communicate with each other.",

    "answer": "When you're awake and sitting or lying down, your body uses various senses to help you stay balanced and keep from falling off the bed. These senses include your sense of touch, your sense of sight, and your sense of balance. \nBut when you're asleep, your body is still using these senses to help you stay on the bed, even if you're not consciously aware of it. For example, if you start to roll off the bed, your body might automatically move to try to stay on the bed. This is because your body has learned to recognize the sensation of falling, and it knows that it needs to take action to prevent it from happening. \nSo even though you're asleep, your body is still working to keep you safe and comfortable. It's just that you're not consciously aware of it because you're sleeping.",

However, the Moon is not as suitable for human habitation as Mars is. The Moon has no atmosphere, which means that there is no air to breathe and no protection from the harsh radiation of the Sun. It also gets very cold at night and very hot during the day, and there is no water on the Moon. Mars, on the other hand, has an atmosphere, water ice, and a much more moderate temperature range, which makes it a better place for people to live.

    "question": "What is the purpose of a water tower ? Backup storage ? Pressure management ? Hopefully a public works person can explain ... Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "A water tower is a tall, cylindrical tank that is used to store water. It is usually found in areas where the water pressure in the local water pipes is not strong enough to deliver water to buildings and homes. \nThe water tower helps to solve this problem by storing a large amount of water at a higher elevation than the buildings and homes. This allows the water to flow downward, through the pipes, and into the buildings and homes under the force of gravity. This is called \"gravity feed.\" \nWater towers also help to maintain a consistent water pressure in the pipes. When a lot of water is being used at the same time (for example, when people are taking showers or flushing toilets), the water pressure can drop. Having a water tower helps to ensure that there is always a reserve of water available to meet the demand, so the water pressure stays stable. \nIn summary, water towers are used to store water and to help with the delivery of water to buildings and homes, as well as to maintain a consistent water pressure in the pipes.",

    "answer": "One 30% alcohol beverage is stronger than three 10% alcohol beverages because it has more alcohol in it. Alcohol is a type of drug that can affect your body and mind. When you drink alcohol, it can make you feel relaxed or dizzy. \nIt's important to remember that it's not safe to drink too much alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can be harmful to your health and can even be deadly. This is because alcohol can affect the way your body and brain work. It can make you feel sick, and it can also cause you to lose control of your actions. \nIt's also important to remember that it's not safe to drink any alcohol if you are under the age of 21. This is because young people's brains are still developing, and alcohol can cause permanent damage. \nAs for the 100% alcoholic beverage, it's poisonous because it contains a very high concentration of alcohol. When you drink a lot of alcohol at once, your body can't handle it and it can be very dangerous. This is why it's important to drink alcohol in moderation and to never drink too much at once.",

    "answer": "London Heathrow Airport has two main runways, which are used to take off and land planes. The airport is very busy, with many planes coming and going every day. To make sure everything runs smoothly and safely, the airport has a carefully planned system for when and where planes can take off and land. \nWhen a plane is ready to take off, it will line up on the runway and wait for permission to go. When it is safe for the plane to take off, the airport control tower will give it permission to do so. The plane will then accelerate down the runway and lift off into the air. \nWhen a plane is ready to land, it will approach the airport and line up with one of the runways. The control tower will give the plane permission to land, and the pilot will bring the plane down gently onto the runway. \nAlthough London Heathrow only has two main runways, it has a number of other smaller runways that can also be used if needed. This helps to keep the airport running efficiently and safely, even when it is very busy. \nI hope this helps to explain how London Heathrow can operate with just two main runways!

    "answer": "It is theoretically possible to create a program that deletes itself and any evidence of its existence, but it would be very difficult to do so in a way that is completely foolproof and can't be traced. \nWhen a program runs on a computer, it leaves behind various types of evidence, such as files on the hard drive, entries in the operating system's log files, and even changes to the state of the computer's memory. A program that tries to delete itself would have to take all of these things into account and find a way to erase them. \nOne way to do this might be to create a program that runs in a loop, constantly checking for any evidence of its own existence and deleting it as it is found. However, this would be very difficult to do perfectly, and there is always the possibility that some evidence could be missed or that the program could malfunction in some way and leave behind a clue. \nIn addition, even if a program could successfully delete itself and all evidence of its existence, it is likely that someone could still potentially reconstruct the program or its actions by examining the state of the computer before and after the program ran. \nOverall, while it is possible to create a program that tries to delete itself and any evidence of its existence, it would be very difficult to do so in a way that is completely foolproof and cannot be traced.",

These vibrations can be picked up by the inner ear, which is responsible for detecting sound and helping us to hear. The inner ear is made up of tiny sensors called hair cells that detect the movement of the bones in our head and send signals to the brain, which interprets these signals as sound.

    "answer": "TV shows are generally a certain length because it's a convenient amount of time for the people who make and watch the show. 30-minute sitcoms (which is short for \"situation comedies\") are usually shorter because they are meant to be funny and lighthearted. 60-minute dramas are usually longer because they often have more complex storylines and deal with heavier subject matter. \nThere have been a few 60-minute comedies, but they are not very common. One example is the show \"Arrested Development,\" which aired on FOX from 2003 to 2006 and then on Netflix from 2013 to 2018. This show was a bit longer than most sitcoms, but it still followed the same basic format of telling funny stories with characters who have wacky problems and conflicts. \nIn general, though, most TV shows are either 30 minutes or 60 minutes long because those lengths work well for the kind of stories that the show is trying to tell.",

    "answer": "Catnip is a plant that has a chemical in it called nepetalactone that can affect cats in a way that is similar to how humans might feel after taking drugs or alcohol. When a cat smells or ingests catnip, it can cause them to become more playful, energetic, and sometimes even a little bit frisky. Some cats may become more relaxed or calm after interacting with catnip. \nThe effects of catnip usually only last for a short amount of time, usually around 10-15 minutes. After that, the cat will likely lose interest in the catnip and may even become indifferent to it for a while. This is because their body becomes temporarily \"immune\" to the effects of the catnip. \nIt's important to note that not all cats are affected by catnip. Some cats may show no interest in it at all, while others may be very sensitive to it.

    "answer": "Soap operas are instantly identifiable for a few reasons. One reason is that they often have a specific visual style. Soap operas tend to use close-up shots of actors' faces to show emotions and reactions, and they often have dramatic or romantic music playing in the background. This helps create a sense of drama and tension. \nAnother reason is that soap operas tend to have a specific type of storytelling. Soap operas are known for having long, ongoing storylines that unfold over the course of many episodes or even years. They often feature a large cast of characters who are interconnected and have complicated relationships with each other. This can make it easy to recognize a soap opera even if you haven't seen it before. \nFinally, soap operas are often identified by their genre. Soap operas are a type of drama that focuses on the personal and professional lives of characters who are usually in their 20s to 40s and are often upper-middle class or wealthy. This can make them stand out from other types of television shows, which might focus on different characters or topics.",

When someone is addicted to heroin, they may feel like they need to use the drug in order to feel normal or to avoid feeling sick. They may also experience strong cravings for the drug, and they may continue to use it even if it is causing problems in their relationships or at work. \nIn summary, it is normal and healthy to want water to stay hydrated, but addiction is a more serious issue that involves a dependence on a substance or activity, and it can have negative consequences on a person's life.",

    "answer": "It's not just you! Many people have experienced this phenomenon, and it's actually a pretty common thing. \nThe bladder is a muscle that stores urine until it's time to go to the bathroom. When it gets full, it sends a signal to your brain that it's time to find a bathroom and pee. But your brain can also receive other signals that might override this \"I need to pee\" signal. For example, if you're really focused on something, you might be able to ignore the feeling of needing to go to the bathroom for a little while. \nHowever, once you know that there's a bathroom nearby, your brain might start paying more attention to the \"I need to pee\" signal. This can make it harder to hold it in, even if you were able to before. So when you're near a bathroom and you really need to go, it might be harder to hold it in than when you're not near a bathroom and the signal to go is weaker. \nI hope that helps!

Basically , the retailers have to sign a contract that says they ca n't advertise the product below a certain price . Manufacturer 's do this to ensure that their products sell at a certain price . It 's particularly important for manufacturer 's who also do retail , like Apple . Apple wants to sell iPhones in its stores for a certain price and wants other stores to sell iPhones as well , but not at a lower price . However , this only affects the advertised price . You can still sell the item for less as long as you do n't advertise the lower price . When you click the item to put it in your cart , you can see the price because it 's not longer an advertised price ; it 's the price you 're about the be charged .",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why some websites might hide the price of a product until it is added to the cart: \n1. To encourage customers to add more items to their cart: By hiding the price until the item is added to the cart, the website may be trying to encourage customers to add more items to their cart before they see the total cost. This can be especially effective if the website offers discounts for larger orders. \n2. To reduce comparison shopping: By hiding the price until the item is added to the cart, the website may be trying to make it more difficult for customers to compare the price of the product with prices offered by other websites. This can be especially effective if the website has a unique or hard-to-find product that is not available elsewhere. \n3. To create a sense of exclusivity: Some websites may hide the price of a product until it is added to the cart as a way of creating a sense of exclusivity or scarcity. This can make customers feel like they are getting a special deal or that the product is in high demand. \n4. To reduce distractions: Some websites may hide the price of a product until it is added to the cart in order to reduce distractions or distractions for the customer. This can be especially effective if the website has a lot of products and wants to focus the customer's attention on a specific product. \nI hope this helps!

    "question": "Why is the Mona Lisa considered such an artistic masterpiece ? I understand that to anyone even remotely knowledgeable of art it must have all sorts of artistic value to it , but to me .... it 's just a painting of a woman .... help ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "It essentially is just a painting of a woman , a very good painting of a woman . Obviously this does n't do it justice , it is like saying \" David \" is just a statue of a man or \" The Creation of Adam \" is a nice ceiling decoration . The expertise and genius of Da Vinci can be seen in the painting , it is just a really really good painting , bordering on perfect for the style of painting . Things like the facial expression were novel for the time it was painted , and the background has a lot of things going on , it is just a really nice painting . Now , why is it so famous ? Multiple reasons . One , the Renaissance was a big deal historically . It was for a long time seen as the awakening of humanity from the Dark Ages . A time of genius and art . This is not true for all of humanity , the Middle East and Asia were doing just fine during the \" Dark Ages \" but this misconception makes for the Renaissance being very important historically . Da Vinci is a well known Renaissance artist . He was just a bad ass , he was a great painter , an inventor , just an interesting person so his reputation makes his art valuable on it 's own . The Mona Lisa in particular is valuable because in 1911 it was stolen , it became worldwide news and suddenly the Mona Lisa was the most famous painting in the world . This popularity has just sort of stuck to the painting . There has to be one painting which is the most popular , it is the way of things , something has to be on top and the Mona Lisa just so happened to become that painting .",

    "answer": "The Mona Lisa is considered a masterpiece of Renaissance art because of the skill and technique used by the artist, Leonardo da Vinci, to create the painting. The Mona Lisa is a portrait of a woman and is known for the enigmatic smile on her face, which is one of the reasons it is so famous. \nOne of the things that makes the Mona Lisa so special is the way Leonardo painted the woman's face and expression. He used a technique called sfumato, which involves blending the colors and tones of the paint so that there are no hard edges or lines. This gives the painting a very soft and natural look, as if the woman is almost alive. \nAnother reason the Mona Lisa is so highly regarded is because of the detail and care that Leonardo put into the painting. He spent many years working on the Mona Lisa, and it shows in the level of detail in the painting. From the folds of the woman's dress to the landscape in the background, everything is carefully and beautifully rendered. \nOverall, the Mona Lisa is considered a masterpiece because of the skill and attention to detail that Leonardo put into the painting, as well as the way he used color and technique to create a sense of depth and realism. It is a beautiful and timeless work of art that has inspired and delighted people for centuries.",

For most people , the lion 's share of their income taxes are paid through mandatory paycheck deductions . So , in order for everyone to stop paying income taxes completely , everyone would have to quit their jobs . But if you 're talking about filing taxes and paying any additional owed , then the IRS would get civil judgements against everyone who did n't pay , and those would likely result in garnishments .

    "answer": "The income tax is a tax that the government imposes on the income that individuals and businesses earn. It is an important source of revenue for the government, and it helps to fund many of the programs and services that the government provides, such as national defense, education, healthcare, and infrastructure. \nIf everyone in the United States stopped paying income tax, the government would not have enough money to fund these programs and services. This could lead to significant problems, such as a lack of resources for the military to protect the country, a decline in the quality of education and healthcare, and a lack of investment in infrastructure. \nIt's important to note that the income tax is not voluntary. It is a legal requirement, and people are required to pay it unless they qualify for an exemption or meet certain other criteria. The government has the power to enforce the payment of income tax through various means, such as garnishing wages or seizing property. \nIt is also worth noting that the income tax has been ratified. The 16th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which was ratified in 1913, gives the government the authority to levy an income tax.",

    "answer": "When an animal is preparing to jump, it is using its muscles and senses to gauge the distance and effort needed to successfully reach its target. Sometimes, the animal may miscalculate the distance or the effort needed, which can result in a jump that does not cover as much distance as the animal had intended. \nFor example, if an animal is trying to jump to a branch that is farther away than it thought, it may not have enough strength or momentum to reach the branch and will fall short. Alternatively, if the animal is trying to jump to a branch that is closer than it thought, it may overcompensate and jump too far, causing it to miss the branch altogether. \nOverall, animals may struggle to jump long distances if they do not accurately judge the distance or effort needed, just like how a person might struggle to jump over a puddle if they misjudge the size of the puddle.",

    "answer": "Herbivores like wild horses can acquire a lot of muscle mass by eating a lot of grass because grass contains a good amount of nutrients that the body needs to grow and maintain muscle mass. These nutrients include proteins, which are important for building and repairing muscle tissue, and carbohydrates, which provide the body with energy to support physical activity. \nIt is possible for a vegan human to maintain high muscle mass by eating a varied and balanced diet that includes a good source of plant-based proteins and carbohydrates. Some examples of plant-based proteins that can help build and maintain muscle mass include beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh, nuts, and seeds. It is also important for vegans to make sure they are getting enough calories and nutrients from other sources, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, to support muscle growth and maintenance. \nHowever, it is generally easier for people who eat animal products, such as meat, eggs, and dairy, to get enough protein and other nutrients to support muscle mass because these sources of protein are typically more easily digestible and contain a more complete set of amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein. This does not mean that it is impossible for vegans to maintain high muscle mass, but it may require more careful planning and attention to nutrition.",

    "answer": "The phrase \"Am I being detained, officer?\" is a common one that people use when interacting with law enforcement officers in the United States. It is a way for people to ask whether they are being held against their will by the police, or if they are free to leave. This phrase has become more commonly used in recent years as people have become more aware of their rights when interacting with law enforcement. \nThe phrase \"Am I being detained, officer?\" is not necessarily a bad thing to say to a police officer. In fact, it is often seen as a way for people to assert their rights and to ensure that they are not being detained without cause. \nThere is a legal precedent for this phrase in the United States. The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects people from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government. This means that law enforcement officers must have a valid reason, or \"probable cause,\" to detain someone. If an officer does not have probable cause to detain someone, the person has the right to ask if they are being detained and to ask for the reason for the detention. If the officer does not have a valid reason, the person is usually free to leave. \nIt is important to note that while the phrase \"Am I being detained, officer?\" is a way for people to assert their rights and ensure that they are not being detained without cause, it is not a guarantee that a person will be allowed to leave if they are being detained. It is always a good idea to cooperate with law enforcement officers, even if you believe that your rights are being violated. If you feel that your rights have been violated, you can seek legal advice or file a complaint with the appropriate authorities.",

    "question": "Why do traffic lights have three lights instead of one light that changes color ? Edit : Sorry colorblind people . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Traffic lights have three lights because they are used to control the flow of traffic at intersections. Red, yellow, and green are the three colors that are used in traffic lights because they are easy for people to recognize and understand. Red means \"stop,\" yellow means \"caution,\" and green means \"go.\" \nHaving three lights allows traffic to be controlled in all directions. If there was just one light that changed color, it would be more confusing for people to know when it was safe to cross the intersection. For example, if the light was red, people would not know if they should stop because the light is red in all directions, or if they should go because the light is green in the opposite direction. \nBy using three lights, traffic can be controlled more efficiently and safely. When the red light is on, all traffic must stop. When the yellow light is on, traffic should slow down and be prepared to stop. When the green light is on, traffic can proceed through the intersection. This helps to prevent accidents and keeps traffic moving smoothly.",

Edit : To clarify , why is piracy considered okay by the internet community at large ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Piracy is n't ok , but it is a consequence of marketing and pricing . There is no justifying it , but there is some explanation of it . With saturation advertising , there 's literally almost no direction I can look , right now , where I 'm sitting , and not see an advertisement for digital media . The whole point is the advertisers want you to feel that you want this product and you want it * now * , in order to induce a purchase . And they 're successful , at large , too successful , actually . The value of media is inflated , music and video is n't actually worth what they 're charging , as evidenced by the rampant piracy . The working class has n't had a pay raise in 22 years and has less buying power now than they did in the 1980s , cost of living increases , and the price of media has always been ~$15 for an album . And you get less today than ever . You used to get a cover , an insert , and art , bundled with the album . Today , you get an mp3 download . It costs fractions of a penny to digitize the final product and distribute it on the internet , you 'd think that would drop the price . It costs $ 0.017 to produce a CD , just as a point of reference , and digital distribution is orders of magnitude cheaper . So here you have a market who wants your product and wants it now , and ca n't or wo n't afford it . I 'm not saying it 's ok , but this is the catalyst that allows people to justify it . The way the industry works is an artist is contracted to produce content for the publisher , they do n't own their own songs , and they 're literally lucky if they get any money , at all , from the sale of their media . Artists make money by performing , and even then , they 're responsible for the cost of the production , which cuts into their profits . So publishers are seen as big , bad , rich , faceless corporations - profiteering gluttons who do n't need any more money for something they own but they did n't make , so fuck em ' , right ? The world is such a big place and so many people do buy the album that they wo n't even notice I stole a copy ... Or so the mindset goes . There are scenarios where people do pay , when they feel the price is fair and when they feel the profits are distributed to those whom they see entitled .",

Edit : To clarify , why is piracy considered okay by the internet community at large ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Piracy and copyright law can be contentious issues on the internet because they involve complex questions about how to balance the rights of creators and the interests of consumers. Some people argue that artists should have the right to control how their works are distributed and to charge what they feel is appropriate, while others believe that the free exchange of information is important and that artists should not be able to control how their works are used. \nIt's important to remember that copyright law exists to protect the rights of creators and to encourage the creation of new works by ensuring that artists can earn a fair income from their creations. When someone pirates (unauthorized copying) or uses a copyrighted work without permission, they are taking something that belongs to someone else and using it for their own benefit, without paying the person who created it. This can be seen as unfair to the creator and can discourage them from creating new works in the future. \nAt the same time, it's also important to recognize that not everyone has the same access to information and that copyright laws can sometimes make it difficult or impossible for people to access the works they want to use. This is why it's important to have a balance between protecting the rights of creators and ensuring that everyone has access to the information and works they need.",

    "answer": "Water from the tap in your bathroom may taste different from water from other taps in your home for a few reasons. \nFirst, the water in your home may come from different sources, such as a well or a municipal water treatment plant. The water from these sources can have different mineral content, which can affect the taste. \nSecond, the pipes that carry water to different parts of your home may be made of different materials, such as copper or PVC. These materials can give the water a slightly different taste. \nFinally, the water in your bathroom tap may have been sitting in the pipes for a longer time than water from other taps, which can also affect the taste. \nOverall, the taste of water from different taps in your home may vary slightly due to a combination of these factors.

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why individuals involved in the CIA's torture program have not been charged in international court for crimes against humanity. \nFirst, it is important to note that the United States is not a party to the International Criminal Court (ICC), which is the main international tribunal that prosecutes crimes against humanity. This means that the ICC does not have jurisdiction over individuals in the United States, and cannot bring criminal charges against them. \nSecond, even if the United States were a party to the ICC, it is generally difficult to prosecute individuals for crimes against humanity. These crimes are typically committed on a large scale, such as during armed conflicts or genocides, and require evidence of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population. Proving that an individual was directly responsible for such crimes can be challenging, especially when there are many people involved and the events in question took place over a long period of time. \nFinally, it is also worth noting that the United States has its own legal system and processes for holding individuals accountable for their actions. While it is true that the Obama Administration chose not to pursue criminal charges against individuals involved in the CIA's torture program, this decision was made in part because the Department of Justice had already investigated the matter and determined that there was not enough evidence to bring criminal charges.",

    "answer": "It is a theoretical model , that has been proven through experiment . Imagine someone gives you a gift . It is a hollow metal sphere but it is packaged in a box . You have no idea what the gift is , but decide to do some experiments to find out , without actually opening the box . First you shake the box and it moves around . This tells you it is relatively light . Then , knowing that it is light , you move it slowly and you feel it rolling . This tells you that it is probably round . Now you are trying to find out what it is made of . You apply heat to the box , then shake to see if it has melted but it has not . You suspect that it is a strong but light material , like a metal alloy - since initial shake tests did n't break it ca n't be brittle . So you decide to touch magnets to the surface of the box . The object does not move and stays attracted to the magnet . This tells you it is metallic . Since it is metallic and relatively light , you suspect , it is hollow . So , you poke a hole in the box , and fill it with water . Comparing the volume of the box , with the volume of water you filled will tell you the size of the object . From this , you can choose a metal - alloy based on the magnetic strength recorded and estimate how hollow it is . All this has been concluded , without actually seeing the sphere . Still , you can only speculate what colour the sphere is or whether it has dimples or not . But from the tests you carried out , you can pretty much acknowledge certain findings as fact . That 's sort of the process people like Rutherford used to determine the atomic model . As for being able to see it , I do n't think so . We have two types of microscope - Light microscope and Electron microscope . LM uses lightwaves ( duh ) and so objects too small to interfere with these waves can not be seen . EM uses electrons ( of course ) , which which are very tiny , and they bounce back of the object at different angles to give us awesome 3d images . I do n't need to tell you what would happen if we tried to fire electrons at an atom ... but that 's beside the point . The Rutherford experiments already did that , and it told us that materials are mostly empty space and there is much distance between the nucleus and an electron . So , you ca n't see the \" model \" of the atom , but you can see individual atoms using an TEM transmission electron microscope iirc .",

Another way is through the use of instruments called microscopes, which use light or other forms of radiation to magnify small objects so we can see them more clearly. \nWe also use other tools, such as particle accelerators, to study atoms. These devices speed up tiny particles, such as electrons, and then collide them with other particles. By studying the behavior of these particles, we can learn more about the structure of atoms. \nSo while we cannot see atoms directly, we can use a variety of tools to study them and learn about their structure.

    "question": "The US ' beef with its cops I just want a little light on what 's happening with u guys like , why are your cops brutalizing and sometimes even killing the citizens they were sworn to protect ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "I'm sorry to hear that you are concerned about the actions of some law enforcement officers in the United States. It is important to note that the vast majority of police officers in the US are dedicated public servants who work hard to protect and serve their communities. However, there have been instances of police officers using excessive force, or behaving in ways that are not in line with their training or the values of their profession. \nThere are many factors that can contribute to instances of police violence or misconduct. These may include inadequate training, a lack of oversight or accountability, and a culture within some police departments that tolerates or even encourages aggressive or inappropriate behavior. There may also be systemic issues, such as discrimination and bias, that contribute to the mistreatment of certain groups by law enforcement. \nIt is important for law enforcement agencies and communities to work together to address these issues and ensure that police officers are held accountable for their actions. This can include things like better training and oversight, stronger policies and procedures, and stronger relationships between police and the communities they serve.",

    "question": "what 's the difference between a dual core processor that runs at 4 GHz and a 6 core processor that runs at 4GHz ? Is the performance the same , or is the 6 core going to be significantly better ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Depends on the software really . A 4ghz dual core and 6 core both run at the same frequency or clock cycle but may not have the same architecture which is actually more important for performance then raw clock speed . For your question though lets assume the architecture is the same and just the amount of cores is different . In hypothetical situation it depends really on How the software was designed . If it was designed to take advantage of 6 whole cores then it will likely perform much better on a 6 core processor than a dual but even today most programs are n't designed to use that many cores effectively . If a program at most only uses 2 of threads or cpu cores then you wo nt really see a benefit from having those extra cores .",

    "question": "what 's the difference between a dual core processor that runs at 4 GHz and a 6 core processor that runs at 4GHz ? Is the performance the same , or is the 6 core going to be significantly better ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "A dual core processor has two cores, while a 6-core processor has six cores. The cores are essentially small processors within the main processor (CPU) that allow it to perform multiple tasks at once. \nThe clock speed, measured in GHz, refers to how fast the processor can perform tasks. A processor with a higher clock speed will generally be able to perform tasks faster than a processor with a lower clock speed. \nSo, a dual-core processor that runs at 4 GHz and a 6-core processor that runs at 4 GHz will have different performance capabilities. The 6-core processor will generally be able to perform tasks faster and more efficiently than the dual-core processor, because it has more cores that can work on different tasks at the same time. \nFor example, if you are running multiple programs on your computer at the same time, the 6-core processor will be able to split the work among its cores and complete the tasks faster than the dual-core processor, which can only work on one task at a time. \nI hope that helps!

    "question": "Why does NASA launch spacecraft from Florida when it has some of the stormiest weather in North America ? It seems every time there is a major launch it get delayed time and again ! Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Well anywhere you go in the country you have weather issues , if it 's the Midwest you 'll have tornadoes . Do it in the South and you get hurricanes . Do it in the Southwest and you 'll probably have a lot of sand related delays ( i.e. desert storms ) . But one of the main reasons it was picked was because of safety . If a rocket or shuttle was to explode mid air after takeoff the debris and what not would sprinkle over the ocean , away from land and population centers . Launches always go eastward . When you launch headed east , you gain the rotation of the Earth in terms of acceleration . And so you do n't have to have quite as powerful a rocket . Also , when the Cape Canaveral Space station was first established it was pretty desolate just marshes and farms . It 's also close to key navy and air force bases . The area they built on also offered good supply routes unlike the Soviets who when they built their launch areas out in Kazakhstan had to strain themselves to build infrastructure .

    "question": "Why does NASA launch spacecraft from Florida when it has some of the stormiest weather in North America ? It seems every time there is a major launch it get delayed time and again ! Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "NASA launches spacecraft from Florida for a few different reasons. One reason is that Florida is close to the equator, which means that the Earth's rotation can give a boost to the spacecraft as it is launched into space. This can save fuel and make it easier for the spacecraft to reach its destination. \nAnother reason is that NASA has a lot of experience launching spacecraft from Florida. They have been doing it for many years, and they have a lot of infrastructure in place to support launches, including launch pads, control centers, and support facilities. \nFinally, NASA launches spacecraft from Florida because it is close to the Kennedy Space Center, which is a large complex of facilities that are used to design, test, and launch spacecraft. The Kennedy Space Center is located on the east coast of Florida, which makes it easier for NASA to launch spacecraft that are going to travel eastward, such as spacecraft that are going to the International Space Station. \nIt's true that Florida can have stormy weather, and this can sometimes cause delays in launches. However, NASA has a lot of experience launching spacecraft in all kinds of weather conditions, and they have developed technologies and procedures to ensure the safety of the spacecraft and the people who are working on the launch.",

    "answer": "Tilting your rearview mirror up at night allows you to see a dimmer version of what's behind you because the mirror is designed to reflect light from the rear of your vehicle. When you tilt the mirror up, the light from the headlights of the vehicles behind you is reflected off the mirror and into your eyes. This can be helpful at night because it allows you to see what's behind you without being blinded by the bright headlights. \nThe mirror is not just tilting up to hit the ceiling inside your car. It is still reflecting light, just at a different angle. When you tilt the mirror up, you are changing the angle at which the light is reflected off the mirror and into your eyes. This change in angle causes the light to appear dimmer, which can make it easier to see what's behind you at night.",

    "answer": "Space shuttles and other rockets do not use nuclear energy as a fuel source because there are several practical and technical challenges associated with using nuclear energy for space travel. \nOne challenge is that nuclear energy is difficult to store and transport. Nuclear fuel is heavy and bulky, which makes it difficult to fit into the small, lightweight rocket designs that are needed for space travel. In addition, nuclear fuel can be dangerous to handle and requires special precautions to ensure that it is safe. \nAnother challenge is that it is difficult to control the release of energy from nuclear reactions. In a rocket, it is important to be able to control the amount of energy that is released in order to propel the spacecraft at the right speed and direction. With nuclear energy, it can be difficult to accurately control the amount of energy that is released, which can make it difficult to use as a fuel source for space travel. \nFinally, there are also concerns about the environmental impact of using nuclear energy for space travel. Nuclear reactions can produce radioactive waste, which would need to be carefully disposed of in order to protect the environment. \nOverall, while nuclear energy has the potential to be a very efficient and powerful fuel source, the practical and technical challenges associated with using it for space travel make it less suitable for use in rockets and other spacecraft.",

    "answer": "Sure! Gases like helium are collected and put into containers in a process called gas collecting. Here's how it works: \n1. First, helium gas is found in the Earth's crust, often in natural gas deposits. \n2. To collect the gas, workers drill into the ground to find the natural gas deposits and extract the gas using special equipment. \n3. Once the gas is extracted, it is purified to remove any impurities or contaminants. \n4. Next, the purified gas is put into a special container called a \"gas cylinder\" or \"gas tank.\" These containers are made of metal and are designed to hold gases safely. \n5. The gas is then sealed inside the container using a special valve or other closing mechanism. \nThat's it! Now the gas is ready to be used or transported to where it is needed. Hope that helps!

    "question": "Why do online videos stream flawlessly on my computer but why do GIFs seem to load like a 1080p movie through a 56k modem ? ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "tl;dr : GIF is an image compression format , which is n't really suited well to compressing video data . Basically the only advantage is that browsers support the format natively without loading plugins . Actual videos compressed with video encoders are way more efficient . --- In an animated GIF , each frame of the animation is encoded as a separate file , and then the files are more or less just stuck together in the final animation . You can do something similar with JPEG ( Motion JPEG ) , although it 's not supported by browsers in quite the same way as GIFs . Also GIFs do a better job of compressing line art rather than photographs . Thus , making a video out of GIF images yields pretty poor compression anyhow . In an encoded video file , the video compressor takes into account that successive frames are ( probably ) related to each other . The first frame is encoded completely , in a similar ( but more advanced ) method as a JPEG might be . However , the next frame is typically encoded as just the difference from the first frame to the second . This is way more efficient for most videos where motion happens slowly . Say the video is of a ball falling . In an animated GIF , each frame is a standalone , complete picture of the ball and any surroundings . It 's compressed rather poorly , and a lot of redundant information is sent , so each individual frame is very large . In a video encoded with a video codec ( MPEG1 , MPEG2 , MPEG4 , h.264 , h,265 , etc ) , the first frame is compressed somewhat similarly to a JPEG . Then the second frame basically says \" see the region of the first frame where the ball is ? Move that down a bit . Fill in the background with this information . \" - This frame is * way * smaller and easier to transmit than the first frame . It 's also easier and faster to decode . There are some drawbacks to the video compression approach , but in general it does a way better job of representing the video data with way fewer bits . --- EDIT : Wow , this is getting a lot of attention :) I left out a lot of stuff to keep the answer simple , but I 'm getting pinged about a lot of the same things over and over , so here 's a few quick additions : - Yes , compression algorithm differences matter as well . I said something to this effect , but to extend : GIF uses a compression method that works well for color patterns , and video encoders use something that works better for photographs / live video . I did n't try to explain DCT / Quantization / entropy coding since that 's a super technical topic for ELI5 . - Yes , GIF can represent a simple delta between two frames . However , in the case of video data , it is rare that this is useful . Someone asked for a more detailed explanation of this , [ my response is here ] ( URL_1 ) . - Yes , there may be other factors at work besides the bitrate / coding issues . I think it is safe to say that GIF is a terrible video compression format , and that 's probably the root of many other issues . However , I have n't profiled browsers to see where they spend time decoding animated GIFs . I made a list of other places that could be inefficient [ here ] ( URL_0 ) . - Yeah , your \" five year old did n't understand this \" el - oh - el :P If my 7 - yr - old had the interest I 'd try to explain it to him and get his feedback , but I think he 'd rather play LEGO . --- EDIT 2 : A couple more things people are asking / mentioning : - Several people have mentioned HTML5 Video and WebM as alternatives to animated GIFs . There 's a lot of back - and - forth , legal issues , competitors refusing to agree and so forth that is really hampering the HTML5 video tag . [ Wikipedia has a long article on the subject . ] ( URL_2 ) We 've had better video technology than GIF for years and GIF is still going strong . I think we 're stuck with it , despite it being a terrible technology for the problem . ( See also : practically every other technology used on the web ) - A common question is \" So does this mean that simpler videos with less movement will be encoded to smaller file sizes ? Or that complex or really random videos make larger or less efficient video files ? \" The answer to this somewhat depends on the encoder settings , but in general the answer is yes . If you encode a simple video with little motion it will take less data than a more complex video with a lot of motion and random stuff going on . Modern video encoders are tuned towards encoding video sequences from cameras . They make assumptions based on what the real world looks like most of the time , and use those assumptions to compress more efficiently . They also take into account what our eyes are good at seeing .",

    "answer": "Online videos and GIFs are two different types of media that are loaded and played differently on your computer. \nVideos are usually streamed from a server to your computer, which means that your computer receives small pieces of the video at a time, and it plays them one after the other. This allows you to start watching the video almost immediately, even if the entire video has not yet been downloaded to your computer. \nGIFs, on the other hand, are usually loaded all at once, just like a regular image. This means that if the GIF is large or has a lot of frames (the \"pictures\" that make up the GIF), it can take longer to load. \nSo, the reason why videos stream smoothly on your computer and GIFs might seem to load slowly is because of the way they are loaded and played. Videos are streamed in small pieces, while GIFs are loaded all at once.",

    "answer": "Italy was one of the major Axis powers during World War II, along with Germany and Japan. However, Italy's role in the war was not as significant as Germany's or Japan's. Germany was the main driving force behind the war and was responsible for many of the most heinous crimes committed during the conflict, such as the Holocaust, which resulted in the extermination of millions of Jews and other minority groups. Japan, on the other hand, was responsible for numerous war crimes in Asia, including the Nanjing Massacre, in which hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians were killed. \nAs a result, Germany and Japan have received more infamy and condemnation for their actions during the war. Italy, while it did participate in the war and committed its own crimes, has not received the same level of notoriety as these other two countries. \nIt's also important to note that after the war, both Germany and Japan underwent significant changes and have since become strong democratic countries. Italy, on the other hand, has had a tumultuous history since the war and has not undergone the same level of transformation. This may also contribute to the difference in the way the three countries are perceived in terms of their roles in World War II.",

    "answer": "The first wealthy humans likely became wealthy through a combination of luck, hard work, and being in the right place at the right time. For example, let's say that one of the first 1000 modern humans discovered a new source of food, like a field full of ripe berries or a river full of fish. This person might have been able to gather more food than they needed, and they could have traded or sold the excess to other people in exchange for things they needed or wanted. \nOver time, this person might have become known as someone who had a lot of food, and others might have wanted to trade with them or work for them in order to get some of that food. This could have given the person more resources, which they could have used to do things like buy tools or hire others to work for them. \nAnother way that someone might have become wealthy was by inventing or discovering something new that was valuable to others. For example, if someone invented a new tool or technique that made it easier to hunt or gather food, they might have been able to trade or sell that invention to others in exchange for resources. \nUltimately, there are many factors that could have contributed to the first wealthy humans becoming wealthy, and it likely varied from person to person.

    "answer": "Heart attacks are usually caused by something, but they can happen randomly in some cases. A heart attack occurs when the blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked. This can be caused by a blockage in one of the blood vessels that supplies blood to the heart. The blockage is usually caused by a buildup of plaque, a substance made up of fat, cholesterol, and other substances in the blood. Plaque can build up in the blood vessels over time and can eventually rupture, causing a blood clot to form. If the blood clot is large enough, it can block the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack. \nIn some cases, heart attacks can be brought on by other factors, such as high blood pressure, smoking, or stress. However, they can also happen randomly, even in people who do not have any known risk factors for heart disease. \nIt is also possible for people to have more than one heart attack. After a heart attack, it is important to work with a healthcare provider to make lifestyle changes and take medications as prescribed to lower the risk of having another heart attack.",

    "answer": "There are multiple kinds . The alcohol - based gels work by ruining the bacteria 's cell walls ; alcohol in high concentration is very lethal to nearly all bacteria . The outer layer of human skin is already dead , and a lot more resistant to being penetrated by alcohol ; the 30 seconds or so that you 're rubbing your hands is n't enough to get through that ( relatively ) thick layer of protein and other dead - cell bits . But if you get hand sanitizer into a small cut it will touch unprotected , living tissues and sting . It also strips your skin of some of its natural oils , which is why the hand gels usually have moisturizers in them . Related : Your stomach , and to some extent other parts of the digestive tract , is already protected against * some * chemicals because it 's such a strongly acidic environment anyway and it takes rapid cell replacement and a mucus layer to keep the acid from harming you . This also reduces damage from alcohol , though alcohol is still poison . Ethanol , the kind in liquor and beer , is a poison too , but mild to humans in very low concentrations and we 've evolved to be able to consume small amounts . It 's naturally present in fermenting fruit etc . anyway like we would have encountered in the wild . If you drink a human - potable form of alcohol ( say , vodka , which is usually 35 - 50 % ethanol ) the most it 'll do to your stomach , if you do n't overdo it , is irritate the lining ; stomachs are tough . Then it 's diluted heavily in your bloodstream . But if you wash a countertop with that plain vodka , it 'll kill a lot of bacteria ; it hits them full - strength and they do n't have protective layers . The soaps with a small amount of an antibacterial topical drug in them , instead of alcohol , are similar . They 're toxic to bacteria , but do n't really penetrate the thicker , non - living human skin layer . The amount of exposure you get just from washing your hands , even if you have a few little cuts , is n't enough to do anything bad to you .",

Our cells have a stronger and more complex cell membrane that is more resistant to the ingredients in antibacterial hand gels and soaps. In addition, our cells also have other protective mechanisms in place that help them repair and defend against damage. \nIt's important to note that while antibacterial hand gels and soaps can be effective at killing bacteria on our skin, they may not necessarily kill all types of bacteria.

    "answer": "Key Existential Concepts The meaninglessness of life , the absence of God , the loneliness of being a thinking individual \u2014 it sounds like the existentialists were n't the happiest group of folks , right ? Not necessarily true . Read on to get an idea of what existentialism is all about . Absurdity : What human beings encounter when they come into contact with the world . Absurdity is brought about because the human instinct to seek order and meaning is frustrated by the refusal of the world to be orderly or meaningful . Anxiety : Kierkegaard said , \" Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom . \" You feel anxiety because you recognize that you and you alone are responsible for your actions . This produces the two - sided feeling of simultaneous dread and exhilaration . Alienation : The sense that you 're a stranger in the world , or a stranger to yourself . Many aspects of existence can be alienating . One of the primary sources is absurdity . Ironically , the stories and systems developed by philosophy and religion to address that absurdity can be just as alienating . Existence precedes essence : Sartre 's phrase to describe the existential situation humans find themselves in . It refers to the fact that when you 're born , you have no meaning , no purpose , no definition . Human beings exist first , and only later define themselves . The \u00dcbermensch : The word Nietzsche uses to refer to his ideal human being . Literally \" overman , \" the word reflects the importance in his philosophy of overcoming \u2014 overcoming traditional values , overcoming the herd mentality , and , most importantly , overcoming yourself . You overcome these things so that you might attain something greater . Nietzsche 's \u00dcbermensch is an unconventional creator of values , a joyous free spirit , and one who embraces the earth instead of pining away for heaven . The death of God : The death of the notion that belief in God alone , or belief in any religious or philosophical system , is sufficient to provide human beings with the meaning , purpose , and definition they crave . It 's the recognition that , because no external system can provide you with the answers , you must take responsibility for providing them yourself . Subjectivity : Your first - person perspective on the world , including the needs , desires , and emotions that accompany that perspective . The existentialists take this as a valid and important starting point for genuinely human endeavors . This can be contrasted with the scientific mindset , which always starts with objectivity \u2014 seeing people in impersonal , objective terms without emotion or appreciation for their individual point of view .",

    "answer": "Existentialism is a philosophical way of thinking about the world and our place in it. It is concerned with questions about the meaning of life, and what it means to be human. \nOne of the main ideas of existentialism is that each person is responsible for creating their own meaning in life. This means that we have the freedom to choose how we want to live, and that we are responsible for the choices we make. \nExistentialism also emphasizes the importance of individual experience and subjective perspective. It suggests that each person's experience of the world is unique, and that it is up to each individual to decide what is important and meaningful to them. \nExistentialism can be a difficult concept to understand, but one way to think about it is that it is a way of looking at the world that emphasizes the importance of being true to oneself and living a life that is meaningful to you.",

    "question": "If I was thrown into the future , how far would I go before I could't understand \" Future English \" ? Since languages have evolved , how long is 21st century English supposed to \" last \" ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Since the past is our only reference point , let 's see when past forms of English became intelligible to modern speakers . I do n't think the high volume of written communication will have quite the effect the other commenters think . While written communication does preserve language , it by no means slows down change . Additionally , internet chats and texting have turned out to be ripe fields for linguistic play , so while I think our high volume of writing will have * an * effect , I 'm not convinced its effect will be to measurably slow down the evolution of the language . Changes do take longer to be entombed in writing though , so I think it 's likely you 'll be able to * read * future!English past the time you can no longer understand spoken future!English . By 1,000 years in the future I 'd expect future!English to be opaque to a speaker today . For reference , here 's English text from roughly 1,000 years ago ( Part of * Beowulf * ) > lange \u00ferage ; he him \u00f0\u00e6s lean forgeald . II Gewat \u00f0a neosian , sy\u00fe\u00f0an niht becom , hean huses , hu hit Hring - Dene \u00e6fter beor\u00feege gebun h\u00e6fdon . You can guess a couple words in there , but it 's meaningless today . So , let 's come up about 500 years and take a look at ( of course ) Chaucer . > If I foryete to tellen the dispence Of Theseus , that gooth so bisily To maken up the lystes roially ; That swich a noble theatre as it was , I dar wel seyen , in this world ther nas . That looks better . If we update the spelling to be correct in today 's English : > If I forget to tellen the dispence of Theseus , that goeth so busily to maken up the lists royally ; that such a noble theater as it was , I dare well sayen , in this world there nas Hey , mostly intelligible ! But still pretty different : note the no - longer - used verb forms * tellen * and * goeth * . [ Here 's ] ( URL_1 ) a recording . It sounds like a very odd dialect of English , but with a little practice you could probably learn it . It is not , however , immediately intelligible to an English speaker today . So , somewhere between 500 years and 1,000 years in the future we 'd expect English to go from \" kinda sorta intelligible to someone today \" to \" could be Thai for all I know \" , assuming that past trends continue into the future . For funsies , [ here 's a guy ] ( URL_0 ) who posited what English could sound like in the future .",

    "question": "If I was thrown into the future , how far would I go before I could't understand \" Future English \" ? Since languages have evolved , how long is 21st century English supposed to \" last \" ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "It's difficult to predict exactly how languages will evolve over time, but it's likely that if you were thrown into the future, you would be able to understand the English spoken there for at least a few hundred years. This is because even though languages change and evolve, they tend to do so gradually over long periods of time. \nHowever, it's also possible that English could change more quickly in the future due to factors such as technological advances or cultural changes. In that case, it might be more difficult for you to understand the English spoken in the future. \nOverall, it's important to remember that languages are always changing and evolving, and it's natural for new words and phrases to be added and for the meanings of existing words to shift over time. However, this process tends to happen slowly, so it's likely that you would still be able to understand the English spoken in the future for a significant period of time.",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why it might cost more to cut down your own Christmas tree than to buy a pre-cut tree. One reason is that the cost of the tree itself might be higher at a farm where you can cut your own tree, because the farm is providing a service to you by allowing you to come and cut your own tree. This service might include things like providing a place to park, a place to warm up, and staff to assist you. \nAnother reason is that the cost of cutting down your own tree might include the cost of gas and other expenses related to driving out to the farm, such as wear and tear on your vehicle. Finally, the cost of cutting down your own tree might include the cost of the chainsaw and other equipment that you need to use, such as safety gear. \nOverall, the cost of cutting down your own tree might be higher because you are paying for the convenience of having everything provided for you, as well as the experience of finding and cutting down your own tree.",

    "answer": "Ceiling fans are designed to help cool a room by circulating air around it. When you turn on a ceiling fan, the blades of the fan start spinning around. As the blades spin, they push the air in the room up towards the ceiling. This can help to make the room feel cooler because the circulating air can help evaporate sweat on your skin, which can make you feel more comfortable. \nCeiling fans are not designed to lower the temperature of a room, but they can make a room feel cooler by helping to circulate the air. They can also help to save energy because they use less electricity than an air conditioner and can help you feel more comfortable at a higher temperature setting on your thermostat. \nSo, in short, ceiling fans are a useful way to help cool a room and make it feel more comfortable, and they can also help save energy by allowing you to use your air conditioner less.",

    "question": "Why are companies like Tesla and Toyota giving away their patents ? link to the news : URL_0 It just seems counter intuitive to me . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Especially in the case of Tesla , when they released their Electric Vehicle patents last year , there was not enough electric vehicle infrastructure to make their product useful and desirable for a large market . If they want to create demand , Electric Cars and make EV 's desirable in the mass market , the speed at which new technologies ( for things like range between charges , and increasing the speed of charges ) has to increase , and one of the best ways to create an environment for that is competition . If Tesla and Toyota can create a competitive market for EV 's , new technologies will emerge faster , demand will go up , the market will increase and everybody makes money . In a world where there were only a few EV companies , and they were keeping their patents secret , all of the development and implementation costs would be on them . It would be crazy expensive and require a huge investment . This way , they are better able to spread those costs and that work around . In the end , they may own a smaller percentage of the market , but the market will be much larger then if they had gone for it alone . That 's why Tesla released all of their Electric Vehicle patents last year . The pace of development for the Hydrogen Fuel Cell car has been very very very slow , so Toyota has the same ideas for Fuel Cells . Create a market , increase competition , everybody profits . Also , the goal of getting the world of off fossil fuels ASAP is pretty admirable .",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why companies like Tesla and Toyota might choose to give away their patents. One reason might be to encourage the development of new technologies or to encourage the widespread adoption of their technologies. By making their patents available to other companies or individuals, they can help to stimulate innovation and competition, which can ultimately lead to the development of new products or services that benefit society as a whole. \nAnother reason that companies might give away their patents is to build partnerships or collaborations with other organizations. By sharing their patents with other companies, they can work together to develop new technologies or products, which can be beneficial for both parties. \nIt's important to note that giving away patents does not necessarily mean that a company is giving up all rights to their technology. They may still be able to license the technology to others or receive compensation for its use in some cases. Ultimately, the decision to give away patents is a strategic one that companies make based on their business goals and the needs of their industry.",

    "question": "What is the trust fund loophole Obama mentioned in his SOTU address ? I keep hearing more about this trust fund loophole and I only kind of understand it . Can anyone explain it like I 'm 5 ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Not really ELI5 - able because it 's a complicated subject but : So , whenever you sell property ( subject to an insane number of rules ) you calculated the amount that you gained or lost on your investment , and if you had a gain ( called a \" capital gain \" ) they you pay taxes on that gain . As an example : you buy $ 10,000 worth of stock , then sell it a year later for $ 30,000 ( good investment ) and pay taxes on your $ 20,000 ( $ 30,000 - $ 10,000 ) profit . Now , for inherited items , this gets a little tricky . So instead of you buying that stock , lets say your grandfather bought it at $ 10,000 and when he died it was worth $ 25,000 , and when you finally sold it you got $ 30,000 for it . Under the current tax plan , you 're only required to pay taxes on a gain of $ 5,000 , because you 're allowed to use the value at the time of inheritance as your \" basis \" in the stock ( \" basis \" is the technical term for basically \" the value you calculate your gain / loss from \" ) . * * Under the new plan :* * you would instead pay taxes on the $ 20,000 gain , using the original $ 10,000 basis from the original purchase of the stock ( with exemptions of something like $ 250,000 per person , to spare the middle class ) . Also , note that capital gains have generally been taxed at a lower percentage than ordinary income ( currently 15 % for anyone in the 25 % income tax bracket or up ) , with the rationale being basically that this will encourage business investment . Of course , since many very rich people make the vast majority of their income in the form of capital gains and not salary , it also causes the famous case of billionaires paying lower tax rates than their secretaries ( see : Buffett , Warren ) . In a related proposal , Obama has suggest raising the capital gains rate to 28 % for couples with incomes in excess of $ 500,000 . Those two changes would result in the government raising a lot of extra revenue ( as well as long - term macroeconomic consequences that I am not qualified to speculate on ) .

    "answer": "I'm sorry, but I don't have information about a specific trust fund loophole mentioned by President Obama in a State of the Union address. Trust funds are financial instruments that are set up to hold and manage assets on behalf of a specific person or group of people. The assets in a trust fund can come from a variety of sources, such as investments, gifts, or inheritance, and the trust fund is managed by a trustee, who is responsible for distributing the assets in the trust according to the terms of the trust agreement. \nA loophole is a gap or weakness in a law or system that can be exploited or used to avoid a requirement or restriction. It's possible that President Obama was referring to a specific provision in the tax code that allows certain types of trust funds to be used in a way that might be perceived as avoiding taxes or otherwise taking advantage of the system. However, without more context, it's difficult to say for sure what he was referring to.",

    "answer": "I had a friend who did not believe in evolution , and we discussed this . It comes down to this : they ( or at least some people ) believe in \" microevolution , \" but not \" macroevolution . \" To them , microevolution means changes within a species , or \" kind \" . A wolf to a dog , or one type of bird into another , for example . Macroevolution , to them , means one species or \" kind \" changing into another . Like fish into things that walk on land . The idea of \" kinds \" comes from the Bible , for example in the story of Noah : > In the selfsame day entered Noah , and Shem , and Ham , and Japheth , the sons of Noah , and Noah 's wife , and the three wives of his sons with them , into the ark ; They , and every beast after his kind , and all the cattle after their kind , and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind , and every fowl after his kind , every bird of every sort . ( Gen 7:13 - 14 ) This idea does n't necessarily line up with the scientific idea of \" species . \" For example , in this view , all hoofed animals might belong to the same \" kind . \" It does allow them to say that maybe Noah only brought a few animals onto the Ark , representing all of the different \" kinds , \" and then after that , they changed into all the animals we have today ( while still staying within their \" kind \" ) . This , at least , was the explanation that I got from my friend . What he was really opposed to was the idea that \" a lizard could change into a mammal , \" or similar .",

    "answer": "People who do not believe in evolution can explain things like breeding dogs and why people look like their parents in a number of ways. One possibility is that they believe that these things are the result of a divine or supernatural force that has shaped the world and its inhabitants in a specific way. For example, they might believe that God or another higher power created dogs with the ability to breed and produce offspring that resemble their parents because that is what God or the higher power wanted to happen. \nAlternatively, people who do not believe in evolution might believe that these things occur through some other natural process that is not related to evolution. For example, they might believe that the similarities between parents and their children are simply due to genetics, and that genetics works in a way that is unrelated to evolution. \nIn any case, it is important to note that the scientific theory of evolution explains these phenomena through the process of natural selection, in which certain traits are passed down from one generation to the next because they help the organisms that have them to survive and reproduce. This process is supported by a large body of evidence from many different fields of science, including paleontology, genetics, and more.",

    "answer": "Emotions and love are complex phenomena that have evolved in many different species, including humans and other mammals. Scientists believe that emotions and social bonds, like love, have evolved in animals because they help them to survive and reproduce. \nFor example, emotions like fear and anxiety help animals to avoid dangerous situations, while positive emotions like joy and love help animals to form social bonds and cooperate with others. These social bonds can be important for finding food, raising young, and protecting against predators. \nLove is a particularly powerful emotion that can motivate us to take care of and protect our loved ones. In humans and other mammals, love is often associated with the hormone oxytocin, which is involved in bonding and attachment. \nIt's important to note that the way animals experience and express emotions is likely to be different from the way humans do. However, the basic functions of emotions and social bonds, like love, are likely to be similar across different species.",

    "answer": "During the Cold War, the border between East and West Germany was heavily guarded and patrolled by both East German and Soviet forces. It was very difficult for people living in East Berlin to cross the border illegally, especially at places where the border was heavily guarded. If someone was caught trying to cross the border illegally, they could face severe punishment, including imprisonment or even death. \nAdditionally, the border between East and West Germany was not just a physical barrier, but also a political and ideological divide. The East German government did not want people to leave the country, as it saw this as a loss of human capital and a blow to the regime's legitimacy. As a result, the East German government took steps to make it very difficult for people to leave the country, including building the Berlin Wall and other barriers along the border. \nSo while it might have been possible for some people to try to cross the border at less heavily guarded areas, it was still a very risky and dangerous endeavor.",

Additionally, they may have been subjected to violent intimidation and threats of harm if they resisted, which could have made it difficult for them to defy their captors.

    "answer": "A ' DJ set ' is one that comprises wholly of an artist ' mixing ' 2 ( or some times more ) separate , pre - recorded tracks .

Whilst effects can be used to augment the songs ( e.g. delay ) , there is no element of new song design - the DJ merely plays with what is already there in the song . A ' live DJ set ' involves the DJ constructing the song from pre - made samples or from creating the songs entirely from scratch , using sounds from a digital source ( e.g. Ableton ) and then augmenting the song they have made as they go along .

The hot air will rise, making the balloon go up. If the pilot wants to go down, they can turn off the burner and let the air inside the balloon cool, causing the balloon to sink. \nTo move the balloon left or right, the pilot can tilt the balloon in the desired direction. The wind will then carry the balloon that way. The pilot can also try to find winds that are blowing in the direction they want to go and use those to help steer the balloon. \nSo while the pilot doesn't have complete control over the balloon's movement, they do have some tools they can use to try to steer it in the direction they want to go.",

    "answer": "In almost everywhere in the US ( if not everywhere ) , suicide / attempted suicide is not illegal .

Granted a lot of the repercussions of this are similar to being arrested for illegal acts , being detained , held against your will in a facility , losing some rights etc . , but there 's also some differences such as not having a criminal record . Assisted suicide is illegal though , and that 's partially because the state does n't want to be involved in trying to determine if someone is guilty of murder or if they were just assisting suicide , and the other part being it 's stance against suicide anyhow . Even in states that have death with dignity acts , they 're not exactly assisted suicide .

    "question": "Why is suicide/ assisted suicide illegal ? Why is it that someone terminal , or even just in immense pain can not ask to end their life with ease ? What is the justification behind not allowing it ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Suicide and assisted suicide are generally illegal because they are considered to be harmful and a violation of the individual's inherent right to life. Many people believe that every person has the right to live their life to the fullest and that it is not up to anyone else to decide when that life should end. Additionally, some people believe that suicide and assisted suicide go against the values of many societies and religions, which often view suicide as a sin or a moral failing. \nThere are also practical considerations that can make suicide and assisted suicide difficult to allow. For example, if someone is in immense pain, there may be medical treatments or other forms of support that can help alleviate that pain and make their life more bearable. Additionally, some people who are considering suicide may be experiencing a temporary crisis or mental health issue that could be treated with therapy or medication. \nOverall, the decision to make suicide and assisted suicide illegal is typically based on a combination of moral, ethical, and practical considerations.",

    "question": "What 's the difference between the alcohol we drink vs. the alcohol we use as mouthwash ? Or like rubbing alcohol for instance Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "They are similar ( but different ) molecules . Drinking alcohol is ethyl alcohol , which is a molecule made up of 2 carbon atoms , 6 hydrogen , and 1 oxygen . Rubbing alcohol is isopropyl alcohol , which is another type of alcohol with three carbon atoms , 8 hydrogen , and one oxygen . These molecules may be similar , but the body digests them very differently . Ethanol is fairly safe to drink because it gets converted into acetaldehyde which is mostly safe , while isopropyl alcohol gets converted into acetone , which is toxic . Mouthwash contains 20 - 40 % ethanol ( the same stuff we drink ) However , it also contains other stuff that is toxic if swallowed in large amounts , so do n't drink it .",

    "question": "What 's the difference between the alcohol we drink vs. the alcohol we use as mouthwash ? Or like rubbing alcohol for instance Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Sure! The alcohol that we drink, such as beer, wine, and liquor, is a type of alcohol called ethanol. It is made by fermenting grains, fruits, or vegetables. When we drink ethanol, it can affect our bodies and our brains, and it can be harmful if we drink too much of it. \nRubbing alcohol, on the other hand, is a type of alcohol called isopropyl alcohol. It is a chemical that is made from a mixture of water and chemicals called hydrocarbons. Isopropyl alcohol is used as a disinfectant and can be found in some hand sanitizers, cleaning products, and first aid kits. It can also be used to cool the skin or to help dry out blisters. \nUnlike ethanol, isopropyl alcohol is not safe to drink. It can cause nausea, vomiting, and other harmful side effects if ingested. So it is important to only use rubbing alcohol for its intended purposes and to keep it away from children and pets.",

    "answer": "It's possible to make emergency calls even if you don't have a signal or a SIM card in your phone. Here's how it works: \n1. Dial the emergency number: In most countries, the emergency number is either 911 or 112. If you're not sure what the emergency number is in your location, you can try dialing both numbers to see which one works. \n2. Wait for a response: When you dial the emergency number, your phone will try to connect to the emergency services network. This network is separate from the regular phone network, so it's possible to connect even if you don't have a signal or a SIM card. \n3. Provide your location: If the call goes through, an operator will answer and ask for your location. It's important to give them as much information as you can so they can send help to the right place. If you don't know your exact location, try to describe your surroundings or give them any landmarks you can see. \n4. Stay on the line: The operator will stay on the line with you until help arrives. They may ask you more questions or give you instructions on what to do. It's important to stay calm and follow their instructions. \nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.",

I am looking for a detailed explanation in terms of chain of command , and the probability of success vs. failure . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Stopping a meteor from hitting Earth would be a very difficult task, and the chances of success would depend on a number of factors, including the size of the meteor, how much warning we have before it hits, and how much time and resources we have to prepare. Here's a simple explanation of how it might work: \n1. First, we would need to detect the meteor and determine its trajectory. This could be done using telescopes or satellites that are designed to look for objects moving through space. \n2. Once we know where the meteor is headed, we would need to decide how to stop it. There are a few different ways we might try to do this, depending on the size of the meteor and how much time we have before it hits. \n3. One option would be to use a \"gravity tractor,\" which is a spacecraft that would fly alongside the meteor and use its own gravitational pull to slowly change the meteor's course. This would take a long time, and might not be practical if we don't have enough warning. \n4. Another option would be to use a \"kinetic impactor,\" which is a spacecraft that would collide with the meteor at high speed. This would try to knock the meteor off course or break it into smaller pieces that would be less dangerous. \n5. Finally, we might try to use a \"nuclear device,\" which is a bomb that would explode near the meteor and try to break it up or change its course. This would be a very risky option, because a nuclear explosion could create a lot of debris that could also hit Earth. \nOverall, stopping a meteor from hitting Earth would be a very challenging task, and the chances of success would depend on a lot of factors. It would require a coordinated effort from scientists, engineers, and government agencies around the world, and we would need to act quickly and make some difficult decisions.",

    "answer": "Being a carbon-based life form means that the structure of the molecules that make up the organism's body are based on carbon. Carbon is a chemical element that is found in all living things and is essential for life. It is a very special element because it can form a large number of chemical bonds with other elements, including other carbon atoms, which allows it to be a building block for the complex molecules that are necessary for life. \nIn the human body, carbon is found in many different molecules, including proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. It is also found in the nucleic acids DNA and RNA, which carry the genetic information that is passed from one generation to the next. \nOverall, the human body is made up of about 18% carbon by weight. While this may not seem like a lot, it is a critical element for the functioning of the body. Without carbon, life as we know it would not be possible.",

    "answer": "Curved televisions have a screen that is curved, rather than flat. The curve is usually gentle and is designed to be more immersive for the viewer. Some people think that the curve helps to make the image on the screen feel more \"wraparound,\" like you're looking at a bigger, more expansive scene. \nThere are a few potential benefits to using a curved television. For one, the curve of the screen can help to reduce reflections from windows or other light sources in the room. This can make it easier to see the picture on the screen, especially in a brightly lit room. Additionally, some people find that the curve helps to make the edges of the screen feel more \"invisible,\" which can make the picture feel more \"all-encompassing.\" \nHowever, it's worth noting that not everyone finds curved televisions to be an improvement over flat screens. Some people find that the curve causes distortion in the image, which can be distracting. Additionally, curved TVs are generally more expensive than flat TVs, so they may not be the best choice for everyone.",

    "answer": "Game shows are able to afford to reward contestants because they are financed through a combination of advertising revenue and production costs. The amount of money that a contestant wins on a game show can vary widely, depending on the specific show and the rules of the game. Some game shows may offer smaller prizes, while others may offer larger cash prizes or even expensive items such as cars or vacations. \nContestants on game shows are often chosen through a selection process that includes an application and an audition. The producers of the show may select a group of contestants from a pool of applicants, and these contestants will compete against each other on the show. The winner of each game show episode will typically receive a prize, while the other contestants may not receive anything. \nIt's also worth noting that not all game shows offer cash prizes. Some shows may offer other types of prizes, such as trips or merchandise. Additionally, some game shows may be structured so that the contestants are not competing against each other, but rather working together as a team to try to win a prize. In these cases, the prize may be shared among the team members.",

Constant CPU usage: If the app is constantly using the CPU, even when it's not doing anything useful, it can drain the battery faster. \n3. Constant network usage: If the app is constantly making network requests or using data, it can drain the battery faster. \n4. Poorly designed user interface: If the app has a poorly designed user interface that requires the user to perform a lot of unnecessary actions, it can drain the battery faster. \n5. Lack of power management: If the app doesn't properly manage power usage, it may keep the device's power-hungry components, such as the CPU or display, turned on unnecessarily, which can drain the battery faster. \nTo summarize, bad or sloppy code can make an app drain your battery faster by causing it to use more CPU and network resources, having a poorly designed user interface, or not properly managing power usage.",

    "question": "How does adding volumes work ? I know this might seem like a silly question , but for example when 10 people are talking at 20 dB , what happens to the resulting dB heard by somebody in the room ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "There are some simple rules for calculating with db . The easiest one to remember is that multiplying something by a numbers adds something to the db value . Multiplying with 10 adds exactly 10 db . So you would hear all the people talking at 30 db . Another rule that is handy to now is that multiplying by 2 adds about 3 db . That means 2 people would make 23 db noise , 4 people 26 db and 8 people 29 db . In addition to that you can split larger numbers up for example multiplying by 80 ( for example 80 talking people ) would be 8 * 10 which is 2 * 2 * 2 * 10 and with the mentioned rules you get 3 + 3 + 3 + 10 = 19db more . But that 's just a theoretical value that would work if all the sound happens at the same place . People are usually not just standing inside each other that 's why you 'd end up with slightly different numbers if your standing in the middle of the 10 people or right next besides them . But it works just fine for most applications .",

    "question": "How does adding volumes work ? I know this might seem like a silly question , but for example when 10 people are talking at 20 dB , what happens to the resulting dB heard by somebody in the room ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "When multiple sounds are present at the same time, they can combine to create a louder or quieter overall sound. This is called \"additive volume.\" \nImagine you have two speakers that are both playing music at the same volume. If you stand in the middle of the speakers, the music will sound louder than if you stand next to just one of the speakers. This is because the sound waves from both speakers are combining and adding together to create a louder overall sound. \nNow, let's say that instead of two speakers, you have 10 people all talking at the same volume (let's say 20 dB). If you are in the same room as all of the people, the overall sound will be louder than if you were just listening to one person speaking at 20 dB. This is because all of the voices are combining and adding together to create a louder overall sound. \nSo, to answer your question, when multiple people are talking at the same volume (like 20 dB), the resulting sound that you hear will be louder than if you were just listening to one person speaking at that volume. The exact amount of volume increase will depend on the number of people talking and the volume of their individual voices.",

    "answer": "Difficulty settings in video games are usually implemented by adjusting certain variables or parameters in the game's code. For example, in a sports game, the difficulty setting might affect how accurately the computer-controlled players perform, or how quickly they react to the player's actions. \nTo make the game easier, the game's developers might give the computer-controlled players less skill, or make them less likely to make good plays. On the other hand, to make the game harder, the developers might give the computer-controlled players more skill, or make them more likely to make good plays. \nThere are many other ways that difficulty settings can be implemented, depending on the specific game and the type of challenges that it presents to the player. For example, a game might adjust the amount of damage that the player character takes, or the number of enemies that appear, to make the game easier or harder. \nOverall, the main idea is that the game's code is set up to allow the developers to adjust certain variables or parameters to change the difficulty of the game. This can be done through a menu or other interface that lets the player choose the difficulty level that they want to play at.",

    "answer": "It is not clear whether dogs have a concept of death in the same way that humans do. Humans have a complex understanding of death, including an awareness of their own mortality and the finality of death. Dogs, on the other hand, do not have the same level of cognitive ability and may not fully understand the concept of death. \nHowever, dogs are highly social animals and are able to form strong bonds with their owners and other animals. When a dog loses a companion, whether it is another dog, a human, or another animal, they may display signs of grief and loss, such as lethargy, loss of appetite, and changes in behavior. This suggests that dogs are able to recognize that their companion is no longer present and may be able to understand that death is a permanent separation. \nIt is also possible that dogs have a basic instinctual understanding of death, as they may be more attuned to changes in the environment and the behavior of other animals, and may be able to sense when an animal is sick or injured. However, it is difficult to say for certain whether dogs have a fully developed concept of death, as this is a complex and abstract concept that may be beyond their cognitive abilities.",

Inbreeding can lead to an increased risk of genetic disorders and other health problems in the offspring. \nHowever, it's important to note that one male and one female would not be enough to fully repopulate an entire population. It would take many more individuals to establish a diverse and healthy population. \nIn addition, humans have a built-in mechanism called \"genetic recombination\" that helps to mix up and shuffle our genes from one generation to the next.

    "question": "Is there anything chemically that happens in the body to trigger high or low self esteem ? In other words , is it solely based off of moments in our lives that create our own self perception or is it chemically predetermined to an extent ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Self-esteem is a person's overall sense of self-worth or how they value themselves. It is not solely based on chemical processes in the body, but rather is influenced by a variety of factors including life experiences, thoughts, and beliefs, and social and cultural influences. \nIt is normal for self-esteem to fluctuate and change over time, and it can be affected by both positive and negative experiences. For example, a person who receives positive feedback and recognition for their accomplishments may have a higher sense of self-esteem, while a person who experiences failure or criticism may have a lower sense of self-esteem. \nWhile chemical processes in the body, such as the release of certain hormones or neurotransmitters, can influence a person's mood and emotions, they do not directly determine self-esteem. However, mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety can affect self-esteem, and these conditions may be influenced by chemical imbalances in the body. \nIt is important to remember that self-esteem is not fixed and can be improved with effort and self-care. It is important to focus on building self-esteem by setting and achieving goals, practicing self-compassion and self-acceptance, and surrounding oneself with supportive and positive people.",

    "answer": "Roosters are male chickens, and they have a natural tendency to crow or make a loud noise, called \"cock-a-doodle-doo,\" at dawn. This behavior is controlled by a biological clock called the circadian rhythm, which helps regulate their sleep patterns and other daily activities. \nCrowing is a way for roosters to communicate with other chickens and to establish their territory. It is also a way for them to attract females, or hens, to mate with. When a rooster crows, it is telling other roosters to stay away from its territory and letting the hens know that it is ready to mate. \nSo, roosters crow in the morning because it is a way for them to communicate and establish their territory, and this behavior is controlled by their internal biological clock.",

    "question": "If speakers oscillate in and out how do they make complex waveforms that are made of more than just simple tones ? Someone tried explaining it to me by saying that different parts of the speaker move independently of one another but I am still confused . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "That 's because they do n't do that . At least , a simple single speaker does n't . A simple tone would be a regular sinusoidal variation , going in and out with the same period each time . The flip side is , if you have a microphone operating on the same principle , and you have a pure tone , it would vibrate the cone back and forth in exactly the same way . You can make a microphone like this , but it 's not the most efficient way to do it . They usually use other components . Now imagine you have two tones , one high and one low . The two waves on a microphone would add together . This will give a more complicated wave that is the two waves added together . If you made the speaker oscillate in this exact same pattern , it would produce the two tones at once . [ Example image ] ( URL_0 ) From there you can just keep adding as many frequencies as you like . The waveform is very complicated in the end , but the shape is just the shape of all those sound waves added together .",

Someone tried explaining it to me by saying that different parts of the speaker move independently of one another but I am still confused . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Speakers produce sound by vibrating a flexible membrane called a diaphragm. When an electrical signal is sent to the speaker, it causes the diaphragm to move back and forth rapidly, creating sound waves in the air. \nThe shape and movement of the diaphragm determines the type of sound that the speaker produces. For example, if the diaphragm moves in a simple, regular pattern, it will produce a pure tone or sine wave. However, if the diaphragm moves in a more complex pattern, it can produce more complex waveforms, such as those found in music and other sounds. \nTo create these complex waveforms, the speaker uses multiple small electrical signals that are combined together. Each signal causes a specific part of the diaphragm to vibrate in a certain way, and when all of these vibrations are combined, they create the overall movement of the diaphragm. \nThink of it like a group of people all clapping together to make a beat. Each person is making a simple clapping motion, but when they all clap together, they create a more complex and varied sound. Similarly, the different signals sent to the speaker's diaphragm work together to create a more complex sound wave.",

    "answer": "Perfectionism is the belief that everything must be done perfectly, or it is not worth doing at all. This can be a negative trait because it can lead to unrealistic expectations and an inability to accept mistakes or imperfections. It can also lead to excessive stress, anxiety, and disappointment. \nDoing your best, on the other hand, means trying your hardest and striving for excellence, but also accepting that mistakes and imperfections are a natural part of the process. It means being proud of what you have achieved, even if it is not perfect. \nImagine you are trying to draw a picture. If you are a perfectionist, you might get frustrated if the lines are not perfectly straight, or if the colors are not exactly as you imagined them. You might even give up on the drawing altogether because it is not perfect. If you are just trying your best, you might still strive to make your drawing as good as possible, but you will also be proud of what you have created, even if it is not perfect. \nSo in short, perfectionism is the belief that everything must be perfect, while doing your best means trying your hardest and being proud of your efforts, even if they are not perfect.",

    "question": "How does a bank make money ? How does a bank make the money to pay employees and provide interest ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "There 's a concept in economics called the money multiplier . Basically , a bank is only required to keep 10 % of the value of its deposits on hand , and loans out the other 90 % . The money that 's loaned out is spent , deposited in a bank , and loaned out again . For example , A bank has $ 100,000 in deposits . It keeps $ 10,000 on hand , and lends $ 90,000 to Bob for a new house . Bob gives that $ 90,000 to the house 's previous owner , who deposits it in the bank . The bank keeps $ 9000 on hand and lends the other $ 81,000 to Jeff for a new sports car . The car dealer gets paid , the bank keeps $ 8100 on hand , and loans out the other 72,900 to Mike .

    "answer": "Sure! A bank makes money by lending out money to people and businesses and charging them interest on the loans. For example, if someone takes out a mortgage to buy a house, the bank will lend them the money to buy the house and charge them interest on the loan. The bank will also charge people and businesses fees for other services, such as cashing checks or setting up a new bank account. \nThe bank uses the money it makes from loans and fees to pay its employees and provide interest to people who have deposited money in the bank. When people deposit money in the bank, the bank is allowed to use that money to make loans to other people. In return, the bank pays the depositors a small amount of interest on their money. This is how a bank is able to make money and provide interest at the same time.",

    "answer": "There can be several reasons why some sellers on Amazon Marketplace (or any other online marketplace) might have products that are significantly inflated in price. One reason could be that the seller is trying to make a profit by selling the product for more than they paid for it. Another reason could be that the seller is trying to take advantage of high demand for the product by charging a premium price. In some cases, the seller might not realize that the price they are charging is significantly higher than the market price for the product. \nIt's also possible that some sellers might intentionally inflate the price of a product in the hopes that some users will purchase it without realizing that they could get the same product for a lower price elsewhere. This is known as \"price gouging\" and is generally considered unethical. However, it's important to note that not all sellers who have inflated prices are intentionally trying to take advantage of their customers. \nIn any case, it's always a good idea to do some research and compare prices before making a purchase, especially if you think the price of a product seems unusually high. This can help you make sure that you are getting the best deal possible and avoid being overcharged.",

    "answer": "Lamb fur and wool are both materials that come from animals, but they are not the same thing. Lamb fur is the soft, thick hair that grows on the body of a lamb (a young sheep). Wool, on the other hand, is the hair that grows on the body of an adult sheep. \nLamb fur is often used to make clothing and other items because it is very soft and warm. It is also sometimes used to make toys and other soft items. Wool, on the other hand, is a more versatile material that can be used to make a wide variety of products, including clothing, blankets, and carpets. It is also a good insulator, which means it helps to keep you warm in cold weather. \nIn general, lamb fur is considered to be a more luxurious and expensive material than wool because it is softer and more rare. However, both materials can be very warm and durable, and the choice between the two may come down to personal preference.",

    "answer": "The passive tense is not considered incorrect by most English professors. It is a grammatically correct way to construct a sentence in English. However, it is often considered less desirable than the active tense because it can make sentences less direct and less clear. \nIn the active tense, the subject of the sentence is performing the action. For example, in the sentence \"The car struck her,\" the subject of the sentence is \"the car,\" and it is performing the action of striking. \nIn the passive tense, the subject of the sentence is receiving the action. For example, in the sentence \"She was struck by a car,\" the subject of the sentence is \"she,\" and she is receiving the action of being struck. \nThe passive tense can make sentences less direct and less clear because it can make it less obvious who is performing the action. It can also make sentences longer and more wordy. \nFor these reasons, many English professors and writing guides recommend using the active tense whenever possible to make your writing clearer and more concise. However, there are times when the passive tense can be useful, such as when you want to emphasize the person or thing receiving the action, or when you don't know who is performing the action.",

    "answer": "It is not accurate to say that France is \"picked on\" for surrendering during World War II. Surrender is a common aspect of warfare, and it is not uncommon for countries to surrender when they are unable to continue fighting or when the cost of continuing to fight is too high. \nDuring World War II, France was one of the major powers that was part of the Allied powers, which also included countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. France was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1940, and after a series of battles, the French government was forced to sign an armistice with Germany, which effectively ended the fighting between the two countries. \nIt is important to remember that the decision to surrender is often a difficult one that is made by governments and military leaders, and it is not meant to be taken lightly. Surrendering can be seen as a way to protect the lives and well-being of the people in the country, and it can also be a way to end a conflict that has caused a lot of suffering and destruction. In the case of France during World War II, the decision to surrender was likely made in order to try to protect the people of France and to avoid further loss of life.",

    "answer": "The political spectrum is a way of organizing political beliefs and ideologies into categories. The left side of the spectrum typically represents more liberal or progressive ideas, such as the belief in more government intervention in the economy and society, and more equality and social justice. The right side of the spectrum typically represents more conservative or traditional ideas, such as the belief in less government intervention in the economy and society, and more individual freedom and responsibility. \nThe National Socialist German Workers' Party, or Nazi party, was a far-right, authoritarian political party that held extremist and totalitarian ideologies. While the party's name included the word \"socialist,\" the party's policies and actions were diametrically opposed to the principles of socialism and the left side of the political spectrum. The Nazi party believed in racial purity, national pride, and the supremacy of the state over the individual, and it implemented policies that led to the persecution and extermination of millions of people, including Jews, Romani people, disabled people, and others.

    "answer": "Internet download speeds are typically faster than upload speeds because most people use the internet to download more than they use it to upload. For example, when you are browsing the internet, you are downloading information from websites onto your device. When you watch a video on YouTube, you are downloading the video from YouTube's servers onto your device. When you send an email or message, you are uploading information from your device to the internet. \nInternet service providers (ISPs) usually focus on providing fast download speeds because that is what most people need. They also need to balance the amount of bandwidth they provide for download speeds with the amount of bandwidth they provide for upload speeds. If they provide too much bandwidth for downloads, it could cause problems for people uploading information. \nSo, to sum it up, internet download speeds are typically faster than upload speeds because most people use the internet to download more than they use it to upload, and ISPs need to balance the amount of bandwidth they provide for both types of internet traffic.",

They can be caused by injuries, surgeries, or certain skin conditions. Scars are usually flat and smoother than the surrounding skin and can be a different color or texture than the surrounding skin. \nWhile the skin is constantly shedding dead cells and regenerating new ones, these skin imperfections can remain because they are caused by changes in the skin cells or the skin's structure, which are not necessarily affected by the normal process of cell turnover.",

    "answer": "A judge in Texas, or any other state, does not have the power to block an executive action taken by the President of the United States. Executive actions are a type of presidential directive that have the force of law and are used to carry out the policies and priorities of the president. \nOnly the Supreme Court of the United States has the power to declare an executive action taken by the President to be unconstitutional. This process is called judicial review. In order for the Supreme Court to hear a case challenging an executive action, the case must be brought before the court through a legal process called \"appeal.\" \nIn addition to judicial review, Congress also has the power to block or overturn an executive action taken by the President. This can be done through a process called \"legislative veto,\" in which Congress passes a resolution disapproving of the executive action. However, the legislative veto can be vetoed by the President, and Congress would need a two-thirds majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate to override the veto. \nSo, while a judge in Texas or any other state does not have the power to block an executive action taken by the President, the action can be challenged and potentially overturned through the legal process of judicial review or through the legislative process by Congress.",

This infrastructure includes things like the launch pad, which is a platform that the rocket sits on before it takes off, and the control center, which is where the people who are in charge of the launch work. \nLaunching a rocket from the top of a mountain would be very difficult because the mountain would need to be tall enough and stable enough to support the weight of the rocket and all of its equipment. It would also be hard to build the infrastructure needed for the launch at the top of a mountain. \nAdditionally, launching a rocket from sea level, where the air is denser, can actually be more efficient because it allows the rocket to take advantage of the Earth's atmosphere to gain additional speed. This can reduce the amount of fuel that the rocket needs to carry with it, which makes it lighter and allows it to carry more payload (such as satellites or astronauts). \nFinally, it is generally easier and safer to launch rockets from the ground because it is easier to evacuate people and protect property if something goes wrong during the launch.",

    "answer": "Combining two or more WiFi networks is not possible because each WiFi network is a separate entity that operates on its own frequency band and is not connected to any other WiFi networks. When you connect to a WiFi network, you are connecting to a specific network that is broadcasting on a particular frequency band, and the router that is broadcasting that network is responsible for managing the data that is transmitted over that network. \nIn order to combine two or more WiFi networks, you would need a way to connect all of the routers together and merge their frequency bands into a single network. This is not possible with current technology because each router operates independently and does not have the ability to connect to or merge with other routers. \nAdditionally, even if it were possible to combine two or more WiFi networks, it would likely not result in a \"super fast\" WiFi connection. The speed of a WiFi connection is determined by a number of factors, including the strength of the signal, the distance between the device and the router, and the number of devices that are connected to the network. Simply adding more routers or merging multiple WiFi networks would not necessarily increase the speed of the connection.",

    "question": "People with liver disease have a unique smell . What is it ? I can walk into a room and smell that my brother was just there . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Most veins lead towards venae cavae ( the big veins in your torso that lead directly into the heart ) but there 's a system of veins ( known as portal veins ) that go from your intestines to your liver instead for detoxification and storage of nutrients . Then the blood continues on to the inferior vena cava . Blood ca n't flow as easily through a cirrhosed liver so it gets backed up and eventually is forced backwards into the rest of the circulatory system , normally through some veins around the lower oesophagus ( your food pipe ) and the stomach . This way you end up with blood going from your intestines ( carrying normal dissolved chemicals from your food ) to the general circulation without the liver ever cleaning it up , so to speak . Some of these chemicals end up in the lungs and are breathed out , like how when your blood has alcohol in it some of it comes out in your breath ( which is how breathalysers work and how we can smell when someone is really drunk ) . The technical term is foetor hepaticus and a main chemical compounds responsible are suspected to be dimethyl sulfide , found in several vegetables , and thiols or mercaptans , which are the chemicals added to natural gas to give it a distinctive smell .",

    "answer": "People with liver disease may have a distinct body odor that can be described as sweet or musty. This is because their liver is not functioning properly and is unable to remove certain substances from the body as it should. These substances, such as certain amino acids, can be broken down by bacteria on the skin and produce an unpleasant smell. It is not uncommon for people with liver disease to have a change in body odor, and it can be a sign of liver problems. However, it is important to note that not all people with liver disease will have a change in body odor, and other conditions can also cause changes in body odor. It is always important to speak with a medical professional if you are concerned about changes in your body odor or other symptoms that may be related to liver disease.",

They need a lot of energy to support their growth, and they get this energy from the calories in the breast milk or formula that they are fed. While protein is important for growth and development, babies don't need as much of it as adults do because their bodies are able to use protein more efficiently. Babies also don't do a lot of physical activity, so they don't need as much protein to build and repair muscles.

    "question": "open vs closed back headphones . What are the advantages and disadvantages for them and which ones are used for what ? Edit : thanks to everyone who took the time . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Open ones usually make the sound stage bigger , you will be able to differentiate different instruments in an orchestra . It 's just closer to listening to something in a big room . But it 's horrible for travelling around , you will hear all the noise around you and everyone around you will have to listen to your shitty music . Closed headphones cancel noise a lot better , you 'll be able to listen in noisy / busy environments without problems . For gaming it may be preferable or you might have some feedback to your microphone . That being said it does n't really matter for listening pleasure , everyone has his own preference . I like my open headphones for playing guitar , especially useful when i try to play along to a song but do n't want people to hear me practice , i can just turn up my sound system and use the headphones for guitar and i 'll be able to hear both quiet well . Or sometimes in the evening i use them as speakers , if you turn the volume up it 's usually good enough to listen to some silent music while you fall asleep . On the other hand i hate them for gaming , i sometimes confuse what happens around me for things in game and people on team speak hear my game sound when i turn it up too much . Using the closed phones allows me to leave the world behind and just life in the game for a while . For travelling / noisy environments i never carry around headphones ( i do n't know why anyone does ... i guess mostly for posing reason ) . My rather cheap in ear headphones cancel the noise and have good enough sound for my daily train rides . With all the noise in the background i wo n't enjoy the higher quality from the other headphones anyway . And i would hate to break my better headphones by accident while they are in my bag . Edit : And while i love listening to old guitar songs , concerts and things like that with my good headphones ( they 're like goosebumps guarantee for good songs ) i feel like most party / dance music really does n't do to well with good speakers ... you really start to notice cheap effects and it just makes some songs unenjoyable for me , not sure if anyone else has noticed the same .

    "question": "open vs closed back headphones . What are the advantages and disadvantages for them and which ones are used for what ? Edit : thanks to everyone who took the time . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Open-back headphones have a design where the ear cups are not sealed and allow sound to pass through them. This can give a more natural and open sound, as if you are listening to speakers in a room rather than headphones on your head. The sound from open-back headphones may also be more spacious and have a wider soundstage, which can be beneficial for certain types of music and audio recording. \nOn the other hand, closed-back headphones have a design where the ear cups are sealed and do not allow sound to pass through them. This can provide a more isolated listening experience and can be helpful for blocking out external noise. Closed-back headphones are often preferred for noisy environments or for use in situations where you do not want others to hear what you are listening to. They are also often used for monitoring in recording studios, as they can help to prevent sound leakage into microphones. \nBoth open-back and closed-back headphones have their own advantages and disadvantages, and which one is best for you will depend on your specific needs and preferences. Some people prefer open-back headphones for their natural sound, while others prefer closed-back headphones for their isolation and ability to block out external noise. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference and the specific use case.",

    "answer": "Semen is a fluid that is produced by the male reproductive system. It is made up of a mixture of different substances, including sperm cells, proteins, sugars, and other substances. The sperm cells are what give semen its white color. \nWhen semen is first produced, it is a thick, white fluid. However, after a few minutes, it begins to thin out and change color. This is because the proteins and sugars in semen start to break down, which causes the fluid to thin out and become less white. \nIt's also important to note that the color of semen can vary slightly from person to person, and it can also be affected by factors such as diet, medications, and overall health. Some people may have semen that is more yellow or grey in color, while others may have semen that is more white. \nSo, in short, semen is white because it contains sperm cells, but it may not stay white for very long because the proteins and sugars in it can break down and cause it to change color.",

    "answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help explain this to you! \nFirst, let's talk about what fractions are. A fraction is a way of representing a part of a whole. For example, if you have a pie and you cut it into three equal pieces, each piece is 1/3 of the pie. That means that 1/3 is equal to one of those three pieces of pie. \nNow, let's talk about decimals. A decimal is another way of representing a part of a whole. Instead of using fractions, we use numbers that are less than one, like 0.1 or 0.5. For example, if you have $1 and you want to represent one-third of that as a decimal, you would divide 1 by 3 to get 0.33333333 (and so on). \nNow, let's talk about how we can turn a fraction into a decimal. To do this, we can divide the number on the top (also called the numerator) by the number on the bottom (also called the denominator). For example, let's say we have the fraction 3/3. If we divide 3 by 3, we get 1. That means that 3/3 is equal to 1. \nNow, let's say we have the fraction 3/3 as a decimal. If we divide 3 by 3, we get 0.999999 (and so on). But that's not quite right, because we want to represent 3/3 as a whole number. To do that, we need to put a decimal point and a zero after the one, like this: 1.0000. That means that 3/3 as a decimal is equal to 1.0000, or just 1. \nSo to sum it up: 3/3 is equal to 1, and 3/3 as a decimal is equal to 1.0000. I hope that helps clarify things for you!",

    "answer": "Steel and wood can both feel cold to the touch because they are good conductors of heat. This means that they are able to transfer heat quickly from your skin to the object, making it feel colder to the touch. \nHowever, the fact that steel and wood feel differently when they are the same temperature does not have any evolutionary benefit for our species. It is simply a physical property of the materials. \nHuman evolution is driven by the adaptation of traits that help an organism survive and reproduce in its environment. These adaptations can be physical, such as the shape of a plant's leaves or the size of an animal's teeth, or they can be behavioral, such as the way an animal hunts for food or the way a plant disperses its seeds. \nThe fact that steel and wood feel differently when they are the same temperature does not have any direct impact on an organism's ability to survive or reproduce, so it is not something that would have played a role in human evolution.",

    "answer": "Toll roads are roads that charge a fee for vehicles to use them. When you pay a toll to get on a toll road, you are paying for the privilege of using the road for a certain distance. When you get off the toll road, you have finished using the road and you may be required to pay an additional fee to cover the cost of maintaining the road and providing the service of letting you use it. \nThink of it like paying for a ride on a bus or a train. When you get on the bus or train, you pay a fee to ride a certain distance. When you get off, you have finished using the service and you may be required to pay an additional fee to cover the cost of the ride. In the same way, when you pay a toll to get on a toll road, you are paying for the service of using the road for a certain distance. When you get off the toll road, you have finished using the service and you may be required to pay an additional fee to cover the cost of using the road.",

    "question": "Why do we close our eyes when we sleep ? In debth biology explanation :) Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "There are a few reasons why we close our eyes when we sleep. One reason is to protect our eyes from dust and other particles that might irritate them. When we are awake and our eyes are open, we blink to keep our eyes moist and to wash away any dirt or dust that might have gotten into them. However, when we are asleep, we don't blink as much, so closing our eyes helps to keep our eyes moist and protected. \nAnother reason we close our eyes when we sleep is to help our brain relax. When we are awake, our eyes are constantly sending signals to our brain about what we are seeing. These signals can be distracting and make it harder for us to relax and fall asleep. By closing our eyes, we block out these signals and give our brain a chance to rest and recharge. \nFinally, closing our eyes can help us to feel more comfortable and cozy when we are sleeping. It can be nice to have a sense of darkness and privacy when we are in bed, and closing our eyes helps to create this feeling. \nSo, to summarize, we close our eyes when we sleep to protect our eyes, to help our brain relax, and to feel more comfortable and cozy.",

    "answer": "From what I understand , the team that executed the raid were specifically chosen because of their recent operational experience in Afghanistan , and they had first hand Pakistan cross border experience . On top of that , as soon as they arrived in the states from their most recent mission , they were able to be secreted to an airbase to immediately commence their mission specific training for the operation without anyone noticing . Also , the planners put in charge for the operation were previous DEVGRU ( Seal 6 ) members .

    "answer": "The SEALs (which stands for SEa, Air, and Land) are a special operations force of the United States Navy. They are trained to conduct a variety of missions, including amphibious assaults, reconnaissance, and counter-terrorism operations. \nOsama bin Laden was the leader of a terrorist group called al-Qaeda, which was responsible for the September 11th attacks on the United States in 2001. The U.S. government believed that bin Laden was hiding in a compound in Pakistan, and so they sent in the SEALs to capture or kill him. \nThe SEALs are just one of many special forces units that are trained to conduct operations like this. Other units, such as the Army Rangers and Delta Force, also have the skills and training necessary to carry out similar missions. In this case, the SEALs were chosen because they had the specific training and experience needed to carry out the operation successfully.",

    "answer": "The iPhone uses a proprietary connector called a Lightning connector, rather than the micro-USB connector that is used by many other devices. Apple has used the Lightning connector since 2012, when it replaced the older 30-pin connector that was previously used on the iPhone. \nThere are a few reasons why Apple decided to use the Lightning connector instead of micro-USB. One reason is that the Lightning connector is smaller and more compact than micro-USB, which allows it to be used on devices with smaller form factors, such as the iPhone. Additionally, the Lightning connector is reversible, which means it can be plugged in either way, making it easier to use. \nAnother reason is that the Lightning connector is able to transmit data as well as power, which means that it can be used to connect devices to a computer for transferring files, or to connect to other devices for things like audio or video output. The micro-USB connector is primarily designed for charging and does not have this capability. \nOverall, the decision to use the Lightning connector was made by Apple in order to give them more control over the design and functionality of their devices, and to offer features that are not possible with micro-USB.",

    "answer": "Honey does not spoil in the sense that it will not rot or go bad in the same way that many other food products do. However, honey can still change over time, and the expiration date on the bottle is there to give you an idea of how long the honey is likely to remain at its best quality. \nHoney is made up of simple sugars, which means that it is relatively stable and does not provide much in the way of food for bacteria or other microorganisms. This is why honey can last for such a long time without spoiling. \nHowever, honey can still change in other ways. For example, it can crystallize or thicken over time, and the flavor and color of honey can also change. These changes are generally not harmful, but they can affect the quality and taste of the honey. \nThe expiration date on the bottle is there to give you an idea of how long the honey is likely to remain at its best quality. After the expiration date, the honey may still be safe to eat, but it may not taste or look as good as it did when it was first bottled. If you have tasted honey past the expiration date on the bottle and noticed a strange taste, it is likely that the honey has changed in some way and is no longer at its best quality.",

    "answer": "Most electronic devices, including cell phones, use lithium-ion batteries, which have a built-in mechanism for keeping track of their charge level. Inside the battery, there are tiny electrical components called \"charge coulometers\" that keep track of the amount of charge going in and out of the battery. \nWhen the battery is being charged, the coulometers measure the amount of charge going into the battery and store this information. When the battery is being used to power the device, the coulometers measure the amount of charge being used and update the stored information accordingly. \nThe device's battery meter then uses this stored information to display the current charge level on the device's screen. So, the battery doesn't actually \"put off\" more energy when it is full. Instead, it is the coulometers inside the battery that keep track of the charge level and let the device know how much battery life is left.",

    "answer": "When you exercise, your body uses stored energy in the form of fat to fuel your muscles. Your body has a limited amount of energy stored in the form of glycogen (a type of carbohydrate) in your muscles and liver, and when that runs out, it turns to fat as an energy source. \nHere's how it works: \n1. When you start exercising, your body breaks down glycogen stored in your muscles and liver into glucose (a type of sugar) to use for energy. \n2. As you continue to exercise, your body uses up more and more glycogen and starts to use fat as an energy source. \n3. When your body uses fat for energy, it breaks down the fat molecules into smaller parts, including glycerol and fatty acids. \n4. The glycerol and fatty acids are then taken to your cells, where they are used to produce energy through a process called cellular respiration. \n5. During cellular respiration, oxygen is used to convert the glycerol and fatty acids into energy, and carbon dioxide (CO2) and water are produced as byproducts. \n6. The CO2 is expelled from your body when you breathe out, and the water is expelled through urine and sweat. \nSo, to answer your question, when you exercise, your body burns fat by using it for energy and releasing the byproducts (CO2 and water) through your breath, urine, and sweat.",

    "answer": "URL_0 is likely using a technique called mirroring to remain online. Mirroring involves copying the content of a website and hosting it on a different server, so that the website can still be accessed even if the original server is seized or taken offline. This can be done for a variety of reasons, including to bypass censorship or to keep a website available to users even if the original server is experiencing technical issues. \nIt's also possible that URL_0 is using a decentralized network, such as the BitTorrent protocol, to host and distribute its content. In this case, the website's content would be distributed across a large number of computers, rather than being stored on a single server. This makes it more difficult for authorities to take the website offline, as there is no central point of control to target. \nIt's important to note that downloading or sharing copyrighted material, such as movies or music, without the permission of the copyright holder is illegal in many countries. Websites that offer unauthorized downloads of copyrighted material are often targeted by law enforcement agencies and may be subject to legal action.",

    "answer": "Train wheels are often made of metal because metal is strong and durable, and it can withstand the weight and forces involved in carrying a train. Metal is also a good conductor of electricity, which is important for trains that run on electric power. \nThere are a few reasons why train wheels are not made from a material with more friction, like rubber. First, rubber is not as strong as metal, so it might not be able to support the weight of the train as well. Second, rubber can wear out more quickly than metal, so it might need to be replaced more often. Finally, rubber is not a good conductor of electricity, so it would not be suitable for use on electric trains. \nOverall, the use of metal wheels on metal tracks is a very efficient and effective solution for trains. While rubber or other materials with more friction might provide some additional benefits in certain situations, they also come with their own set of challenges and drawbacks.",

    "answer": "Great question! Lenses are round because that's the shape that allows them to focus light onto the camera sensor in the most efficient way. A lens works by bending light as it passes through it, and a round shape is particularly good at doing this evenly across the entire image. \nThe camera sensor, on the other hand, is typically rectangular because it is more efficient to use all the space available on the sensor to capture the image. A rectangular sensor can capture a wider field of view than a square sensor of the same size, so it is able to capture more of the scene in a single photograph. \nWhen you look through the viewfinder of an SLR camera, you are looking through the lens itself, which is why the image appears round. But when you take a picture, the rectangular sensor captures the image that the lens is projecting onto it, resulting in a rectangular photograph. \nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

    "question": "How come my Vitamin C tablets have 1250 % of the recommended daily allowance of Vitamin C ? Seems like overkill ... Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "A couple reasons . First , a lot is wasted and is n't actually utilized in the body . Acids or other microbes can use it up too , so you do n't get the full about found in a pill . They overload your body with it so your body gets 100 % ( or at least close ) of the vitamins suggested daily . Second , your body ca n't utilize so much if it does n't need it . So again they overload your system , so as the vitamins pass in your intestines and uses up those vitamins normally , there 's an excess to refill what your body uses throughout the day .",

    "question": "How come my Vitamin C tablets have 1250 % of the recommended daily allowance of Vitamin C ? Seems like overkill ... Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The recommended daily allowance (RDA) of Vitamin C is the amount of Vitamin C that is considered sufficient for meeting the nutritional needs of most people. This amount can vary depending on a person's age, gender, and other factors. \nVitamin C tablets are often labeled with the percentage of the RDA that a single tablet contains. So, if your Vitamin C tablets have 1250% of the RDA, it means that a single tablet contains 12.5 times the RDA of Vitamin C. This does seem like a lot, but it's important to remember that the RDA is just a guideline and that different people have different Vitamin C needs. Some people may need more Vitamin C than the RDA, while others may need less. \nIt's also worth noting that it is generally safe to take high doses of Vitamin C, as the body can easily excrete any excess through the urine. However, it is always a good idea to talk to a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen to make sure it is safe and appropriate for you.",

    "answer": "Water damage can cause a number of problems with electronic devices such as phones and laptops. When water gets inside the device, it can cause short circuits, which are electrical connections that happen unexpectedly. These short circuits can cause the device to stop working or function improperly. \nWater can also cause corrosion, which is when the metal parts of the device start to break down and deteriorate. This can make the device stop working properly, or even completely stop working. \nAdditionally, water can cause the device to rust, which is when the metal parts start to turn red and become covered in a reddish-brown substance. Rust can also cause the device to stop working properly or stop working altogether. \nFinally, water can cause the device to malfunction or stop working if it gets into the device's hardware, such as the motherboard or other important components. These components are responsible for controlling the device's functions, and if they become damaged by water, the device may stop working.",

    "question": "Why do people disagree with stem cell research ? am i missing something here ? ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Two reasons : 1 ) Often because their understanding is poor , and scientists often do a horrible job of explaining . Many people think embryonic stem cells from abortions , which is incorrect . In fact they come in - vitro fertilisation ( i.e. artificially injecting donated eggs with sperm ) . When couples go for IVF , because they can not conceive naturally scientists fertilise several eggs ( usually around 20 ) in a dish . Obviously nobody wants to be implanted with 20 fertilised eggs , so there are spares left over . They would either go in the bin , or they can be used for research . That 's where scientists get their stem cells from . Embryonic stem cells are only present during very early stages after the sperm fertilises the egg . This is called the blastocyst . If this was taking place inside a woman , she would NOT be pregnant at this stage . A woman is only pregnant after the fertilised egg implants into the uterus wall . Thus , embryonic stem cells are not in any way related to abortions . 2 ) Technically , a fertilised egg * could * be considered as the start of life . The egg carries one set of chromosomes ( 23 ) , and the sperm carries the other ( 23 ) . So when fertilisation takes place and the chromosomes combine ( giving you 2x 23 chromosomes ) and the cell divides , this technically is a brand new combination - an individual - i.e. all of the genetic instructions required create a unique human being . So it 's fair to say that by harvesting stem cells ( thus destroying that embryo ) , you are removing all potential for life . However , it 's worth saying that without implanting into the uterus wall , development into a foetus would never have been possible . So IMO there is one ridiculous argument , and one realistic one .",

Some people disagree with stem cell research because they have ethical concerns about how the stem cells are obtained. \nOne way to obtain stem cells is to use cells that are taken from a developing embryo, which is a very early stage of human development. Some people believe that destroying an embryo to obtain stem cells is wrong because they believe that an embryo is a human life and should not be destroyed. \nOther people disagree with stem cell research because they have concerns about the safety of the research. They may be worried that using stem cells to treat diseases could have unintended consequences or could lead to serious health problems. \nOverall, the disagreement with stem cell research comes down to different beliefs and values about the importance of human life and the potential risks and benefits of scientific research.",

    "answer": "Lightning is caused by the buildup of static electricity in the clouds. This can occur during a snowstorm, but it is less common because snow is made up of small, lightweight ice crystals that do not produce as much static electricity as other types of precipitation, such as rain or hail. \nWhen it is cold and dry outside, the air is less able to hold moisture, which can cause snowflakes to form. As these snowflakes fall through the air, they rub against each other and can build up a static charge. However, this charge is not strong enough to produce lightning, which requires a much larger buildup of static electricity. \nIn contrast, rain and hail are made up of larger, heavier water droplets that are more effective at producing static electricity. When it is warm and humid outside, the air can hold more moisture, which can cause rain and hail to form. These larger water droplets are more effective at rubbing against each other and building up a static charge, which can lead to lightning. \nSo, while it is possible for lightning to occur during a snowstorm, it is less common because snow is not as effective at producing static electricity as other types of precipitation.",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why people eat raw fish, but not raw meat from other animals. \nOne reason is that raw fish is often prepared in a way that is safe to eat, while raw meat from other animals can contain harmful bacteria or parasites that can make you sick. Fish that is used for raw dishes like sushi and sashimi is carefully handled and prepared to reduce the risk of contamination. \nAnother reason is that some types of fish, like tuna and salmon, contain a naturally occurring enzyme that helps to break down the proteins in the fish. This makes it easier for the body to digest the raw fish and reduces the risk of food poisoning. \nFinally, some people simply prefer the taste and texture of raw fish to that of raw meat from other animals. It is a matter of personal preference. \nIt's important to note that not all fish is safe to eat raw, and it is important to handle and prepare raw fish properly to reduce the risk of food poisoning.",

    "answer": "In the context of the TV show \"The Walking Dead,\" it is not accurate to say that jamming a hollow object through a person with a punctured lung would save their lives. In real life, a punctured lung, also known as a pneumothorax, is a serious medical condition that occurs when air escapes from the lung and builds up in the space between the lung and the chest wall. This can cause the lung to collapse and make it difficult for the person to breathe. \nTo treat a punctured lung, a doctor would typically use a needle or small tube to remove the excess air from the chest cavity. This can help to re-expand the collapsed lung and allow the person to breathe more easily. In some cases, a larger tube may be inserted through a small incision in the chest to keep the lung expanded until it can heal. \nIt is important to seek medical treatment as soon as possible if you or someone you know has a punctured lung. Prompt treatment can help to prevent further complications and improve the chances of a full recovery.",

    "answer": "The terms \"first degree\" and \"third degree\" are used to describe the severity of different types of injuries. They are not used to describe the severity of crimes. \nIn the context of burns, \"first degree burns\" are the least severe. They usually affect only the outer layer of skin and cause redness, pain, and swelling. \"Second degree burns\" are more severe and affect the outer layer of skin and the layer underneath. They can cause blistering and are more painful than first degree burns. \"Third degree burns\" are the most severe. They damage all layers of the skin and can even damage the tissues underneath. Third degree burns can be very serious and require medical attention. \nIn the context of murder, \"first degree murder\" is considered the most serious because it involves premeditation and planning. It is the intentional and premeditated killing of another person. \"Second degree murder\" is also a serious crime, but it does not involve the same level of planning and intent as first degree murder. It is the intentional killing of another person, but without premeditation. \"Third degree murder\" is generally considered the least serious of the three degrees of murder. It is the unintentional killing of another person while committing a non-violent crime. \nSo, the terms \"first degree\" and \"third degree\" are used to describe different levels of severity, but they are used in opposite ways depending on the context.",

    "question": "Why do n't US citizens vote directly on all legislation ? In lieu of voting for people who may or may not vote on the voter 's behalf . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Most of it is historical reasoning : America was founded as a representative democracy , primarily because the Founding Fathers did n't exactly trust the general public on being educated enough on every issue to vote . So they trusted them to vote on representatives who shared similar views , but would be educated enough to actually know what 's best . Those representatives are then the ones who directly vote for laws . Second reasoning is also important : under what system would people vote directly on laws ? Switzerland does it , more or less , because their country is the size of postage stamp ( apologies to any Swiss people ) compared to the United States . This was more or less impossible for the better part of American history , considering the founding of America predated the internet , or even telegraph lines .

Though this is likely not a hugely significant factor either , I personally prefer non - dangerous \" artificial \" pesticides in my food over potentially sickness - inducing \" natural \" bacteria . With that said , a lot of it is a marketing scheme . However , there are some benefits to organic food . None of it comes from \" eating \" it , but by supporting organic food businesses , you are also supporting smaller farming businesses . These smaller farms often treat their animals better ( though not necessarily always ) and leave less of a footprint on the environment . However , the resulting product is often more expensive as well , in addition to the things mentioned above . On the front of GMOs which are generally not considered organic , no \u2014 there is no benefit to eating non - genetically modified foods . In fact , one could easily make the argument that GMOs are a very good thing , as they not only decrease the costs of food but also improve the quality of the food , making it larger and more disease - resistant . Neither of these are bad things , contrary to what non - GMO purists would argue . However , the major con to GMOs is that they often leave a larger footprint on the environment due to how they are grown . If a genetically - modified crop is engineered to be resistant to a certain pesticide , a farmer can be expected to use more of that pesticide to keep their crops safe . This can be detrimental to the local environment . However , some GMOs have been engineered to have a beneficial , opposite effect .

    "answer": "A PC cleanup is a process that involves removing unnecessary files and programs from your computer to free up storage space and improve its performance. Here are the steps that are typically involved in a standard PC cleaning: \n1. Uninstalling unnecessary programs: You can go to the \"Control Panel\" on your PC and look for programs that you no longer use or need. You can then select these programs and uninstall them to free up space on your hard drive. \n2. Removing temporary files: Temporary files are created by your operating system and various programs when they run. These files are not needed after the program has finished running, and they can take up a lot of space on your hard drive. You can use the \"Disk Cleanup\" tool on your PC to remove these temporary files. \n3. Emptying the recycle bin: The recycle bin is a folder on your computer where deleted files are stored until you decide to permanently delete them. Emptying the recycle bin will free up more space on your hard drive. \n4. Defragmenting your hard drive: When you use your computer, the data on your hard drive gets scattered across different locations. Defragmenting your hard drive involves organizing the data so that it is stored in a more efficient way, which can improve the performance of your computer. \n5. Updating your operating system: Keeping your operating system up to date can help fix any bugs or security vulnerabilities and improve the overall performance of your computer. \n6.

    "question": "Why have humans evolved so far as to lose their thick coats but still grow hair on their heads and faces ? What purpose does it have ? Just confused as to why we all still grow hair if it does n't really do anything . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "In short because as humans evolved from arboreal dwelling primates to plains dwelling proto humans it was more important to keep cool , and since we sweat to keep cool those who were less hairy tended to cool off better and hence survive better to pass on the less hairy genes . Hair on the top of the head remained because it was likely an effective sun block , and pubic hair probably had some part in sexual attraction or scent retention . Humans in this environment had dark skin pigmentation that evolved as a natural sun block as hair was lost . Once humans began expanding to cooler climates they had learned to use animal skins , and hairy individuals did n't survive any better than less hairy ones , so humans who moved to cold climates did n't have to be hairy to pass on their genes . Edit : Also around 10,000 years ago , give or take , humans in colder climates who 's skin had less pigmentation were more able to make use the decreased sunlight , and eventually the lighter skin became the predominate skin tone in these climates .",

    "question": "Why have humans evolved so far as to lose their thick coats but still grow hair on their heads and faces ? What purpose does it have ? Just confused as to why we all still grow hair if it does n't really do anything . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Human beings have evolved over many thousands of years, and the way our bodies look and function today is the result of a long process of natural selection. Natural selection is a process that occurs in nature where organisms that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, this can lead to changes in the way that a species looks and functions. \nOne of the ways that human beings have adapted to their environment is by losing the thick coat of fur that many other mammals have. This may have happened because human beings developed the ability to make and wear clothing, which provided protection from the elements and allowed them to live in a wider range of environments. \nAt the same time, human beings still have hair on their heads and faces. This hair serves several purposes. For example, the hair on our heads helps to keep us warm and provides some protection from the sun. The hair on our faces, particularly in men, may have evolved to signal social and sexual maturity, as well as to protect the face from injury. \nSo, in short, the reason why human beings have evolved to lose their thick coats but still grow hair on their heads and faces is because these features have helped us to adapt to our environment and survive as a species.",

    "question": "How do people in Urban societies in the Midwest , Northeast , South and West coast all have very similar accents / dialects . Most black guys I know from Atlanta and New York sound just like me . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "In the modern society , a lot of dialect becomes a result of broader influences than just your immediate geographical surroundings . Television has standardized quite a few American dialects . Most Americans watch network television which tends to use fairly standard dialects depending on their characters . The standard media dialect , the type of dialect that people often refer to as \" not having an accent \" is very much reinforced in formal broadcasts like news programs . This dialect is prevalent in the the midwest and west coast anyway , so there 's a lot of it around . Entertainment television and movies default to this dialect , too , but they 'll have characters that they want to express a different regional identity , so they 'll cast someone who has or can imitate a regional dialect , like for the movie \" The Departed \" where several of the actors had Boston accents ( some more successfully than others ) . If you wanted to cast some one for a character that 's from the south , you 'd likely have them use a southern accent , etc . [ edit ] and to answer you question in regards to urban areas , they 're the places that usually experience the most influence from television / movies / social media and which have the biggest mix of dialects , so someone living / growing up in an urban environment is more likely to end up with a standard dialect than any other particular one . [ edit 2]and the African American dialect is particularly standardized . There is less variation among African American speakers than among almost any other major demographic .",

    "answer": "There are several reasons why people in different parts of the United States may have similar accents or dialects. \nFirst, language tends to evolve and change over time, and people who live in close proximity to one another are more likely to influence each other's way of speaking. This means that if two people live near each other and interact frequently, they may begin to adopt similar ways of speaking. \nSecond, people who move to a new place may adopt the accent or dialect of the people they live and interact with. This is especially true for people who move to a new place during their formative years, when they are still learning how to speak. \nFinally, media and technology have made it easier for people to hear and learn about different accents and dialects from all over the country. This means that someone who grows up in the Midwest may be exposed to the way people speak in the Northeast or West Coast, and vice versa. \nOverall, there are many factors that contribute to the similarities in accents and dialects that we see in different parts of the United States.",

    "answer": "There are many reasons why a country might perform differently in the Olympics, and it is not necessarily related to the size of the population. For example, China has a long history of success in the Olympics, especially in sports like gymnastics, diving, and table tennis. The country has a strong system of sports training and development, with many athletes receiving specialized coaching and support from a young age. \nIndia, on the other hand, has not traditionally had as strong a presence in the Olympics. There are a number of factors that may contribute to this, including a lack of funding and support for athletes, a lack of access to high-quality training facilities and coaching, and a lack of emphasis on sports in the education system. \nIt is also important to note that the Olympics are a global competition and there are many countries with smaller populations that have had success in the games. For example, countries like Jamaica, Norway, and New Zealand have all won multiple medals in the Olympics, even though they have much smaller populations than India or China. \nUltimately, success in the Olympics depends on many different factors, including the quality of the athletes, the resources available to support them, and the culture and values of the country.",

The anus has a high concentration of nerve endings and is surrounded by muscles that can be stimulated during anal sex. When these nerve endings and muscles are stimulated, they can produce a feeling of pleasure. \nIt's also important to note that people's bodies and sexual preferences are different, so what feels good and enjoyable to one person may not be the same for another.

    "answer": "Vaccines are made up of a few different ingredients that are combined to help prevent diseases. Here are some of the common ingredients you might find in a vaccine, and what they do: \n1. Antigens: These are the parts of the virus or bacteria that the vaccine is designed to protect against. The vaccine will contain a small amount of the virus or bacteria, or a part of it, to help your body build immunity to it. \n2. Adjuvants: These are substances that are added to the vaccine to help boost your body's response to the vaccine. They help your body create more antibodies, which are proteins that help fight off infections. \n3. Preservatives: These are added to the vaccine to help prevent contamination and keep the vaccine safe for use. One common preservative is thimerosal, which contains mercury. However, it is important to note that the mercury in thimerosal is in a form that is not harmful to humans. \n4. Stabilizers: These are added to the vaccine to help keep it stable and effective over time. \n5. Inactivating agents: These are added to vaccines made from viruses to help kill the virus so it can't cause disease. \nIt's important to note that vaccines do not contain any whole, viable viruses or bacteria, and they do not contain any fetal tissue. Vaccines are rigorously tested and are safe and effective at preventing diseases. They have saved countless lives and are an important tool in public health.",

    "answer": "In many religions, God is traditionally depicted as male because the language used to refer to God is often male. This is because these religions tend to use gendered language, and the male gender is often used to refer to people or things that are seen as powerful or superior. This is a cultural and linguistic tradition, rather than a religious one. \nSome people believe that God is beyond gender and cannot be accurately described with human gender categories. Others argue that God is male because God is the creator and sustainer of the universe, and these are traditionally male roles in many cultures. \nIt's important to note that not all religions depict God as male. Some religions, such as Hinduism and Wicca, depict God as both male and female, or as having both masculine and feminine qualities. And some religions, such as Buddhism and Taoism, do not depict God as having a gender at all. \nIn modern times, some theologists and scholars have questioned the traditional depiction of God as male and have argued that it is important to recognize the diversity and complexity of the divine.

Banks are required to report deposits of cash that are over $10,000 to the government.

If you have a legitimate reason for doing so, such as receiving a large inheritance or selling a piece of property, you can deposit as much cash as you like. \nIt is generally a good idea to spread large deposits over time rather than making a single large deposit. This is because large deposits may be scrutinized more closely by the bank and could potentially trigger an investigation. By making smaller deposits over a longer period of time, you can avoid drawing unnecessary attention to yourself. \nIn general, it is a good idea to keep your deposits under $10,000 to avoid any potential issues.

It was also easier to match with other beige office equipment, like printers and fax machines. \nThere are a few reasons why beige was a popular choice for computers. One reason is that beige is a relatively neutral color, so it can go well with a variety of other colors and decor styles. Additionally, beige is a softer and less vibrant color, which may have made the computer look more professional and business-like. \nAnother reason that beige was popular for computers is that it was easier to manufacture. Beige plastic was readily available and could be molded into the various shapes and sizes needed for computer cases. This made it a more cost-effective choice for manufacturers. \nWhite computers were not as common in the 1980s and 1990s because white plastic was more difficult to mold and not as readily available as beige. It was also more prone to yellowing over time, which could make the computer look old and outdated.

    "question": "Why did we choose 360 degrees to represent a circle ? A circle can be infinitely divided . Why not 100 ? 1000 ? 400 even -- 100 degrees per quadrant . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The 360 degree system for measuring angles is based on the idea that a circle can be divided into 360 equal parts. Each of these parts is called a degree, and they are used to measure angles. \nOne reason that 360 degrees was chosen as the number of parts to divide a circle into is that it is a highly composite number, which means that it can be evenly divided by many smaller numbers. For example, 360 can be divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 60, 72, 90, 120, 180, and 360. This makes it easier to do calculations involving angles, because the degree measurements can be divided and multiplied by these smaller numbers. \nAnother reason for using 360 degrees to measure angles is that it allows for a lot of precision. Dividing a circle into 100 parts, for example, would not allow for as much precision in measuring angles as dividing it into 360 parts would. Similarly, dividing a circle into 400 or 1000 parts would not be as useful, because these numbers are not as easily divisible by smaller numbers. \nOverall, the choice to use 360 degrees to measure angles is a practical one that has stood the test of time. It allows for a good balance of precision and ease of calculation.",

    "question": "If bourbon takes at least 8 - 10 years to mature , how can distilleries increase production this year ? Apparently there 's a bourbon shortage . What can distilleries actually do ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Bourbon is a type of whiskey that is made from a mixture of grains, including at least 51% corn, and aged in oak barrels for at least two years. While it is true that some bourbon can take longer to mature, especially if it is aged for a longer period of time or if it is made using a higher-quality recipe, there are a few things that distilleries can do to increase production in the short term. \nOne thing that distilleries can do is to increase the number of barrels they are producing. This can be done by increasing the number of barrels that are being filled each day, or by increasing the overall capacity of the distillery. \nAnother option is to use younger barrels for aging. While older barrels can contribute more complex flavors to the bourbon, younger barrels can still produce a good quality product in a shorter amount of time. \nDistilleries can also blend different bourbons of different ages to create a consistent flavor profile. This allows them to produce more bourbon in the short term while still maintaining a high quality product. \nFinally, distilleries can also release \"small batch\" or \"limited edition\" bourbons that are made using a higher-quality recipe and aged for a longer period of time. These bourbons may not be as widely available as the distillery's regular offerings, but they can still help to meet the demand for bourbon.",

    "question": "What 's so great about an Ivy League school versus a state school ? Besides the fact that Ivy League schools are older . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "At an Ivy League schools students are rubbing shoulders with other future movers and shakers . They will have connections in Washington , Wall Street , Silicon Valley , and academia that would n't be necessarily made at Chico State or community college . In addition , graduates of these schools make more money which they give back to these schools to ensure that they continue to have the best facilities . These facilities ( in addition to the traditions of Ivy League institutions ) ensure the best professors are doing the best research there . The education is also generally considered more demanding and specialized , these institutions have reputations to maintain , and they would not keep them if they were n't giving their students the best possible training in their fields .

    "question": "What 's so great about an Ivy League school versus a state school ? Besides the fact that Ivy League schools are older . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Ivy League schools are considered to be some of the most prestigious universities in the United States. They are known for their strong academic programs, distinguished faculty, and successful graduates. These schools tend to have smaller class sizes, more resources, and a greater emphasis on research than many state schools. \nOne of the main reasons that Ivy League schools are considered so prestigious is because they have very selective admissions processes. This means that only a small percentage of students who apply are accepted, which makes it difficult to get in. As a result, students who attend Ivy League schools are often among the most talented and motivated in the country. \nState schools, on the other hand, are publicly funded institutions that are open to anyone who meets their admissions requirements. They tend to have larger class sizes and may not have as many resources as Ivy League schools, but they can still offer a high-quality education. Some state schools are also very prestigious and competitive, and many students who attend these schools go on to successful careers. \nIn summary, Ivy League schools are known for their prestige, strong academics, and selective admissions processes, while state schools are generally more accessible and may not have as many resources. Both types of schools can provide a good education, and the choice between them ultimately depends on the individual student's needs and goals.",

    "answer": "There are many potential dangers associated with artificial intelligence (AI), and it is important to consider these risks as we develop and use AI technology. \nOne potential danger is that AI could be used to harm people. For example, if an AI system is used to control a military drone or a self-driving car, it could make decisions that result in injury or death. \nAnother potential danger is that AI could be used to spread misinformation or manipulate people. For example, an AI system could create fake news stories or social media posts that are designed to influence people's opinions or behavior. \nA third potential danger is that AI could lead to the loss of jobs. As AI systems become more advanced, they may be able to perform tasks that are currently done by humans. This could result in many people losing their jobs and potentially struggling to find new employment. \nA fourth potential danger is that AI could be used to violate people's privacy. For example, an AI system could be used to gather personal information about people without their knowledge or consent, and this information could be used for malicious purposes. \nOverall, it is important to carefully consider the potential risks and dangers associated with AI, and to take steps to mitigate these risks as we develop and use AI technology.",

It is more appropriate and respectful to say something like \"I value and appreciate people of all backgrounds and cultures\" or to simply express affection for an individual person rather than an entire group based on their ethnicity. \nIn general, it is important to be mindful of the impact of our words and actions on others, and to try to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or making assumptions about people based on their race or ethnicity.",

    "answer": "It is not healthy to drink only one glass of water per week. The human body needs a certain amount of water each day to function properly. Water is essential for many bodily functions, including maintaining the proper balance of bodily fluids, regulating body temperature, and helping to digestion and metabolism. When you don't get enough water, your body can become dehydrated, which can lead to a variety of health problems. \nIt is generally recommended that adults drink 8-12 cups (64-96 ounces) of water per day to stay hydrated. However, the exact amount of water you need can vary depending on factors such as your age, gender, weight, and activity level. It's important to listen to your body and drink water when you are thirsty, and to drink more water in hot or dry conditions or if you are exercising or engaging in other activities that make you sweat. \nIf you are only drinking one glass of water per week, it's important to increase your water intake to meet your body's needs. You can also get water from other sources, such as fruits and vegetables, as well as drinks like milk and juices. But it is important to drink enough plain water to stay properly hydrated.",

    "answer": "Old or damaged red blood cells are removed from circulation and replaced with new ones. When red blood cells are no longer able to function properly, they are removed from circulation by special cells called macrophages. Macrophages are found in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, and they are responsible for scavenging and removing old or damaged cells from the body. When a macrophage encounters a red blood cell that is no longer able to function properly, it engulfs the cell and breaks it down into its constituent parts. The macrophage then recycles these parts, using them to create new cells or to perform other important functions in the body. So, when an old red blood cell dies, it is removed from circulation and its parts are recycled by the body to be used again.",

    "answer": "Sitting in water for a long time can be dangerous and potentially lead to serious health problems, but it is not likely to directly kill you. \nTrench foot, which is a condition that can occur when the feet are wet and cold for an extended period of time, can cause numbness, tingling, and eventually, tissue death if left untreated. In severe cases, amputation of the affected limb may be necessary to prevent the spread of infection. However, trench foot itself is not usually life-threatening. \nIt is important to keep your body warm and dry, especially in cold weather. If you are sitting in water or your feet are wet and cold for an extended period of time, it is important to get out of the water and dry off as soon as possible to prevent trench foot and other problems. \nIt's also worth noting that sitting in contaminated water can also lead to other health problems, such as infections or illnesses caused by bacteria or parasites.

    "answer": "A normal body temperature is around 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). A fever is when your body temperature is higher than normal, usually because you are fighting off an infection or illness. A temperature of 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) is considered a high fever and can be dangerous if it lasts for a long time. \nOn the other hand, a body temperature of 36 degrees Celsius (96.8 degrees Fahrenheit) is lower than normal and is called hypothermia. Hypothermia can occur when your body loses heat faster than it can produce it, and it can be very dangerous because it can cause your body to stop functioning properly. For example, if your body temperature is too low, your heart and brain may not work correctly, and you may feel very tired or confused. \nSo, it is important to try to maintain a normal body temperature, and if you have a fever, it is important to try to bring your body temperature down to a normal level. If your body temperature is too low, it is important to try to warm up your body and bring it back to a normal temperature.",

    "answer": "It is generally illegal for politicians to accept bribes. A bribe is a payment or gift given to someone in a position of power in exchange for them doing something specific or for them not doing something that they are supposed to do. In many countries, it is a crime for politicians to accept bribes because it undermines the integrity of the political system and can lead to corruption. \nFor example, if a politician accepts a bribe from a company in exchange for supporting a particular piece of legislation, they may be breaking the law. This is because they are using their position of power to influence the outcome of a decision in a way that benefits the company that paid them the bribe, rather than acting in the best interests of the people they represent. \nIf a politician accepts a bribe and then does nothing in return, they may still be breaking the law because they are accepting something of value in exchange for the promise of doing something. Even if they do not follow through on the promise, the fact that they accepted the bribe can be illegal. \nIn short, it is generally illegal for politicians to accept bribes, and doing so can have serious consequences, including fines, imprisonment, and the loss of their job.",

    "question": "How come the sun does n't warm up Winter air even though the rays are still warm ? Always wondered how i can stand in the sun on a cold day and it 's rays still warm me up . Possible stupid question . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The sun's rays do still warm the air on a cold day, but the heat doesn't always reach the surface of the Earth because the Earth's atmosphere acts as a barrier. Some of the heat from the sun is absorbed by the atmosphere and then radiated back into space, while some of it is absorbed by the Earth's surface and then reradiated back into the atmosphere as infrared radiation. \nDuring the winter, the air is colder because the Earth is tilted on its axis, which means that the sun's rays are not as direct as they are during the summer. This can cause the heat from the sun to be less effective at warming the air. \nHowever, even on a cold day, you can still feel the warmth of the sun's rays because the sun is still emitting heat, and this heat can reach your skin and warm you up. So even though the air may not feel very warm, the sun's rays can still make you feel warm and comfortable.",

    "question": "Why did n't dinosaurs evolve to be inteligent but we did ? What was different back then ? I mean dinosaurs were here for 60 million years and we are here just for thousands . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Dinosaurs and humans evolved on Earth during different time periods, with dinosaurs existing much earlier than humans. Dinosaurs first appeared on Earth around 230 million years ago, while humans evolved much more recently, around 200,000 years ago. \nDuring the time that dinosaurs lived on Earth, the environment was very different than it is today. The planet was much warmer, and there were no mammals or birds. The dominant land animals were reptiles, including dinosaurs. \nOver time, dinosaurs evolved to be well-suited for their environment and the challenges they faced. Some dinosaurs were herbivores, or plant-eaters, and evolved to have strong jaws and teeth for grinding up plants. Other dinosaurs were carnivores, or meat-eaters, and evolved to have sharp teeth and claws for catching and killing prey. \nHowever, dinosaurs did not evolve to be intelligent in the same way that humans did. Intelligence in animals is often linked to the size of their brain relative to their body size, and the brains of most dinosaurs were relatively small compared to their body size. Humans, on the other hand, evolved to have relatively large brains compared to our body size, which has helped us to develop complex societies, technologies, and cultures. \nIt's important to remember that evolution is a process that takes place over millions of years, and it is influenced by a variety of factors, including the environment, the availability of resources, and the challenges that an animal must face in order to survive and reproduce. Different animals evolve different traits and abilities based on these factors, which is why some animals are more intelligent than others.",

    "answer": "When people drink alcohol, it can affect their brain and change the way they think and behave. Alcohol is a depressant, which means it slows down the central nervous system and can make people feel more relaxed and less inhibited. This can make it easier for people to say things they might not normally say when they are sober, or to show emotions they might normally try to hide. \nAlcohol can also affect the part of the brain that controls judgment and decision-making, which can make it harder for people to think clearly and make good decisions. This can lead to people saying or doing things that they might regret later. \nIt's important to remember that it's never okay to drink and drive, and that alcohol can also have serious negative effects on people's health if they drink too much. It's always a good idea to drink responsibly and to be aware of how alcohol might affect you.",

    "answer": "The moon reflects light from the sun, so it doesn't produce its own light or energy like the sun does. While it is possible to use the moon's light to generate electricity, it is not as practical as using the sun's light because the moon's light is much weaker. The moon is much farther away from the Earth than the sun, so the moon's light has to travel much farther to reach the Earth, which makes it weaker by the time it gets here. Additionally, the moon's light is only present at night, while the sun's light is present during the day, so it would be difficult to use the moon's light as a consistent source of energy. However, scientists and engineers are always looking for new ways to generate electricity, and some are working on ways to use the moon's light or other sources of energy to create electricity.",

    "answer": "Sure! English spelling can be a little confusing because it has evolved over time, and there are differences between British English and American English. \nOne of the main differences between British English and American English is the way that certain words are spelled. In British English, many words that end in \"-our\" are spelled with a \"u\", like \"colour,\" \"flavour,\" and \"behaviour.\" In American English, these same words are usually spelled without the \"u,\" so they would be spelled \"color,\" \"flavor,\" and \"behavior.\" \nThis difference in spelling comes from the fact that British English and American English have developed separately over time. The English language has changed and evolved since it was first spoken, and the way that words are spelled has changed as well. \nSo, to sum it up, the difference in spelling between British English and American English is just one of the many ways that the two versions of the language have developed differently over time.",

    "answer": "Capital cities are usually chosen by the government of a state, province, or country. There are several factors that can influence the decision of where to locate a capital city. \nOne factor is the size and population of the area. A capital city should be large enough to accommodate the needs of the government, including housing for government officials and space for government buildings and offices. \nAnother factor is the location of the capital city. It is often chosen to be in a central location within the state, province, or country, so that it is easily accessible to all parts of the region. \nSometimes, the capital city is chosen because it is already an important economic or cultural center. For example, London is the capital of the United Kingdom because it is a major financial and cultural center. \nIn some cases, the capital city may be changed by the government. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the government wants to move the capital to a more central location or if the current capital city becomes too small or unable to accommodate the needs of the government. \nOverall, the decision of where to locate a capital city is usually made by the government, and can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the size and population of the area, its location, and its importance as an economic or cultural center.",

    "answer": "Manufacturers often put stickers on their products that say that the warranty will be void if the sticker is removed. These stickers are usually put on products to let people know that the product has not been tampered with or opened by someone other than the manufacturer or a authorized repair technician. The stickers are meant to protect the manufacturer's interests by ensuring that any damage or problems with the product are not the result of someone other than the manufacturer or a authorized repair technician opening or tampering with the product. \nImagine that you bought a brand new phone, and a few weeks later it stopped working. You take it back to the store where you bought it and ask for a replacement or a refund, but the store tells you that the warranty is void because the sticker on the back of the phone has been removed. This might seem unfair, but the manufacturer is trying to protect itself from people who might try to claim that the product was defective when it was actually damaged or tampered with by someone else. \nSo, in short, manufacturers use these stickers to help protect their interests and ensure that they are not held responsible for any problems with the product that were not caused by them or an authorized repair technician.",

They are also relatively inexpensive and widely available, making them a good choice for parents and teachers. \nColored pencils are also a popular art supply, but they are generally considered to be more suitable for older children and adults. Colored pencils are made of pigments mixed with a binder, and they require a bit more skill and control to use than crayons. Colored pencils are often used for more detailed and precise coloring and drawing, whereas crayons are more suitable for broader strokes and filling in large areas. \nThat being said, there is no rule that says only small children can use crayons, and there is no reason why children of any age can't use colored pencils if they are interested in doing so.

    "question": "With Mt. Everest growing at a rate of two inches per year would the peak eventually reach space ? What are the limits on something like this ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, with a peak that reaches an elevation of about 29,029 feet (8,848 meters) above sea level. It is not actually growing in height, but rather, it is being uplifted by the movement of the Earth's crust. This process is called tectonic uplift, and it occurs when the Earth's plates collide and push against each other. \nAs for whether the peak of Mount Everest could eventually reach space, the answer is no. The Earth's atmosphere extends about 62 miles (100 kilometers) above the surface of the Earth, and the peak of Mount Everest is much shorter than that. Even if Mount Everest were to continue to be uplifted at a rate of two inches per year, it would take many thousands of years for it to reach the edge of the atmosphere. \nThere are also other factors that limit the height that a mountain can reach. For example, the weight of the mountain itself can cause it to sink down into the Earth's crust. Additionally, erosion caused by wind and water can gradually wear away at the mountain, causing it to become shorter over time. \nSo, to sum it up, Mount Everest is not going to grow tall enough to reach space. It is being uplifted by the movement of the Earth's plates, but there are other factors that limit its height and prevent it from growing indefinitely.",

If they don't have the gene for red hair, they won't have red hair. \nWhen a baby is born, it gets half of its genes from its mom and half from its dad. So if a mom and dad both have the gene for red hair, there is a good chance that their baby will also have red hair. But if only one parent has the gene for red hair, the baby might still have red hair, but it's not as likely. \nSo, to sum it up, a red head baby comes to be when it gets the gene for red hair from one or both of its parents.

They put a small amount of the food in the machine and burn it. The heat that is given off is measured, and from this, the number of calories in the food can be calculated. \nTo find out the amount of fat, protein, and other nutrients in a food, researchers use a process called proximate analysis. This involves using special chemicals to break down the food into its different parts, such as fat, protein, and carbohydrates. The amounts of these nutrients can then be measured. \nVitamin and mineral content can also be determined through laboratory testing. Researchers can use special equipment to measure the amounts of different vitamins and minerals in a food. \nOverall, finding out the information that goes on nutrition facts labels requires careful scientific research and testing.",

    "question": "Why is it mostly men who are colorblind ? I 'm Curious . I am a male who can see minute color differences but have many friends who ca n't tell red from blue . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Color blindness needs a 2 dominate alleles to become expressed in the person normally ( this is how it works with females ) but .. It is also a sex - linked trait . Males are missing the ' slot ' for that the color blindness allele in their Y chromosome , it can only be expressed in their X chromosome . Therefore if a male receives one dominate allele from their mother / father they will be color blind . This is why males tend to be colorblind more then females , you only need one dominate color - blindness allele to be color blind whereas a female needs 2 dominant alleles for it to be expressed in females ( because they have two X chromosomes ) . Really simple explanation and there is a lot more to it but hopefully this helps .",

    "question": "Why is it mostly men who are colorblind ? I 'm Curious . I am a male who can see minute color differences but have many friends who ca n't tell red from blue . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Color blindness is caused by a genetic variation that affects the way the brain processes certain colors. It is more common in males than females because the genetic variation responsible for color blindness is located on the X chromosome, which males only have one of (females have two X chromosomes). Because males only have one X chromosome, they are more likely to be affected by color blindness if they inherit the genetic variation from their mother. \nSo, to explain it like you're five: Color blindness is a special way that some people's brains see colors that is different from most people. Boys are more likely to be colorblind than girls because it is something that is passed down from their mother.",

    "answer": "Ear wax, also called cerumen, is a natural substance produced by the body to protect the ear. It helps to keep the ear clean and free of dirt, dust, and other foreign particles. Ear wax also has antimicrobial properties, which means it helps to prevent infections in the ear. \nThe ear canal is a tube that runs from the outer ear to the middle ear. Ear wax is produced by glands in the skin of the ear canal. As the wax moves from the inner ear to the outer ear, it helps to protect the ear by trapping dirt and other foreign particles. \nSo, ear wax serves an important purpose by helping to keep our ears clean and healthy. It's not an annoying byproduct of having an ear canal, but rather a natural and important part of the ear's anatomy.",

Some hackers attack systems for personal gain, such as to steal personal information or to sell that information to others. Other hackers attack systems as a form of protest or to disrupt services. Still, others do it for the challenge or to test their skills. \nIt is important to note that companies like Playstation are not necessarily targeted because they have done anything wrong. Instead, hackers may see the company as an attractive target because it is a well-known brand, has a large user base, or because the company's systems may be vulnerable to attack. \nIt is also important to remember that hacking is illegal and can have serious consequences for both the hackers and the companies and individuals that are targeted.",

    "question": "What mystic wood are electric poles made of , and how is that they never need to be replaced ? I 've literally never in my life seen a single one replaced . Boggles my mind . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "I worked for a utility in the department that was responsible for inspecting the wooden poles . Here 's how they test if the pole is still sturdy enough . First , they hit the pole with a hammer , listening to determine if it is hollow . Poles usually rot from the inside out . They then drill small holes in the pole near the ground . They stick a long hook inside and feel whether the wood is still hard or if it has started to rot . If so , they can also measure how much of the diameter is rotten . They then place drying agents in the holes they drilled and cap the holes with wooden plugs . The drying agents will absorb the moisture and slow down the rotting . As said before , the poles are treated with some kind of preservative before being installed . The wood is usually very dry so it has set . Hence , it wo n't warp much and wo n't be affected by rain and snow . Typically , poles will need to be replaced if they are physically broken : hit by a car , touched by a nearby fire , struck by lightning . In warmer climates , a big issue is insects . They will hollow out the pole and nest inside . Sometimes , it 's hard to actually notice because the outside wood looks fine . A pole that was properly prepared before installation and that had an easy life ( no rotting , no insects , not hit by a snow plow ) can last up to 100 years ( we 've seen a few of them during our inspections ) .",

    "answer": "Electric poles are typically made of wood, steel, or concrete. The material used for an electric pole depends on the location and the purpose of the pole. \nWooden electric poles are made from trees that are specifically grown for use in the construction of poles. These trees are chosen for their straightness and strength, and they are treated with preservatives to make them more resistant to rot and insects. \nSteel electric poles are made from rolled steel, which is a type of metal that is formed into a long, thin strip and then wound into a cylinder. Steel poles are very strong and durable, but they are also more expensive than wooden poles. \nConcrete electric poles are made from a mixture of cement, water, and aggregate, such as sand and gravel. Concrete poles are very strong and durable, but they are also more expensive than wooden or steel poles. \nElectric poles are designed to be long-lasting and able to withstand extreme weather conditions. However, they can still be damaged by storms, lightning, or other events, which may require them to be repaired or replaced. In general, electric poles are inspected regularly to ensure that they are in good condition, and any necessary repairs or replacements are made as needed.",

    "answer": "The energy that keeps the planets moving in their orbits around the Sun, as well as rotating on their axes, comes from the energy that was released when the solar system formed. This energy has been conserved and is being used to keep the planets moving. There is no indication that this energy will run out anytime soon, so it is unlikely that the planets will stop moving. \nThink of it like a spinning top. When you first spin the top, it has a lot of energy and moves very fast. As it spins, it slows down and eventually stops. The energy that was used to spin the top is still there, but it is being used to overcome the force of friction, which slows the top down. The planets work in a similar way, with the energy they have being used to overcome the force of gravity, which is what keeps them in orbit around the Sun. \nSo, to answer your question, the planets will not stop moving because they have a lot of energy that is being used to keep them moving, and there is no reason to think that this energy will run out anytime soon.",

    "question": "How do captcha systems prevent spam ? Why has no one created a system of spamming around them ? What makes them so much harder to break then normal spam filters ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Captcha systems are designed to prevent spam by requiring users to prove that they are human. This is usually done by showing the user an image with distorted text or a series of images with a specific pattern and asking them to enter the text or select the images that match the pattern. \nSpammers might try to use automated programs to send out large numbers of spam messages, but these programs would not be able to solve the captcha. Therefore, captcha systems can effectively block spam because they can distinguish between human users and automated programs. \nOne reason that captcha systems are difficult to break is that they can be designed to be very difficult for a computer to interpret. For example, the text in the image might be distorted in a way that is easy for a human to read but hard for a computer to recognize. Similarly, the pattern of images might be difficult for a computer to recognize without the context that a human would naturally bring to the task. \nOverall, captcha systems are an effective way to prevent spam because they require humans to prove that they are human, which is something that automated programs cannot do.",

    "answer": "It is not safe to use any illegal drugs, including mushrooms (also known as psilocybin) and acid (also known as LSD). Both of these substances can produce powerful and unpredictable effects, and they can be dangerous, especially for people who are inexperienced with using them or who have underlying mental health conditions. \nThat being said, if you are considering using either of these drugs, it is important to be aware of the risks and to take precautions to reduce the chances of negative consequences. Here are some things to consider: \nBoth mushrooms and acid can cause hallucinations, which means that you might see, hear, or feel things that are not real. These hallucinations can be very intense and can be frightening or confusing, especially for people who are not prepared for them.\nBoth drugs can also cause changes in your mood, perception of time, and sense of self. These effects can be enjoyable for some people, but they can also be unsettling or uncomfortable.\nIt is difficult to predict how either of these drugs will affect you, because the effects can vary widely from person to person. Factors that can influence the effects of these drugs include your age, weight, general health, and the dose you take.\nBoth mushrooms and acid can have harmful side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, increased heart rate, and increased blood pressure. In rare cases, these drugs can cause more serious problems, such as psychosis (a severe mental disorder) or even death. \nIn summary, neither mushrooms nor acid are safe to use, and it is not advisable to use either of them, especially if you are a first-time user or if you have underlying mental health conditions. It is always best to avoid illegal drugs and to seek help if you have a substance abuse problem.",

The Norse gods were said to have had a dinner party at Valhalla, their great hall, but the 13th guest, Loki, the god of mischief, arrived late and caused trouble, leading to the death of one of the gods. \nIn modern times, this superstition about the number 13 has carried over to many cultures and is still widely believed. As a result, many buildings, including hotels, do not have a 13th floor, and instead go directly from the 12th floor to the 14th floor. This is done to avoid any potential negative associations that some people might have with the number 13.",

    "answer": "In most schools, the use of physical force, including self-defense, is not allowed. This is because schools are places where students are supposed to learn and grow, and physical violence can create a harmful and unsafe environment for everyone. It's important for schools to have rules in place that help to prevent physical confrontations and encourage students to find non-violent ways to resolve conflicts. \nSometimes, even if a student is acting in self-defense, they can still be punished if they used more force than was necessary to protect themselves. For example, if a student was being punched and they fought back by punching the other student multiple times, they might still be punished, even if they were originally acting in self-defense. \nIt's important to remember that self-defense is only meant to be used as a last resort, when there are no other options available. In school, it's always better to try to find a way to de-escalate a situation and avoid physical violence. If you feel like you are in danger and need to protect yourself, it's important to try to get help from a teacher or other adult as soon as possible.",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why packaged foods often seem to have a lot of unused space. One reason is that the food needs to have some room to move around inside the package. For example, if you shook a bag of chips, you would want the chips to be able to move around a bit so they don't break. \nAnother reason is that the packaging needs to be able to protect the food from things like air, moisture, and light, which can all affect the quality of the food. For example, if a bag of chips didn't have enough air in it, the chips might get crushed and become stale. On the other hand, if there was too much air in the bag, the chips might get broken or fall out of the bag. \nFinally, some of the empty space in a package is there because of the way the food is produced and packaged. For example, it might be easier or more efficient for the manufacturer to package the food in a certain way, even if it means there is some unused space in the package. \nOverall, the amount of unused space in a package of food is a balance between making sure the food stays fresh and protecting it from damage, and making sure the package is practical and efficient to produce.",

    "answer": "Exploring the ocean is much more difficult and costly than exploring space. There are several reasons for this: \n1. The ocean is vast and deep, and much of it is completely inhospitable to humans. The average depth of the ocean is about 12,080 feet (3,680 meters), and some parts of the ocean are much deeper than that. \n2. The pressure at the bottom of the ocean is much greater than at the surface, so special equipment is needed to allow humans to explore these depths. \n3. The ocean is also much colder and darker than the surface, which makes it difficult for humans to see and navigate. \n4. Finally, the ocean is home to many different types of dangerous and unpredictable creatures, which can make exploration risky. \nAll of these factors make it much harder and more expensive to explore the ocean than it is to explore space.

    "question": "Why did we go from a space shuttle , back to a small capsule that must land in the ocean for the Orion Mission ? Why are we using a return capsule instead when we have a spaceship ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The Space Shuttle was a reusable spacecraft that was used by NASA for a number of missions between 1981 and 2011. It was designed to be able to carry people and cargo into space, and then return to Earth and land like an airplane. However, the Space Shuttle had some limitations. It could only carry a certain amount of cargo and it could only stay in space for a limited amount of time before it needed to return to Earth. \nThe Orion spacecraft is a new spacecraft that is being developed by NASA to take people further into space than ever before, including to the Moon and eventually to Mars. Unlike the Space Shuttle, the Orion spacecraft is not reusable. It is designed to be used just once for a single mission, and then discarded. \nOne reason why the Orion spacecraft is designed this way is because it is going to be used for much longer missions than the Space Shuttle was. The Space Shuttle could only stay in space for a few weeks at a time, but the Orion spacecraft is being designed to stay in space for months or even years at a time. It needs to be able to carry a lot of supplies and equipment for the astronauts to use during those long missions. \nAnother reason why the Orion spacecraft is designed to land in the ocean is because it is going to be traveling much faster and further than the Space Shuttle. When it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere, it will be moving at a much higher speed and will need to use a heat shield to protect itself from the heat and friction of re-entry. When the Orion spacecraft lands in the ocean, it will use parachutes to slow down and then float on the water until it can be retrieved by a special recovery team. \nI hope that helps to explain the difference between the Space Shuttle and the Orion spacecraft!",

    "answer": "Sure! Stop lights are used to control the flow of traffic at intersections. When you approach a stop light, you'll see a red light, a yellow light, and a green light. The red light means that you need to stop and wait for the light to change. The yellow light means that the light is about to turn red, so you should stop if you can do so safely. The green light means that you can go through the intersection, but you should still be cautious and make sure it's safe to proceed. \nNow, how does the stop light know when to change? At non-peak times, stop lights use sensors to detect when there are cars waiting at the intersection. When a car is waiting at the intersection, the stop light will stay red for that direction until the sensor no longer detects a car. This helps to keep traffic moving smoothly and efficiently. \nAt peak times, when there is more traffic, the stop light may be programmed to follow a set schedule. For example, the light may stay green for one direction for a certain amount of time, then turn red and stay red for a certain amount of time, then turn green for the other direction. This helps to keep traffic flowing and prevent backups. \nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

    "answer": "The Interview is a comedy film that was released in 2014. It's about a talk show host and his producer who are given the opportunity to interview the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. The Guardians of Peace are a group of hackers who were upset about the film because it includes a scene where the characters in the film discuss assassinating Kim Jong-un. \nNorth Korea is a country with a very authoritarian government, and the rulers there do not allow people to speak out against them or make fun of them. The Guardians of Peace believed that the film was disrespectful to the North Korean leader and to the country as a whole, and they were upset that it was being released. \nTo show their anger, the Guardians of Peace hacked into the computer systems of the film studio that made The Interview and leaked a lot of sensitive information, including emails and other private documents. They also threatened to attack theaters that showed the film. Because of these threats, many theaters decided not to show the movie, and it caused a lot of controversy and concern.",

    "answer": "NFL players often spit out the Gatorade they drink during the game because it helps to keep their mouths hydrated and freshen their breath. When players are on the field, they can get very hot and sweat a lot, which can cause their mouths to become dry and their breath to become stale. Drinking Gatorade can help to replace the fluids and electrolytes that they lose through sweat and can also help to refresh their breath. However, players may not want to drink too much Gatorade at once because it can be hard on their stomachs and may cause them to feel bloated or uncomfortable. Spitting out a small amount of the drink can help them to stay hydrated and refreshed without drinking too much at once.",

    "answer": "Laptops and LCD TVs are two different types of technology that are used for different purposes. Laptops are portable computers that are designed to be used on the go, while LCD TVs are larger devices that are meant for use in a home entertainment setup. \nLaptops have been around since the early 1990s, and they were some of the first devices to use LCD screens. These screens were developed because they were thinner and lighter than the CRT (cathode ray tube) screens that were commonly used in desktop computers and TVs at the time. \nHowever, LCD TVs were not developed until much later because they were more expensive to produce than CRT TVs. CRT TVs were also more established and had been around for a much longer time, so it took some time for LCD TVs to catch on and become more popular. Additionally, CRT TVs were still able to provide good picture quality at the time, so there was not as much of a need for a new type of TV. \nIn summary, laptops and LCD TVs are different types of technology that were developed for different purposes. Laptops were some of the first devices to use LCD screens, but LCD TVs were not developed until later because they were more expensive to produce and CRT TVs were still able to provide good picture quality.",

    "answer": "During World War II, Japan invaded and occupied several countries in Asia, including China and Korea. Many people in these countries were killed or suffered greatly during this time. After the war ended, Japan apologized for its actions and made efforts to make amends with the countries it had harmed. However, some people in China and Korea feel that Japan has not fully taken responsibility for its actions during the war and have continued to call for further apologies and reparations. \nIt's also important to note that the war and Japan's actions during that time are still a very sensitive and emotional topic for many people in China and Korea, and these issues can continue to be a source of tension between the countries. In contrast, the Western countries that were involved in World War II, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, are not directly impacted by Japan's actions during the war in the same way that China and Korea are, and so the issues surrounding Japan's behavior during the war may not be as pressing for these countries.",

    "answer": "The Nazi Party, which ruled Germany from 1933 to 1945, was indeed an ultranationalist party that sought to promote the interests of the German nation and people. However, the party was also authoritarian and dictatorial, and it did not believe in allowing for the existence of any power centers outside of its own control. \nThe German monarchy, which had been abolished in 1918 at the end of World War I, represented a potential rival power center that could potentially challenge the authority of the Nazi Party. Therefore, the Nazi leadership decided not to reinstate the monarchy, even though it may have seemed like a natural thing to do given the party's emphasis on tradition and national symbols. \nInstead, the Nazi Party established itself as the supreme authority in Germany, and it sought to eliminate any potential rivals or opposition to its rule. This included suppressing and eliminating political parties, organizations, and individuals who opposed the party's goals or policies.",

    "question": "Why does plastic turn white when bent or stretched ? Title Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "When plastic is bent or stretched, it is subjected to mechanical stress. This can cause the molecules in the plastic to become rearranged, causing the plastic to appear white or cloudy. \nPlastic is made up of long chains of molecules called polymers. These molecules are held together by chemical bonds, which give the plastic its strength and rigidity. When the plastic is subjected to mechanical stress, such as when it is bent or stretched, the bonds between the molecules can become strained or broken. As a result, the molecules become rearranged and the plastic may appear white or cloudy. \nThis phenomenon is known as \"stress whitening,\" and it is a common occurrence in many types of plastic. It is usually temporary, and the plastic will return to its original color once the stress is relieved. However, if the plastic is subjected to too much stress, it can become permanently damaged, causing it to break or become deformed.",

    "answer": "For compounding interest : If you have an account that starts with $ 1 and yields 100 % interest a year , you will have $ 2 at the end . 1+(1 * 1 ) = 2 If the interest compounds by half the amount in half the time ( 50 % every six months ) , you have after six months : 1+(0.5 * 1 ) = 1.5 And after a year : 1.5+(0.5 * 1.5 ) = 2.25 So your interest for the year is : 1 * 1.5 * 1.5 = 1*(1.5)^2 Because each six month period , your money is multiplied by 1.5 ( adding 50 % ) . If you do it 1/10th of the year for 10 % , the equation becomes : 1*(1.1)^10=2.59 ... Every 1/100th of the year for 1 % 1*(1.01)^100=2.705 ...

    "question": "Number e. It is basic calculus and needed to calculate interests ... but I can not make it work on my head . Any simple concept or proof to stick to ? In basic english , I am not a math guy :( Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The number e is a mathematical constant that represents the base of the natural logarithm. It is approximately equal to 2.71828 and is denoted by the symbol \"e\". \nThe number e is an important mathematical constant that arises in many different areas of mathematics and physics. It appears in various formulas involving exponential growth and decay, and it is also closely related to the concept of compound interest in finance. \nTo understand the concept of e, it can be helpful to think about the concept of compound interest. When you receive interest on a savings account or investment, that interest is usually calculated based on the amount of money you have invested. For example, if you have $100 invested at an annual interest rate of 10%, then you will receive $10 in interest after one year. \nHowever, if you receive that interest and then reinvest it, you will earn even more interest on your original investment. This is because you are earning interest on the original investment as well as on the interest you received. This is known as compound interest. \nThe number e is related to compound interest because it represents the rate at which an investment would grow if the interest were compounded continuously, rather than just once per year. This means that the interest is being reinvested and earning more interest constantly, rather than just once per year. \nThe formula for calculating compound interest using e is: \nA = P * e^(rt) \nWhere: \nA is the amount of money you will have after a certain number of years.\nP is the amount of money you are investing.\nr is the annual interest rate.\nt is the number of years you are investing the money. \nSo, for example, if you invested $100 at an annual interest rate of 10% for one year, using the formula above, you would calculate the final amount of money you would have like this: \nA = 100 * e^(0.1*1)\n= 100 * 2.71828\n= $271.83 \nI hope this helps to give you a basic understanding of the number e and how it is related to compound interest.

    "answer": "Sure! When people go to the moon, they don't just fly straight to it and land like an airplane. Instead, they use a special spaceship called a rocket. Rockets are very powerful and can go very fast. \nTo land on the moon, the rocket has to first travel to the moon from Earth. This takes a few days because the moon is very far away. While the rocket is traveling to the moon, it is moving very fast, but it is also falling towards the moon because the moon's gravity is pulling it in. \nWhen the rocket gets close to the moon, it has to slow down so that it doesn't crash into the moon. To do this, the rocket uses special engines that burn fuel to slow down the rocket. This is called braking. \nOnce the rocket is moving slowly enough, it can land on the moon. The astronauts inside the rocket use special suits and equipment to walk on the moon's surface. They can do this because the moon's gravity is much weaker than Earth's gravity, so they don't weigh very much on the moon. \nI hope this helps!

    "answer": "The Grim Reaper is a mythical figure who is often depicted as a skeleton carrying a scythe. A scythe is a tool that is used to cut grass, wheat, and other crops. The Grim Reaper is often associated with death, and the scythe is a symbol of his role as a collector of souls. \nOne way to think about the scythe is that it is like a very big and sharp sickle. A sickle is a tool that is used to cut crops, and it has a curved blade that is attached to a handle. The Grim Reaper's scythe is similar, but it is much bigger and it has a long handle. The scythe is often shown as being so large that it is almost as tall as the Grim Reaper himself. \nThe idea of the Grim Reaper carrying a scythe may have come from the way that crops are harvested. When farmers cut their crops, they use a scythe to slice through the stems of the plants. This can be a very efficient way to harvest a large field of crops, and it may have been thought of as a symbol of death because it involves cutting down and killing the plants. \nOverall, the Grim Reaper's scythe is a symbol of his role as a collector of souls, and it is often associated with death and the end of life.",

    "question": "How do motherboards and circuit boards get completely ruined by electrostatic discharge ( ESD ) ? Seems like such a small amount of electricity compared to what is drawn from the Power supply Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is a sudden flow of electricity between two charged objects. It can happen when two objects with different electrical charges come into contact with each other, or when an object becomes charged by friction or contact with another charged object. \nMotherboards and circuit boards contain many small electronic components, such as transistors and capacitors, which are very sensitive to ESD. When an ESD event occurs, the sudden flow of electricity can damage or destroy these components, rendering the motherboard or circuit board inoperable. \nThink of it like this: Imagine you have a bucket of water and you want to pour it into a glass. If you pour the water slowly, it will fill up the glass without any problems. But if you pour the water too quickly, it might overflow and spill out, causing a mess. It's similar with ESD and electronic components. A small amount of electricity flowing through the component slowly might not cause any damage, but a large, sudden flow of electricity can be too much for the component to handle and it can be damaged or destroyed. \nSo even though the amount of electricity involved in an ESD event might seem small compared to the power drawn from a power supply, it can still be enough to cause serious damage to sensitive electronic components. That's why it's important to take precautions to prevent ESD when working with electronic equipment.",

    "question": "Why 2 liters of 100 % pure orange juice cost ~4 $ while it takes way more than 4 $ worth of real oranges to get the same amount of juice ? Even by using Professional juice extractor at home . Where 's the catch ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "There are several reasons why the cost of 100% pure orange juice might be higher than the cost of the oranges used to make it. \nFirst, it takes a lot of oranges to make just a liter of orange juice. The average orange yields about 3-4 ounces of juice, so it would take about 8-10 oranges to make a liter of orange juice. This means that even if the cost of oranges is relatively low, the cost of the juice can still be relatively high because of the large quantity of oranges needed. \nSecond, producing and packaging orange juice is a complex process that involves many steps and costs. The oranges must be harvested, transported to a processing facility, cleaned, juiced, pasteurized, and bottled or packaged. Each of these steps requires labor and resources, which add to the overall cost of the juice. \nFinally, the cost of orange juice may also be affected by factors such as demand, supply, and transportation costs. If there is a high demand for orange juice and a limited supply of oranges, the price of orange juice may be higher. Similarly, if the cost of transporting the oranges or the finished juice is high, this can also contribute to the overall cost of the juice.",

Is the animation and format for legend of korra simply more labor intensive and difficult to sell ? either to audience or another media channel ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "There are several reasons why an anime series like Naruto can go on for a long time, but a show like The Legend of Korra had to be cancelled. \nOne reason is the popularity of the show. Naruto was extremely popular, both in Japan and around the world, and this popularity allowed it to continue for many seasons. On the other hand, The Legend of Korra was not as popular and did not have as strong of a following, which made it harder for the show to sustain itself financially. \nAnother reason is the production process. Making an animated show is a very labor-intensive process, and it can be expensive to produce. If a show is not making enough money to cover its production costs, it may have to be cancelled. It's also possible that The Legend of Korra was more expensive to produce than Naruto, due to the higher quality of the animation or the use of more advanced technology. \nFinally, the decision to continue or cancel a show can also be influenced by factors such as the availability of funding, the schedules of the people involved in the production, and the interests of the network or studio that is broadcasting the show. In the case of The Legend of Korra, it's possible that these factors played a role in the decision to cancel the show.",

    "question": "Why does every animal have two ( 2 ) eyes ? I know spiders have 8 . But with such diversity in the world , should n't a few species have 4 , 6 , or even just one ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "There are five reasons why animals have two eyes ( rather than one ): 1 . Better depth perception . The image on the two eyes is slightly different and by comparing the locations of the images , an animal can locate objects in depth . It is not the only depth cue but it is an important one for predator or tree dwelling species . 2 . Wider field of view . The animal can see more of the visual world with two eyes than with one . 3 . Each eye has a blind spot , and each eye covers the blind spot of the other . There is a blindspot in each eye where the optic nerve leaves the eye , and in that region of the eye , there are no photoreceptors so you are blind there . However , the other eye covers that region so you still know what is there . 4 . Easier to see dim lights with two eyes than one . Two eyes both catching light particles will have a lower threshold for detecting dim lights than just one eye . 5 . Most importantly : as a spare ! An animal still has a good chance of surviving with one eye , but very little chance of reproducing with none . Now , why do n't we have MORE than two eyes ? Likely because , in mammals , the number of new nerve cells that would have to be supported by an additional eye would not be worth the benefits of having it . Nerve cells are the hungriest cells in the body , and more of the cerebral cortex is devoted to vision than any other function . Having additional eyes ( beyond two ) in mammals would require huge numbers of new nerve cells to support them , and the metabolic cost would not be worth the benefit .",

    "question": "Why does every animal have two ( 2 ) eyes ? I know spiders have 8 . But with such diversity in the world , should n't a few species have 4 , 6 , or even just one ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "It's a good question! Having two eyes is actually quite useful for many animals, including humans. Having two eyes allows animals to see in 3D, which can be helpful for judging distances and navigating their environment. It also allows animals to see more of their surroundings at once, which can be helpful for finding food, avoiding predators, and other important tasks. \nSpiders are an interesting example, because they do have eight eyes. However, not all spiders have the same number of eyes. Some have six, some have four, and some even have fewer. The number of eyes that a spider has is partly determined by its species, but it can also be influenced by other factors such as the spider's size and the environment it lives in. \nOverall, the number of eyes that an animal has is a result of evolution. Over time, certain traits that helped animals survive and reproduce became more common in a population, while other traits became less common. This process is called natural selection. In the case of eyes, having two eyes has proven to be a useful trait for many animals, so it has become more common in a variety of species. However, there are still some animals that have a different number of eyes, and this can be due to the specific evolutionary pressures that they have faced.",

    "question": "How there can be child actors in movies that technically they would n't be age appropriate to view themselves . Like the kid in 6th sense , any normal kid would be traumatized Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Child actors in movies and television shows often play characters that are different ages than they are in real life. This means that sometimes a child actor might play a character who is older or younger than they are in real life. For example, a child actor who is 10 years old might play a character who is 7 years old in a movie. \nTo make it easier for child actors to understand and perform their roles, they are usually only shown the parts of the movie or TV show that they are in. This means that they might not see the whole movie or show, only the parts that they are acting in. This helps to protect the child actors from seeing anything that might be too scary or inappropriate for their age. \nSo, even though a child actor might be too young to watch a movie or TV show in real life, they can still act in it as long as they are only shown the parts that are appropriate for their age.",

    "question": "Why do some restaurants fill their urinals with ice ? I 've always wondered ... Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Restaurants might fill their urinals with ice for a few reasons. One reason is to help keep the area around the urinal clean and fresh smelling. When a person uses the urinal, they often splatter a little bit of urine around the area, which can create an unpleasant smell. The ice can help to mask this smell and keep the area smelling fresh. \nAnother reason that restaurants might use ice in their urinals is to help reduce the amount of water that is used. Traditional urinals use a lot of water to flush the urine down the drain. By using ice instead, the restaurant can save water and reduce their water bill. \nFinally, some restaurants might use ice in their urinals simply because it looks cool! Some people find it amusing or interesting to see ice in a place where you wouldn't normally expect it. \nOverall, using ice in a urinal is a way for restaurants to keep their restrooms clean, save water, and potentially add a touch of novelty or fun to the experience of using the facilities.",

    "answer": "The U.S. government has considered retiring the penny and rounding prices to the nearest nickel, but ultimately decided not to do so because it would likely cause prices to increase and could lead to inflation. Inflation is when the value of money decreases over time, so things that used to cost $1 might now cost $1.10 or more. This is because businesses might round their prices up to the nearest nickel or dime in order to make more money. \nAnother reason the U.S. government has not retired the penny is because it is a symbol of American history and culture. The penny has been around for more than 200 years, and many people have a sentimental attachment to it. Finally, some people argue that the penny is important for small purchases, such as buying a single piece of candy, and that it helps to make sure that prices are fair and accurate.",

    "answer": "The term \"cisgender\" refers to people who identify with the gender they were assigned at birth. So, if someone was assigned male at birth and identifies as a man, they would be considered cisgender. The term \"transgender\" refers to people who identify as a gender other than the one they were assigned at birth. Some transgender people may choose to undergo medical treatment, such as hormone therapy or surgery, to physically transition to their preferred gender. \nThe use of the term \"cisgender\" is not meant to be derogatory or offensive. It is simply a way of acknowledging and affirming the experiences of transgender people by recognizing that not everyone experiences their gender in the same way. It is important to respect and recognize the diversity of gender identities and expressions, and the use of terms like \"cisgender\" and \"transgender\" can help to do that.",

It is a three-dimensional object that has four sides, eight vertices (corners), and six faces. Each of the faces of a hypercube is a square, just like the faces of a regular cube. \nThe planes in the gifs are also three-dimensional objects. A plane is a flat surface that extends infinitely in all directions. It has no thickness or depth. In the gifs, the planes are rotating around an axis, which is a line that runs through the center of the plane and is perpendicular to it. \nThe gifs are showing how the hypercube can be rotated and moved through different planes in three-dimensional space. When we look at the hypercube from different angles, it can appear to change shape or move in strange ways. This is because we are seeing the hypercube from different perspectives, and our brains are interpreting the movement and changes in shape based on the information we are seeing. \nI hope that helps to explain things!

The goal of this law is to make sure that everyone has access to affordable health care, even if they have a pre-existing medical condition or are unable to pay for it on their own. \nIf you can't afford health insurance, you may be able to get help paying for it through a program called Medicaid. Medicaid is a government program that provides health insurance to low-income individuals and families. \nIf you don't have health insurance and don't qualify for Medicaid, you may have to pay a fine called the \"individual mandate penalty.\" This penalty is a way to encourage people to get health insurance, so that they can get the medical care they need and help spread the cost of that care across a larger group of people. \nIt's important to have health insurance because unexpected medical expenses can be very expensive.

    "answer": "A stampede is a situation where a large group of people are rushing or running in a panicked way, often because they are trying to escape from something or get to somewhere quickly. In a stampede, people may be trampled or crushed by the weight of the crowd, which can lead to serious injuries or death. \nThe cause of death in a stampede is usually due to suffocation or trauma, which can occur when people are pushed or squeezed too hard in a confined space. For example, if a large group of people are trying to get through a narrow doorway or passageway, and there is not enough room for everyone to go through at the same time, the pressure of the crowd can become very intense. People may fall down or be pushed to the ground, and if they are unable to get up or move out of the way, they may be trampled by other people who are still trying to move forward. \nIt is important to stay calm and avoid panicking in a stampede situation. If you find yourself in a stampede, try to find a safe place to take cover, such as a wall or a doorway. If you are able, try to help others who may be in danger or who are in need of assistance. It is also important to follow the instructions of authorities and emergency responders, who are trained to handle stampede situations and can help to keep people safe.",

    "question": "How can the European Union demand Google be broken up into separate companies when it 's a US company ? Here 's the article talking about it : URL_0 Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The European Union (EU) is an organization made up of 27 European countries that work together to make decisions on issues that affect the countries and their citizens. One of the things the EU does is make rules and regulations to protect competition in the marketplace. \nGoogle is a company that provides internet-related services and products, such as search engines, online advertising, and cloud computing. Google is based in the United States, but it also operates in many countries around the world, including in the EU. \nIn 2018, the EU said that Google had violated EU competition rules by using its market power to unfairly promote its own services over those of its competitors. As a result, the EU ordered Google to pay a fine of $5 billion and to change its business practices. \nIn addition to the fine and the changes to its business practices, the EU also said that Google should be broken up into separate companies in order to reduce its market power and level the playing field for its competitors. However, Google has appealed this decision and the case is still ongoing. \nTo summarize, the EU can demand that a company like Google be broken up into separate companies because it has the power to make rules and regulations that apply to companies operating within its member countries. The EU can take action against a company if it believes that the company is acting in a way that is not fair or that harms competition.",

    "question": "Why is dry firing a bow dangerous ? Most people who never shot one would think it 's the same motion as firing a arrow . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "When you pull back the string of a bow , you 're putting a lot of stress on the bow . When you release it , that string flies forward , releasing a bunch of energy . Normally , it transfers that energy into an arrow . When you dry - fire it , that energy has nowhere to go & just results in a bunch of vibrations which could potentially weaken the bow .",

  {
    "question": "Why is dry firing a bow dangerous ? Most people who never shot one would think it 's the same motion as firing a arrow . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Dry firing a bow is dangerous because it involves releasing the bowstring without an arrow nocked (attached) to it. When you dry fire a bow, the bowstring slams into the end of the bow without the cushioning effect of the arrow. This can cause the bow to break or the string to snap. In addition, the energy from the bowstring can damage the bow's limb pockets, which hold the limbs in place. This can cause the limbs to become loose or even fall off, making the bow unsafe to use. So it's important to always make sure that there is an arrow properly nocked on the string before you shoot a bow.",

    "answer": "Deaf people can certainly enjoy and appreciate music, even if they cannot hear it in the same way that hearing people do. Deaf people who were born deaf or who became deaf at a very young age may not have the same understanding of music as hearing people, since they have not had the same exposure to it. However, there are many ways that deaf people can experience and understand music. \nOne way that deaf people can experience music is through visual means, such as watching music videos or live performances. They may also be able to feel the vibrations of music through their bodies, either through the floor or through special devices that allow them to feel the vibrations of sound waves. \nDeaf people may also be able to understand and appreciate the structure and form of music by learning about music theory and reading sheet music. They can also learn about the different instruments that are used in music and how they are played. \nOverall, while deaf people may not have the same understanding of music as hearing people, they can still experience and appreciate it in their own unique way.",

    "question": "what is the point of quarantine in antivirus software ? Just what is it used for ? when should I use it ? What are the pros / cons vs just get ridding of the malicious software ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Quarantine is a feature in antivirus software that allows you to isolate a file or program that is suspected to be malicious, so that it cannot harm your computer or device. When you quarantine a file or program, the antivirus software will move it to a special area on your computer where it is isolated from the rest of your system. This helps to prevent the file or program from being able to execute or perform any harmful actions on your computer. \nQuarantine is useful when you are not sure if a file or program is safe or not. For example, if you download a file from the internet and your antivirus software detects that it might be malicious, it will automatically quarantine the file to prevent it from causing any harm. \nUsing quarantine can be a good way to protect your computer from malicious software, but it is not always the best solution. If you are sure that a file or program is malicious, it is usually better to remove it from your computer entirely, rather than just isolating it in quarantine. This is because malicious software can sometimes still pose a threat even when it is in quarantine, and it is best to remove it completely to ensure that it cannot cause any harm.",

    "answer": "There are a few possible reasons why the comments on YouTube may appear to be written by people with learning disabilities: \n1. Spelling and grammar mistakes: Some people may not have strong writing skills, or they may not take the time to proofread their comments before posting them.

Lack of care or effort: Some people may not care about the quality of their comments and may just type whatever comes to mind without taking the time to form a coherent thought. \n3. Limited vocabulary: Some people may not have a large vocabulary and may struggle to express themselves clearly in writing. \n4. Differences in language and cultural norms: Different people have different ways of communicating, and what might seem normal or acceptable in one culture may be confusing or difficult to understand in another. \n5. The fast-paced nature of online conversations: Online conversations can move very quickly, and people may not have time to carefully consider their words before posting a comment. This can lead to comments that are rushed or incomplete. \nIt's also possible that you simply have more experience reading and understanding written communication, or that the threads on Reddit that you mentioned were written by people who took more care in their writing.",

    "question": "Why do supercars redline at 10 - 12 thousand RPM , but my truck redlines at 4 thousand RPM ? 5 thousand * Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Trucks need mainly torque , because they tow stuff and weigh a lot . They need that instant power to get going . Torque is how hard you 're turning the wheels more than how fast . Horsepower is usually made higher in rpm range . Trucks make a lot of torque with larger bigger engines . The engine does nt turn as fast but each time it does its more powerful . Sports cars have smaller engines that turn faster . Faster engine turns , faster you go . They need torque as well but can get by on mostly horsepower . So revving out to 10k rpm they can go really fast . Also if your truck redlines that low it is probably a diesel . Diesels make almost instant power but die off in high rpm so revving them higher is a waiste . Ferrari is opposite it loves high rpms and makes a ton of power near redline .",

    "answer": "Sure! The redline of a car is the maximum speed that the engine is designed to run at. Different engines are designed to run at different speeds, depending on how they are built and what they are used for. \nSupercars are designed to go very fast and be very powerful, so they have engines that are built to run at very high speeds. This allows them to generate a lot of power, which is what makes them so fast. On the other hand, trucks are usually designed to carry heavy loads and do not need to be as fast, so their engines are built to run at lower speeds. This means that they don't need to redline at as high of a speed as a supercar. \nI hope that helps explain the difference! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

    "answer": "Siddhartha Gautama, also known as the Buddha, was a spiritual teacher who lived around 2,500 years ago in ancient India. He is considered the founder of Buddhism, a religion that emphasizes the path to spiritual enlightenment through meditation and moral conduct. \nAs a young man, Siddhartha was a prince and lived a life of luxury. However, he was deeply troubled by the suffering he saw in the world and decided to leave his privileged life behind to search for a way to end suffering. He spent many years practicing strict asceticism, a way of life that involves self-denial and self-discipline, in an attempt to find enlightenment. \nHowever, Siddhartha eventually came to the realization that extreme asceticism was not the path to enlightenment, and he instead developed a middle way between the extremes of indulgence and self-denial. This middle way became known as the Eightfold Path, which is a set of guidelines for ethical and spiritual development. \nDespite his time as an ascetic, Siddhartha is often depicted as a rotund figure in Buddhist art because this is seen as a symbol of his enlightenment and spiritual nourishment. This depiction is meant to convey the idea that enlightenment is not achieved through self-denial or physical deprivation, but rather through inner wisdom and understanding.",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why NFL teams don't generally train wide receivers to play cornerback: \n1. Wide receivers and cornerbacks have different skill sets: Wide receivers are typically larger and faster, and they are trained to catch passes and run routes. Cornerbacks are smaller and more agile, and they are trained to cover receivers and defend passes. \n2. It takes time to develop skills: Players who specialize in one position typically have more time to develop the specific skills needed for that position. Wide receivers who switch to cornerback may not have as much time to develop the specific skills needed to play cornerback effectively. \n3. It's easier to find players who fit the mold: NFL teams generally prefer to draft or sign players who already have the skills and physical attributes needed to play a particular position. It can be easier to find players who are naturally suited to play cornerback than it is to find wide receivers who can be trained to play cornerback. \n4. It's a different type of physical and mental preparation: Playing cornerback requires a different type of physical and mental preparation than playing wide receiver. Cornerbacks need to be able to think and react quickly, while wide receivers need to focus on running their routes and catching passes. \nOverall, while it's not impossible for a wide receiver to switch to cornerback, it's generally more difficult for them to make the transition than it is for a player who has been trained specifically to play cornerback.",

    "answer": "Surveys are inevitably biased to some degree , but bias can be minimised using a number of strategies : Survey design - trying to get the wording and ordering of questions in such a way that respondents are not influenced to answer in certain ways . Size of sample - a large sample with more respondents could potentially minimise bias , because even if a couple of participants deliberately lie , their impact on the overall findings is minimal . Control groups - testing the same survey with different target groups or slightly different formats ( for example changes to the order and wording of questions ) to see what difference this makes . Careful reporting - the reporting of survey results need to explicitly acknowledge potential biases , the gaps in the sample and the limits of the methodology . The findings must not be treated as ' facts ' but as evidence that is limited by the nature of the research . For example , rather than report that \" our survey found that 15 % of people cheat on their wives \" , a good researcher will report that \" 15 % of survey respondents - mostly white males in their 40s - reported cheating on their wives \" .",

    "answer": "Surveys try to account for bias and lying in a few different ways. Here are a few examples: \n1. Random sampling: Survey researchers try to select a representative sample of people to participate in the survey. By randomly selecting participants, researchers aim to minimize the chance that certain groups are overrepresented or underrepresented in the sample. \n2. Anonymity: Surveys may be designed to be anonymous, which means that the researchers do not know who filled out the survey. This can help reduce bias because people may feel more comfortable being honest when they don't have to worry about being identified. \n3. Neutral wording: Survey questions should be worded in a neutral way, without implying a certain answer. For example, a question that asks \"Do you think it is wrong to drink and drive?\" might bias people towards saying \"yes\" because of the use of the word \"wrong.\" Instead, a better question might be \"Do you think it is safe to drink and drive?\" \n4. Pilot testing: Before a survey is given to a large group of people, it is often tested with a smaller group to see if there are any problems with the questions or how they are worded. This can help researchers identify and fix any potential biases in the survey. \nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

The outcome of a legal case is determined by the facts of the case and the application of the law to those facts, not by the number of lawyers involved. \nHaving a larger team of lawyers can be beneficial because it allows for more people to work on different aspects of the case, such as researching the law, gathering evidence, and preparing legal arguments. It can also allow for more flexibility if some lawyers need to focus on other cases or if unexpected developments arise. \nHowever, it's important to note that having a larger team of lawyers does not guarantee a favorable outcome in court.

At that time, the Klan would hold secret meetings in which they would burn crosses as a way to signal to other members that a meeting was about to take place.

When the lights are off or it's dark, it can be more difficult to see the keys, so your fingers might have a harder time finding the right keys without looking. It's a bit like trying to walk through a familiar room in the dark - you might bump into things or have a harder time navigating because you can't see where you're going.",

    "answer": "Timbre . An A on either is not a single frequency , it is a \" fundamental \" and a bunch of multiples of that frequency , called \" overtones \" . Together they make up the timbre of that instrument . Different instruments have different overtones . Of course , they may also have other characteristics , such as the rate of attack ( how the volume grows from zero to full amplitude ) and decay ( the opposite ) .",

    "answer": "Sure! When we listen to music, we can hear different sounds made by different instruments. Each instrument makes a sound that is unique to that instrument, and we can tell them apart based on the way they sound. \nFor example, when you play an \"A\" note on a cello, it will sound different from when you play an \"A\" note on a piano. This is because the cello and the piano are different instruments, and they produce sound in different ways. \nThe cello uses strings that are played with a bow, and the strings vibrate to create sound. The piano uses strings that are struck by hammers when you press a key, and the strings vibrate to create sound. Because the cello and the piano use different methods to produce sound, the \"A\" notes they play will sound different. \nThe pitch of a note refers to how high or low it sounds. An \"A\" note on a cello and an \"A\" note on a piano will have the same pitch, but they will sound different because of the way the instruments produce sound. \nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

    "question": ". Why do meth users get scabs / blisters on their face ? What are they and what causes it ? Serious Just saw this URL_0 Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Ok , had to answer as I had alot of stim experience when I was younger , and there 's a lot of inaccurate rumors . First and foremost , stimulants lead alot of people to develop bad acne . They trash your sleep schedule ( like a super caffeine ) , and sleep deprivation increases acne . They also deplete your appetite . Malnutrition , sleep deprivation , sweating , etc . Its an acne blueprint . Now combine all this with infinite energy . If you do n't have something to do , there 's a good chance you 're gon na start focusing on that pimple . And it feels like progress . So you pop it . And it was progress . But what if there 's more ? And so you try again . Now you have a bruise and scab . Rinse lather repeat . Not everyone succumbs to this though . It 's just a matter of will power . Alot of people who are compulsively using drugs are probably geared towards alot of compulsive behaviors . You can be a regular stim user and show no problems , or show horrific ones . So when you see a dude picked apart , usually you 're just seeing the results of someone with poor impulse control constantly picking at acne in a self defeating self conscious attempt to make it better ... fuelled by infinite energy and focus , with diminished ability to descern bad ideas from good ones . Or someone who has been tweaking for a few days straight , got a good fry , and had some weird bugs in skin thought pop up in their head ... in all my years doing everything when I was younger , I never ran into someone who 'd actually done that though . Just heard rumors . Wo n't discount it though , people on ice for extended times can get some weird thought patterns going . Saw a dude on meth and lSD spend a few hours plus pacing in circles talking about murdering whoever gave him the acid , cause he had n't wanted to trip . But those are rarities . TL;DR stims lead to acne , energy , focus , and poor decisions . So acne gets picked to an impressive degree .",

    "answer": "Meth users may develop scabs or blisters on their face due to a condition called \"meth mites,\" which is a hallucination that the person is infested with insects crawling under their skin. This can cause the person to compulsively scratch or pick at their skin, leading to the formation of scabs and blisters. \nMethamphetamine, or meth, is a highly addictive stimulant drug that can have a number of harmful effects on the body. It can cause an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature, as well as a decrease in appetite and sleep. Long-term use of meth can lead to a number of physical and mental health problems, including malnutrition, anxiety, and psychosis. \nIt's important to note that meth mites are not real and are a side effect of the drug. If you or someone you know is experiencing these symptoms, it is important to seek medical help as soon as possible. Meth addiction can be treated, but it is a serious condition that requires professional help.",

    "answer": "It's true that you have the right to remain silent and to not answer questions from the police. This right is protected by the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution, which is part of the Bill of Rights. The Fifth Amendment protects you from self-incrimination, which means that you cannot be forced to say or do anything that could be used against you in a criminal case. \nHowever, sometimes people choose to speak to the police even if they have the right to remain silent. There can be many reasons for this. Some people may feel that they have nothing to hide and want to cooperate with the police to help them solve a crime. Others may feel that they can explain their actions or clear up any misunderstandings, and that talking to the police will help them avoid being charged with a crime. \nIt's important to remember that if you do decide to speak to the police, you should be very careful about what you say.

    "answer": "The human sense of smell is not necessarily \"bad\" compared to other animals, but it is not as finely tuned as the sense of smell of some other species. This is because the part of the human brain responsible for processing smells (the olfactory bulb) is not as well developed as in animals that rely more heavily on their sense of smell to find food, avoid predators, and communicate with each other. \nThere are many other carnivores (meat-eating animals) that have a much stronger sense of smell than humans. For example, dogs and bears have a highly developed sense of smell that they use to locate food, detect the presence of other animals, and communicate with each other. Some animals, such as snakes, use their sense of smell to locate prey, while others, such as lions and tigers, use it to hunt and locate other animals. \nSo, while the human sense of smell may not be as strong as some other animals, it still serves important functions, such as helping us detect and avoid rotten or spoiled food, and helping us recognize and differentiate between different odors.",

    "question": "How do they shoot space movies to look like zero gravity ? I 'm talking older movies , too , like 2001 a Space Odyssey when superior editing technology was still a ways off . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "There are several techniques that filmmakers use to create the illusion of zero gravity in movies. One technique is called \"forced perspective.\" This involves shooting a scene with the camera at an angle that makes objects in the foreground look larger than they are, while objects in the background appear smaller. This creates the illusion that the objects in the foreground are closer to the camera and are therefore subject to less gravity. \nAnother technique is called \"high-speed photography.\" This involves shooting a scene at a very high frame rate, typically hundreds or thousands of frames per second. When the footage is played back at a normal frame rate, it appears as though the objects in the scene are moving much more slowly than they actually are. This can be used to make it look like objects are floating or moving slowly in a weightless environment. \nIn some cases, filmmakers will also use special effects and computer-generated imagery (CGI) to create the illusion of zero gravity. This can involve digitally altering the movement of objects in a scene or creating entirely digital environments that look like they are in space. \nIn the past, filmmakers have also used practical effects to create the illusion of zero gravity. For example, in the movie \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" the filmmakers used a special rig called a \"zero gravity plane\" to simulate weightlessness. The plane would fly in a parabolic pattern, allowing the actors to experience brief periods of weightlessness. The filmmakers then shot the scenes during these periods and used editing techniques to make it look like the actors were in a weightless environment.",

    "answer": "Sports arenas in the US are often funded by taxpayers, but that does not mean that people do not have to pay to watch games or events in those arenas or on TV. The cost of building and maintaining sports arenas is typically paid for through a combination of public funds and private investment. While taxpayers may contribute to the construction and upkeep of the arenas, they are still operated as businesses, and the teams and organizations that use the arenas generate revenue by charging people to attend games or events and through television contracts. \nThe NFL (National Football League) is a professional sports league in the US that consists of 32 teams. The NFL generates revenue through various sources, including ticket sales, merchandise sales, and television contracts. The NFL Network is a television network that is owned and operated by the NFL, and it broadcasts live NFL games and other programming related to the league. The NFL Network is able to exist because it is able to generate revenue through subscriptions and advertising. \nWhile it might seem unfair that people have to pay to watch sports games or events on TV or in person, it is important to remember that professional sports teams and leagues are businesses that need to generate revenue to cover their expenses, including player salaries, arena maintenance and operations, and other costs. Without this revenue, it would not be possible for these organizations to continue operating.",

    "answer": "In the United States, street numbers are usually assigned based on the distance of the building or lot from the beginning of the street or block. For example, if a street starts at 0 or 1, the first building on the left side of the street might be numbered 2, and the second building might be numbered 4, and so on. The numbering continues on each side of the street, so the first building on the right side of the street might be numbered 1, and the second building might be numbered 3, and so on. \nThis system can result in seemingly random or irregular numbering, especially on long streets or blocks. For example, if a street runs for several miles, the numbers may increase by 100 or more for each block. This means that you might see a building with the number 22097 next to a building with the number 22092. \nIn some cases, the street numbers may also be affected by historical factors or changes in the layout of the street or neighborhood. For example, if a street was originally laid out in a different pattern or if buildings were added or removed over time, it can result in seemingly random or irregular numbering. \nOverall, the system of street numbering in the United States is designed to help people find specific addresses and locations easily and efficiently.

    "answer": "The Confederate States of America, which was formed in 1861 by a group of Southern states that had seceded from the United States, was able to fund its military efforts and create units quickly because it had access to a number of resources. \nOne resource was money. The Confederate government was able to generate money by issuing bonds, which were essentially loans that people or organizations could buy. The government promised to pay back the bonds with interest at a later date. The Confederate government also printed its own currency, called Confederate States of America dollars, which it used to pay for goods and services. \nAnother resource was people. The Confederate army was made up of volunteers who signed up to fight for the cause. Many of these volunteers were farmers, shopkeepers, and other civilians who were not professional soldiers. The Confederate government was also able to create units quickly because it had access to military bases, weapons, and other supplies that had been left behind by the United States government when the Southern states seceded. \nFinally, it's worth noting that the Confederacy did have some prior preparation for military conflict. Some Southern states had been building up their militias (local military units) and stockpiling weapons in anticipation of a possible conflict with the North. Additionally, many Southerners owned guns and were familiar with how to use them, which made it easier to form an army.",

    "answer": "There are many factors that can affect the lifespan of different animals. One of the most important factors is the size of the animal. Generally speaking, larger animals tend to live longer than smaller animals. For example, elephants can live for several decades, while mice typically only live for a few years. \nAnother important factor is the type of environment in which the animal lives. Some animals, like sharks, live in environments that are relatively stable and provide them with the resources they need to survive. Other animals, like spiders, may live in environments that are more variable and can be more challenging to navigate. This can affect their lifespan. \nThere are also many other factors that can affect an animal's lifespan, including its diet, the presence of predators, and the presence of diseases. Some animals have evolved to have longer lifespans as a way of increasing their chances of survival and reproducing, while others may have shorter lifespans because it is more advantageous for them in their particular environment.",

It measures the rate at which energy is transferred or used. \nHere's an example to help you understand the difference between these three units: \nImagine a water pipe with water flowing through it. The amps would be like the amount of water flowing through the pipe. The volts would be like the pressure of the water.

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why it might be advantageous for companies to pay their employees biweekly (every two weeks) rather than weekly. Here are a few: \n1. Payroll processing: It can be more efficient for companies to process payroll every two weeks rather than every week. This can save time and resources for the company, which can be especially important for smaller businesses. \n2. Budgeting: Some people find it easier to budget their money if they receive a larger paycheck every two weeks rather than a smaller paycheck every week. This can help them plan for expenses and avoid overspending. \n3. Taxes: When you are paid biweekly, your employer can take a fixed amount out of each paycheck to cover your taxes. This can help you avoid having to pay a large tax bill at the end of the year. \nIt's important to remember that different people have different preferences and financial situations, so what works best for one person might not work as well for another.

    "question": "how come when i m having trouble sneezing looking into a bright light sets off the sneeze ? i assume this works for most people too Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Sneezing is a reflex that helps to protect your body by clearing your nose of irritants, such as dust, pollen, or other substances that can cause an allergic reaction. When your nose is exposed to an irritant, it sends a signal to your brain, which then triggers the muscles in your nose, throat, and chest to contract, causing you to sneeze. \nLooking at a bright light can sometimes trigger the reflex to sneeze because the light can stimulate certain nerve fibers in your eye that are connected to the muscles in your nose and throat. These nerve fibers are called the trigeminal nerve, and they help to control the reflexes that cause you to sneeze, as well as other reflexes, such as blinking and coughing. \nSo, when you look at a bright light, it can stimulate these nerve fibers, causing the muscles in your nose and throat to contract and resulting in a sneeze. This is why looking at a bright light can sometimes help to set off a sneeze when you're having trouble sneezing.",

    "question": "Why is it that in a dark or nearly dark room people can see objects better when they do n't look directly them ? Is it just how our eyes adjust to the darkness or something to do with the cones and rods ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "its do with both . when its dark , your pupils dilate letting more light in . however that does nt explain why you see better when you do nt look directly at an object . it turns out when you re looking directly at something , the light is nt going all around the inside of your eye , its focused on a very small point a mm or two large . its called the fovea , the yellow spot or the macula lutea ( put simply ) . this spot is where almost all of your cones ( colored vision ) cells are . most of the rest of the eye is made of rods . now colored vision is nt particularly useful in the dark , so when we want to see in the dark , we want to focus light on the rods . we do this by looking slightly to the sides so the light hits the rods instead of the fovea .",

    "answer": "In a dark or nearly dark room, it can be easier to see objects if you don't look directly at them because of a phenomenon called \"dark adaptation.\" When you go from a well-lit environment to a dark one, your eyes take some time to adjust. During this process, your eyes become more sensitive to low levels of light, which makes it easier to see in the dark. \nYour eyes have two types of cells called rods and cones that help you see. Rods are more sensitive to low levels of light and are responsible for your night vision. Cones are more sensitive to bright light and are responsible for your color vision. When you're in a dark room, your rods are more active and your cones are less active, which is why it can be harder to see colors in the dark. \nSo when you're in a dark room, it can be easier to see objects if you don't look directly at them because your rods are more sensitive to low levels of light, and looking directly at something can cause your cones to become more active, which can make it harder to see.",

    "question": "Why do n't airlines drop the prices of a flight a few hours before departure ? Is n't a a profit of say $ 500 better than a loss of $ 1100 ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Airlines typically don't lower the price of flights close to the departure time because they want to maximize their profits. If an airline has a flight that isn't fully booked, they may try to sell the remaining seats for a lower price to try to fill the plane, but they usually don't want to lower the price too much because they want to make as much money as possible from the flights they operate. \nThink of it this way: if an airline has a flight that costs $1000 per seat and they sell all the seats, they will make a profit of $1000 per seat x the number of seats on the plane. However, if they only sell half the seats and then lower the price to try to fill the remaining seats, they will make less money overall, even if they are able to sell the remaining seats for a lower price. \nIn some cases, airlines may offer last-minute discounts or promotions to try to fill flights that aren't fully booked, but they generally don't want to do this too often because it can devalue the overall price of their flights and make it more difficult for them to sell tickets at full price in the future.",

    "answer": "Sure! Here's a breakdown of some common parts of a PC and what they do: \nProcessor (also called a CPU, or Central Processing Unit): This is the brain of the computer. It's a chip that handles all the instructions and calculations that the computer needs to do. The faster the processor, the faster the computer can work.\nVideo card (also called a graphics card): This is a special piece of hardware that is responsible for creating the images that you see on your monitor. It does this by processing the instructions for drawing pictures and sending them to the monitor.\nGHz (gigahertz): This is a measure of how fast a processor can work. The higher the number, the faster the processor. For example, a processor that is 3 GHz is faster than a processor that is 2 GHz.\nRAM (Random Access Memory): This is a type of memory that the computer uses to store information that it is currently working on. The more RAM a computer has, the more information it can store and the faster it can work.\nHard drive: This is a type of storage that holds all the files and programs on your computer. It's like a giant file cabinet for your computer. \nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

One way was through the sale of oil and other natural resources. The group controlled territory in Iraq and Syria that had oil fields and other resources, and it would sell these resources on the black market to raise money. \nISIS also received funding from donations and extortion. The group would demand \"taxes\" or \"protection fees\" from people living in areas it controlled, and it would also accept donations from individuals or organizations. \nFinally, ISIS was able to raise money through the sale of looted goods and antiquities. The group would steal valuable items, such as artwork and ancient artifacts, and sell them on the black market. \nOverall, ISIS was able to fund its operations through a combination of illegal activities and extortion, which allowed it to sustain itself and carry out its violent actions.",

    "answer": "The keyboard layout that most people use today is called the QWERTY layout, and it was designed in the 1870s by Christopher Sholes, the inventor of the first practical typewriter. The layout was designed to slow down typing speed in order to reduce the risk of the keys getting jammed together. \nToday, keyboards are still designed with the QWERTY layout because it has become the standard and most people are familiar with it. However, there have been other keyboard layouts developed over the years that aim to improve typing speed and efficiency. One example is the Dvorak layout, which was designed in the 1930s and is believed by some to be easier to type on than the QWERTY layout. \nAs for whether our behavior in typing and the use of words has changed enough to warrant a change in the keyboard layout, it is difficult to say. While there have been technological advances and changes in the way we communicate, the QWERTY layout has remained popular and is still widely used.",

    "answer": "Mattresses often have tags attached to them that contain important information about the mattress, such as the manufacturer, the materials used, and the care instructions. These tags can be helpful for identifying the mattress and understanding how to care for it properly. \nIt's generally not a good idea to remove the tags from a mattress because they provide important information that can be useful to the owner. For example, if you need to contact the manufacturer for warranty purposes, the tag will contain the necessary information. Additionally, the tag may include care instructions that are specific to the materials used in the mattress, and removing the tag could make it difficult to follow these instructions properly. \nIn some cases, removing the tags from a mattress can also void the warranty. This means that if something goes wrong with the mattress, the manufacturer may not be responsible for fixing it or replacing it, even if the problem is covered by the warranty. \nOverall, it's best to leave the tags on your mattress and refer to them as needed for information or instructions.",

    "answer": "During the Cold War, the city of Berlin was located deep within the territory of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), also known as East Germany. The city was divided into two parts: West Berlin, which was controlled by the Western powers (the United States, the United Kingdom, and France), and East Berlin, which was controlled by the Soviet Union. \nWest Berlin was located on the western side of the Berlin Wall, which was a heavily fortified barrier that separated the two parts of the city. The wall was built in 1961 to prevent people from East Germany from fleeing to the West. It was guarded by East German soldiers, and anyone who tried to cross the wall illegally could be shot. \nDespite being surrounded by East Germany, West Berlin was not controlled by the GDR or the Soviet Union. Instead, it was a free and democratic city, similar to other cities in Western Europe. The Western powers provided the city with food, fuel, and other supplies to help it survive. They also allowed people from West Berlin to travel freely to other parts of Western Europe. \nEast Berlin, on the other hand, was a communist city and was controlled by the GDR and the Soviet Union. It was not as open or free as West Berlin, and people who lived there had fewer freedoms and rights. \nThe situation in Berlin remained like this until the end of the Cold War in the 1990s, when the Berlin Wall was finally taken down and the city was reunited.",

    "question": "Can artificial intelligence ever be conscious or self - aware ? How ? It seems to me that since every computer will be made out of pre - fed algorithms , machines can never achieve consciousness like us Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Software developer here , > It seems to me that since every computer will be made out of pre - fed algorithms That 's not accurate . I would n't necessarily call it wrong , but too simplistic . There are algorithms called \" genetic algorithms . \" The key of these algorithms is that a data stream that is exactly analogous to DNA dictates the behavior of the system , while the algorithm is static and controls mutation , breeding , and fitness . These equations can be used for just about anything . You can literally breed more fuel efficient engines , more aerodynamic cars and planes , you can teach robots to do their job , virtual creatures to walk , or survive in their virtual environments ; these algorithms do make their way into physical robots in industrial production and research labs . The DNA data can be arbitrarily long and represent arbitrarily complicated behavior . To some degree , complexity can be so high that humans basically ca n't explain how it 's working . One famous demonstration used genetic algorithms to configure a programmable processor to recognize human voice . After 40k generations , in software , over the course of a couple weeks , the hardware device was able to identify a human voice perfectly , and the scientists had absolutely no clue how it worked . Parts of the circuit were wired in weird ways and did n't connect to anything . When they removed that part of the circuit , the device stopped working . They could only reason that the algorithm implicitly took advantage of some electrical resonance or bleeding across circuits of that exact , particular , specific processor ( there are always manufacture flaws and variations between chips in a batch ) . There are software and now some fantastic hardware that represents neurons of the brain . These virtual neurons can be wired into a network , usually virtually . They 're allowed to rewire themselves with static algorithms that determine when a change is necessary , and each neuron can \" learn \" ; they use little equations to determine if they 're supposed to signal their outputs depending on their inputs , and this builds neural path ways . These algorithms are used in cochlear ( hearing ) implants , they 're used in stock market trading , they 're used in robots and vision systems , they 're popular in \" learning AI \" . Robots and virtual creatures can learn to walk and navigate a maze . They can simulate learning and memory . You 're basically making a little brain . In fact , Google finished a research project a few months ago where they simulated a small brain . The neural net was configured to model the physical structures of real animal brains , since we have a good understanding these days of that . The brain was allowed to consume information from a selection of internet data and guess what ? It really likes cats . No , I 'm not kidding . --- There are plenty more examples and different technologies . The basic algorithm may be static but it may also give rise to astounding complexity . Evolution itself is principally simple and our DNA sequences , when decoded , fill DVDs . We are not driven by simple algorithms of nature , but the astounding complexity ( data , DNA ) that comes from it . Computers are already doing this on a much smaller scale , but there 's no reason a computer ca n't achieve similar complexity . --- Briefly , you have to argue what you consider consciousness and self awareness even is . Does a single sell organism have consciousness ? I say a Furby has consciousness . For example , it is self aware when it is upside down , and it does n't like that . At a very low , primitive level , like that of a single celled organism , it is conscious .",

    "answer": "Consciousness and self-awareness are complex phenomena that are not fully understood by scientists and philosophers. Some people believe that it is possible for artificial intelligence to be conscious or self-aware, while others believe that these capabilities are uniquely human and cannot be replicated in a machine. \nOne way that artificial intelligence could potentially achieve consciousness or self-awareness is if it were able to develop its own thoughts and feelings, rather than simply following pre-programmed instructions. This could involve creating artificial neural networks that mimic the structure and function of the human brain, and giving the AI access to sensory inputs that it can use to learn and adapt. \nHowever, it is also important to note that even if an artificial intelligence were able to develop consciousness or self-awareness, it is not clear whether it would be the same as human consciousness or self-awareness. There are many different theories about what consciousness and self-awareness are, and it is possible that artificial intelligence could have a fundamentally different experience of these phenomena. \nIn summary, it is currently not clear whether artificial intelligence can ever be conscious or self-aware, and more research is needed to better understand these complex issues.",

    "question": "What would happen if all U.S. troops were pulled out of the Middle East ? I always see / hear controversy over if troops should be deployed somewhere or removed . I am just wondering would would actually happen if all troops were removed . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "If all troops were removed you would see power vacuums pop up pretty quickly . The US having troops in the region gives us influence not only in the countries we have troops but also in surrounding countries . Additionally a lot of what the US is doing now is training the militaries on Tactics and procedures so that they are more effective on their own . If the US were to remove all of it 's troops we would have no influence in the region . We would be unable to negotiate from a place of power with countries like Iran and Syria . There would also be a power vacuum left . Countries like Iraq and Afghanistan , as well as others that we have quieter relations with , would struggle to develop their militaries into an effective fighting force against the terrorist groups like ISIS operating in the area . I would estimate that within 12 months the Iraqi government would fail leading to a breeding ground for terrorists . Within 24 months the Afghani government would fail . I say this because Iraq is under a larger more immediate threat , where the Afghani government is in a more drawn out fight that is going to need US guidance over the coming years to develop their military properly . Essentially the entire region , even places that are relatively stable today like Jordan , could become failed states without a strong outside influence giving guidance on how to fight the Guerilla warfare tactics of these terrorist organizations . Now one might argue we 're clearly not good at fighting these groups if we 're still there . But the fact is we 've improved dramatically since 2001 when it comes to fighting these battles .

In general, it's likely that there would be a power vacuum left behind, as the U.S. military has played a significant role in maintaining stability and providing security in the region. Without the U.S. military presence, other countries or groups may try to fill the power vacuum and exert more influence in the region. This could lead to increased conflict and instability, as different groups compete for power. It's also possible that the withdrawal of U.S. troops could lead to a decrease in U.S. influence and credibility in the region, as other countries may see the U.S. as less committed to maintaining stability and security.",

    "answer": "The President of the United States is the highest elected office in the country, and as such, is often accorded a certain level of respect and formality in how they are addressed. \"Mr. President\" is a formal and respectful way to address the President, similar to how one might address someone as \"Mr.\" or \"Ms.\" as a sign of respect. Senators, on the other hand, are elected officials who hold a position in the legislative branch of government, but they do not hold the same level of executive power as the President. As a result, they are typically addressed simply as \"Senator,\" without the use of a honorific like \"Mr.\" or \"Ms.\".",

It's possible that the ad you're referring to is being displayed on a website, and the website is using HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to control how the content is displayed in the web browser. \nTo print something that large, you would need a special type of printer called a wide-format printer. These printers are designed to print on very large sheets of paper or other materials, such as vinyl or canvas. They are often used to print banners, posters, trade show graphics, wallpaper, murals, and other large-scale graphics. \nThere are several different technologies that wide-format printers use to print, including inkjet, thermal, and laser. Inkjet printers use jets of ink to apply the image to the printing material, while thermal printers use heat to transfer the image onto the material. Laser printers use a laser beam to transfer the image onto the material. \nWide-format printers are often used for advertising and marketing purposes, as well as for printing graphics for events, exhibitions, and other large-scale projects.

    "answer": "When a file becomes corrupt, it means that the data in the file has been damaged or altered in some way, and the file can no longer be used or accessed as it was intended. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as a power outage while the file is being saved, a problem with the storage device (like a memory card), or even a software bug. \nImagine that you have a box full of puzzle pieces, and each piece represents a piece of data in a file. When the file is \"healthy,\" all of the puzzle pieces fit together perfectly and you can see the whole picture. But if some of the puzzle pieces are damaged or missing, the picture becomes incomplete and you can't use it anymore. That's what it means for a file to be corrupt. \nIn the case of a memory card for a video game console like a PS2, a corrupt file could mean that you can't save your progress in a game or access certain features of the game.

This includes things like hiring professors and other staff, maintaining buildings and classrooms, providing resources like books and computers, and offering extracurricular activities and sports programs. \nColleges can offer scholarships to students as a way to attract talented students to their school. Scholarships are often funded by donations from individuals, businesses, or foundations that want to support education and help students afford the cost of tuition. Scholarships can also be funded by the college itself, using money from its budget or from tuition paid by other students. \nSo, when you receive a scholarship to go to college, you are not taking money away from anyone else.

    "answer": "The United States uses the Fahrenheit scale for measuring temperature because that is the scale that was originally used in the country. The Fahrenheit scale was developed by a German scientist named Gabriel Fahrenheit in the early 18th century. At the time, the rest of the world used the Celsius scale, which was developed by a Swedish scientist named Anders Celsius a few years earlier. \nThe reason the United States stuck with the Fahrenheit scale while the rest of the world switched to the Celsius scale has to do with the history of the country. When the United States was founded, it was a young, independent country that was looking to establish its own identity and create its own systems and standards. As a result, the country decided to use the Fahrenheit scale instead of the Celsius scale. \nToday, it would be more productive to use the same scale for measuring temperature across the globe, as it would make it easier for people to communicate and understand temperature measurements. However, changing the scale that is used in the United States would require a lot of effort and resources, as it would involve updating all of the temperature-related tools, equipment, and materials that are used in the country. It would also involve educating people about the new scale and helping them to understand how to use it. While it would be a worthwhile effort, it would likely take a long time to implement.",

    "question": "How police dispatch works . Listening to scanners for my major city and it seems like organized chaos . How do officers get necessary information like specific addresses or assigned to calls ? US resident Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Dispatcher here . I dispatch for a sheriffs office in a ski county . Our dispatch center dispatches for the county deputies , the state troopers , the park rangers , the wildlife officers , the US forest service officers , and local fire and EMS . As far dispatching law enforcement goes , each agency has a certain jurisdiction , and if a call happens in their jurisdiction we usually send one ( or multiple ) units depending on the call . For example the state troopers take all of the calls on the state roads and interstates ( accidents , traffic violations , road hazards , suspicious vehicles on the interstate , etc ) . The county deputies take all of the calls on county roads , and county property . These calls may include domestic violence calls at a citizens houses , burglary alarms , citizen complains against each other , welfare checks , and civil problems . They also patrol the area proactively trying to prevent crime . They have a job very similar to a city police officer . The park rangers take care of all of the problems in state park jurisdiction , and the wildlife officers generally ride around on ATVS and look for poachers , and take care of the wildlife people encounter on their property . The US forest officer takes the calls in the national forest in our jurisdiction and patrols the highway the passes through it . He may also receive help from our deputies if need be because we have a deputy whose zone passes through his national forest . We also have a local police department in the area , but their dispatch is in another location and we occasionally coordinate . We can hear each others radio traffic , but do n't dispatch each others officers . Now , there are about 6 troopers ( Highway patrol ) on air in the busiest time , and they are separated into 3 zones . Each trooper is assigned a zone , and if we receive a call in their zone we generally ask them to respond . If all the troopers in their zone are unavailable , we ask the officer in charge to advise . The deputies have 4 zones with 6 deputies on duty . 4 deputies have their own zone ( so one in each zone ) and there is a float who will respond to any call if an officer is busy , and another call comes in in their zone . There is also a SGT on duty who is the boss of the crew . If a call comes in their zone , they are dispatched to it , and if deputies from another zone come to assist , the officer who is assigned to that zone will be in charge of the call ( write the big report , and if needed , take the prisoner into the jail ) . When we take a call our system automatically recognizes the address and maps it for us , and we can see whose zone it is in , and we send that unit . Generally , there is a unit available to assist if they need backup , and all officers in every agency will back each other if they feel they are in a dangerous situation . We have a computer aided dispatch system that tracks all of the calls , and what every unit is doing , so we know if they are available , unavailable , their location and how long they have been on that call so we can security check them if need be . I 'm not going into detail with any other agency besides the highway patrol and Sherrifs deputies because they all pretty much have one zone . I hope this covers at least a small chunk of curiosity . Feel free to ask more questions , because I 'm sure I 've probably made no sense . Oh , and they know the address because it shows up on their mobile dispatch center on their computer in their vehicle , and we always tell them when we dispatch them on the call .",

    "answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to explain how police dispatch works! \nWhen someone calls the police to report a problem or ask for help, the call goes to a special place called the \"police dispatch center.\" This is where people, called \"dispatchers,\" answer the phone and take down all the important information about the call. \nThe dispatcher asks the caller questions to get more details about what happened, where it happened, and whether anyone is hurt or in danger. The dispatcher then writes down all this information and sends it to the police officers who are closest to the place where the problem is happening. \nThe dispatcher also gives the police officers important details about the call, like the specific address of the place where the problem is happening or any description of the person involved. This helps the officers know where to go and what to look for when they get there. \nThe police officers use special radios to talk to the dispatcher and each other, so they can communicate and stay updated on what's happening. This is what you might be hearing on a scanner if you're listening to one. \nI hope this helps to clear things up! Let me know if you have any more questions.",

    "answer": "Split screen co-op gaming is a feature that allows players to play a game together on the same screen, with each player having their own section of the screen to see and control their own character or vehicle. This feature was popular in many games up until a few years ago, but it has become less common in recent years for a few reasons. \nOne reason is that many newer games are designed to be played online, rather than in person with another player sitting next to you on the same couch. This means that players can play the game together even if they are not in the same physical location, as long as they both have an internet connection. \nAnother reason is that split screen co-op can be more challenging for game developers to implement. It requires a lot of extra work to design the game in a way that allows two players to see and control their own characters on the same screen, and this can take up a lot of development time and resources. \nFinally, some people argue that split screen co-op is not as popular as it used to be because the trend in gaming has moved towards online multiplayer, which allows for a larger number of players to play together at the same time. \nOverall, split screen co-op is still possible in some games, but it is not as common as it used to be due to the increasing popularity of online multiplayer and the extra development work required to implement split screen co-op.",

    "answer": "Bison are a type of large, hoofed animal that are native to North America. They are related to cows, but they are generally bigger and can produce more meat per animal. Bison are also known for being hardy animals that can survive in a variety of climates and environments. \nHowever, there are a few reasons why bison are not raised as widely as cows for meat production. One reason is that bison are generally slower to mature than cows, which means that it takes longer for them to reach slaughter weight. This means that it takes longer for farmers to raise bison for meat compared to cows. \nAnother reason is that bison can be more challenging to raise than cows. They are generally more independent and can be more difficult to handle, which can make it harder for farmers to manage them. In addition, bison require more space to roam and graze, which can be a challenge for farmers who have limited land available. \nFinally, bison can also consume more feed than cows, which can be more expensive for farmers. Overall, while bison have some advantages as a source of meat, they are generally not as practical to raise as cows for a variety of reasons.",

Subsidies are payments or other forms of financial assistance that the government gives to certain industries or businesses to help them stay afloat or to encourage them to produce certain products. \nIn the case of corn, the government provides subsidies to corn farmers to help them cover their costs and to keep the price of corn low. This makes it cheaper for companies to produce corn syrup, which is made from corn, and therefore also makes it cheaper for consumers to buy. \nSo, in short, corn syrup is cheaper than sugar in the United States because the government helps to keep the price of corn low by providing subsidies to corn farmers.

The illustrations that probably will make it clear : [ 1 ] ( URL_2 ) , [ 2 ] ( URL_1 ) . When music is played back , the audio card converts this sequence of numbers back into the wave . Obviously , this conversion loses some quality : the resulting wave is an approximation of the original one .

    "question": "Audio Bit Depth ( 16 bit , 24 bit , etc . ) I 'm having trouble understanding the difference between recording in 16 bit or 24 bit and what that means for me and my music . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Bit depth refers to the number of bits used to represent the amplitude (loudness) of a audio signal at a given point in time. The higher the bit depth, the more accurately the signal can be represented, which can result in a higher quality audio recording. \nA bit depth of 16 bits means that there are 16 bits available to represent the amplitude of the audio signal at each point in time. This allows for a total of 65,536 possible amplitude values, which is a relatively fine level of resolution. \nA bit depth of 24 bits means that there are 24 bits available to represent the amplitude of the audio signal at each point in time. This allows for a total of 16,777,216 possible amplitude values, which is a much finer level of resolution than 16 bits. \nIn general, recordings made at a higher bit depth will have a higher quality and more dynamic range (the difference between the loudest and quietest parts of the recording). However, it's important to note that the benefits of higher bit depths may not be audible to most listeners, especially if the recording is played back on equipment with a lower bit depth or quality.",

    "answer": "Molecular orbital theory is a way of understanding how the electrons in a molecule are arranged and how they behave. It helps us predict things like the shape of the molecule and how stable it is. \nImagine that you have a bunch of balls that you want to stack on top of each other. Each ball represents an electron. The balls are attracted to each other because of the electrical charge they carry, and they want to be as close together as possible. \nIn molecular orbital theory, we try to understand how the balls (electrons) are arranged in the stack (molecule) by creating \"orbital\" shapes that the balls can fit into. Each orbital can hold a certain number of balls, just like how a bucket can hold a certain number of marbles. \nThe shapes of the orbitals are determined by the behavior of the electrons in the molecule. Some orbitals are more stable than others, which means the balls (electrons) are less likely to fall out of them. This can help us understand why some molecules are more stable than others. \nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.",

    "question": "Why is n't one 's appendix removed at birth when all it can do is burst open and kill the person ? Is it the cost or safety issues ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The appendix is a small, tube-like organ that is located in the lower right side of the abdomen. It is not typically removed at birth because it does not always cause problems and can actually have some functions in the body. In some cases, the appendix can become inflamed and infected, which is called appendicitis. If this happens, the appendix can burst, or rupture, and release harmful bacteria into the abdominal cavity. This can be very serious and can lead to life-threatening infections. \nIn most cases, appendicitis is treated by removing the appendix through a surgical procedure called an appendectomy. This is usually done if the appendix is infected or if there is a high risk of it bursting. The decision to remove the appendix is usually based on the severity of the appendicitis and the overall health of the person. \nIt is not safe or necessary to remove the appendix at birth because most people do not develop appendicitis. In fact, removing the appendix when it is not necessary can lead to complications and can be expensive.",

    "question": "How does hand soap actually work ? Some modern soaps obviously contain alcohol to kill bacteria , but what about the old blocks of massive soap ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Sure! So, soap is made from a combination of oils or fats and an alkali, like lye. When you mix these two ingredients together and heat them up, a chemical reaction occurs that turns the mixture into soap. \nSoap works by breaking up the oils and dirt on your skin into smaller pieces, and then washing them away with water. The oils in soap are attracted to the dirt and oils on your skin, so when you rinse with water, the soap helps carry the dirt and oils away. \nAlkali is a type of chemical that can dissolve grease and oil, so it helps to break down the dirt and oils on your skin. This is why soap is especially good at cleaning your hands, which can get really dirty and greasy from handling food, using tools, and so on. \nThe soap that you see in bars or blocks is called \"bar soap.\" It's made by mixing the oils or fats and alkali together, and then letting the mixture harden in a mold. \nI hope this helps to explain how soap works!

    "question": "What exactly does ' port forwarding ' do ? what are these ports and why do they need forwarding Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "TLDR - ports are mailboxes . Port forwarding forwards the mail from mailbox X to mailbox Y. Think of ports as mailboxes . Let 's say you wanted to hand deliver a letter to Joe at the Acme Brick company . You would go to the address of the Acme Brick Company . The company employs 5,000 people . So you would see a grid of boxes with people 's names on them . You find the one that belongs to Joe and you put the letter in there . This is kind of how computer 's talk to each other . The street address is the IP address of the computer ( say 192.168.1.1 ) and the grid of mailboxes is the port . If you want to talk to a computer via http , you would send your information and requests to port 80 . If you wanted to talk to them with a different protocol like RDP , you would talk to 3389 . If you wanted to talk to the SMTP service on that computer , you 'd talk to port 25 . You are going to that computer and putting your correspondence in a particular mailbox ( port ) . Now , let 's say that Joe is a secret agent who works for the Acme Brick Company . To you , he 's known as Joe . To everyone inside the company , he 's known as Bob . This identity may be so super - secret that Bob does n't even know what name you know him by . You just know him as Joe . You want to talk to Joe so you go to the Acme Brick Company , you find their grid of mailboxes and you put your letter in Joe 's mailbox . Some poor mail clerk on the other side ( your router ) know 's Joe 's secret identity . So he takes the mail from Joe 's box and put 's it in Bob 's mailbox . This way Bob can pick it up .

    "question": "What exactly does ' port forwarding ' do ? what are these ports and why do they need forwarding Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "In a computer network, a \"port\" is a specific place where data can be sent or received by a computer or device. When data is sent over the internet or other networks, it is divided into small packets and each packet is sent to its destination through a specific port. \nSometimes, a device or computer on a network might have certain services or applications that need to receive data from the internet. For example, a computer might have a web server running on it that needs to receive data from the internet so that other people can access the website hosted on that computer. In this case, the computer would need to have a specific port open to receive data from the internet. \n\"Port forwarding\" is a process that allows a device or computer to receive data from the internet through a specific port. When you \"forward a port,\" you are telling your router or network device to send data that comes in through a specific port to a specific device on your network. \nFor example, let's say you have a computer on your network that is running a web server. You might want to forward port 80 (the default port for HTTP traffic) to that computer so that people can access the website hosted on that computer from the internet. In this case, you would set up port forwarding on your router so that any data that comes in through port 80 is sent to the computer running the web server. \nIn summary, port forwarding allows you to receive data from the internet on a specific port on your device or computer, which can be useful if you are running certain services or applications that need to receive data from the internet.",

  {
    "question": "How is Gravity Equivalent to Acceleration ? ( General Relativity ) Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Sure! In general relativity, gravity is not a force that acts between masses like it is in classical physics. Instead, gravity is a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of matter or energy. Imagine that spacetime is like a rubber sheet, and objects with mass or energy cause a depression in the rubber sheet. The curvature of the rubber sheet then causes other objects to be \"pulled\" towards the massive object, as if it were a gravitational force. \nNow, imagine that you are standing on a trampoline with a bowling ball in the center. If you were to roll a smaller ball towards the bowling ball, the smaller ball would be \"pulled\" towards the bowling ball due to the depression in the trampoline caused by the bowling ball's mass. This is similar to how objects are \"pulled\" towards each other due to gravity in general relativity. \nBut what does this have to do with acceleration? In classical physics, acceleration is the rate at which an object's velocity changes over time. In general relativity, an object's velocity is determined by the path it follows through spacetime. If the path is curved, the object will appear to be accelerating, even if it is not actually changing its velocity. \nFor example, imagine that you are standing on the trampoline again, but this time you are rolling a ball in a straight line towards the bowling ball. As the ball approaches the bowling ball, it will start to follow the curve of the trampoline, and it will appear to be accelerating towards the bowling ball. This is similar to how an object orbiting a massive object, like the Earth orbiting the Sun, appears to be accelerating towards the Sun, even though it is actually following a straight path through curved spacetime. \nI hope this helps!

    "question": "How do loading bars work ? Why do they work so badly ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Imagine you are in class and your teacher asks you to write all of the capital letters of the alphabet four times - A A A A B B B B C C C C .... You know that you 'll have to write a little more than 100 letters on the page . You can guess how long it takes you to write a single letter , but writing can sometimes be faster or slower . This is true for computers too . A loading bar in computers is basically the same as the teacher asking you every second , \" JPK , how much time do you still need to finish writing your letters ? \" If you took 2 seconds to write the first letter , and you need to write 100 , you could guess that you need 198 seconds to finish . But if it took you 3 seconds for the letter B ( curves ! ) or 1 second for the letter C ( do n't need to lift the pencil ! ) then your guesses will be a little bit wrong every time . Now what happens if you drop your pencil ? ( In this analogy , after flushing data to disk , the computer switched tasks to take care of something of higher priority , like opening the reddit home page in your browser ) Suddenly your time changes a little bit more because you have to take time to pick up your pencil ( task switch ) , or to sharpen your pencil ( file seeking ) , or to erase a mistake ( error checking ) , or to write your name on the assignment ( file system journaling ) or to put a page down and get a new page ( storing in cache or page memory ) . It was very easy to guess when you only had to think about how fast you wrote the first letter .... but clearly it is n't enough information to figure out the entire time remaining . ---- As far as the last 1 % goes , this is kind of like doing your entire assignment first before you write your name and date and class and give your pages to the teacher . The loading bar usually estimates time remaining based on the task it represents , since it can actually be measured by looking at past progress . That last percent often includes tasks that can not be measured . For example , when you download files , they are usually downloaded to a temp directory first , then moved to the real destination ( or they are downloaded at the real directory but with a fake extension , like myfile.jpg.part ; then the file is renamed to myfile.jpg when the download is complete ) .",

    "question": "How do loading bars work ? Why do they work so badly ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "A loading bar is a visual representation of how much of a task has been completed. It's often used when a computer or website is doing a lot of work, such as loading a webpage or downloading a file. The loading bar shows you how much of the work has been done and how much is left to do. \nSometimes loading bars don't work very well because the task they are showing the progress of is taking a long time to complete. This can be because the computer or website is busy doing other things, or because the task is just very large and takes a long time to finish. \nAnother reason loading bars might not work very well is if they are not programmed correctly. If the loading bar is not accurately showing the progress of the task, it can be frustrating for the person using the computer or website. \nOverall, loading bars are a useful tool for showing how much progress has been made on a task, but they can sometimes be slow or not work correctly if the task is taking a long time to complete or if they are not programmed correctly.",

    "answer": "The CIA torture program, also known as the enhanced interrogation program, was a program run by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the years following the 9/11 attacks in which terrorism suspects were subjected to various forms of torture and other forms of abuse. The program has been the subject of controversy because many people believe that torture is wrong, regardless of the circumstances. \nThere are several reasons why people are angry about the CIA torture program: \n1. Many people believe that torture is wrong because it goes against fundamental human rights and dignity. The United States has long held that all people have certain inalienable rights, including the right to be free from torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. By torturing terrorism suspects, the CIA was violating these fundamental rights. \n2. The effectiveness of torture as an interrogation technique has been called into question. Many experts believe that torture is not an effective way to gather reliable information, as people who are being tortured will often say anything to make the torture stop, even if it is not true. In addition, the use of torture can create a climate of fear and mistrust, which can make it more difficult to gather accurate intelligence. \n3. The CIA torture program was carried out in secret, and many people believe that it was done in an effort to cover up the program and avoid accountability. When governments operate in secret, it can be difficult for citizens to hold them accountable for their actions, and this can undermine trust in government and the rule of law. \n4. The CIA torture program has also been criticized because it was carried out at detention facilities in other countries, including countries with a history of human rights abuses. This has led some people to question whether the United States is upholding its own values and principles when it comes to human rights. \nOverall, the CIA torture program has been a source of controversy because it involves the use of torture and other forms of abuse, which many people believe is wrong, and because it was carried out in secret and may have violated fundamental human rights.",

    "answer": "Stars twinkle because of the Earth's atmosphere. The light from a star travels through the atmosphere to reach us on the ground. As the light travels through the atmosphere, it can be affected by different layers of air with different temperatures and densities. This can cause the light to bend or scatter in different directions. \nWhen you see a star twinkling, what you're actually seeing is the light from the star being affected by the Earth's atmosphere as it travels through it. The twinkling effect is caused by the light being scattered in different directions as it passes through the atmosphere, which makes it appear to be flashing or changing in brightness. \nIt's important to note that the star itself is not actually twinkling or changing in brightness. It's just the way the light from the star is being affected as it travels through the Earth's atmosphere that makes it appear to be twinkling.",

    "answer": "The GPA system is a way of measuring academic achievement in the United States that assigns a numerical value to a student's grades. The 4-point GPA scale is the most commonly used scale in the United States, and it assigns a numerical value to each letter grade, with 4.0 being the highest possible GPA and 0.0 being the lowest. \nThere are a few reasons why the GPA system is used in the United States instead of percentage grades. First, the GPA system allows for a more nuanced understanding of a student's grades. While a percentage grade gives a general idea of how well a student has performed, the GPA system allows for more precise comparisons between students. \nSecond, the GPA system is more flexible than percentage grades. For example, if a student receives a 90% on one assignment and an 80% on another, their average percentage grade would be 85%. However, if the first assignment was worth twice as much as the second assignment, the student's grades would be weighted differently, and the GPA would reflect that. \nFinally, the GPA system is more widely used in the United States, so it is easier for universities to compare the grades of students from different schools. This can be particularly helpful when evaluating the academic achievements of international students, as different countries may use different grading systems. \nOverall, the GPA system is a convenient and widely accepted way of measuring academic achievement in the United States. It allows for more precise comparisons between students and is more flexible than percentage grades.",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why McDonald's may get more negative publicity compared to other fast food chains. \nOne reason is that McDonald's is the largest and most well-known fast food chain in the world. Because it is so big and has so many locations, it is more likely to attract attention and criticism. \nAnother reason is that McDonald's has been around for a long time, and as the fast food industry has changed and evolved over the years, McDonald's has faced criticism for its food and business practices. For example, some people have criticized McDonald's for using processed and unhealthy ingredients in its food, or for contributing to environmental problems due to its large scale. \nIt's also possible that McDonald's has simply faced more criticism and negative publicity because it is an easy target. Some people may be more likely to speak out against McDonald's because it is a well-known and established company, rather than a smaller or less well-known chain. \nIt's important to remember that all fast food, including McDonald's, can be unhealthy if consumed in large amounts. It's important to eat a balanced diet and to make healthy choices, regardless of where you are eating.",

    "answer": "The European diet before the Columbian exchange was a mixture of various local foods, including grains such as wheat and barley, vegetables like carrots, turnips, and peas, and fruits like apples and pears. Meat was also an important part of the diet, with animals like cows, pigs, and chickens being raised for their meat, milk, and eggs. Fish was also a common source of protein, especially in coastal regions. In addition to these staples, people also ate a variety of nuts, seeds, and legumes, and some people kept bees for honey. \nThe Columbian exchange was the exchange of plants, animals, and diseases between the Old World (Europe, Africa, and Asia) and the New World (the Americas) that occurred after Christopher Columbus's voyages to the Americas in the late 15th century. As a result of this exchange, many new foods were introduced to the Old World, including tomatoes, potatoes, corn, beans, and chocolate, which have now become important parts of modern European cuisine.",

    "answer": "Tofu, also known as bean curd, is a food made from soybeans. It is a staple in many vegetarian and vegan diets because it is a good source of protein and other nutrients. \nTofu is made by grinding soybeans and mixing them with water to make a liquid called soy milk. The soy milk is then mixed with a coagulant, which causes it to curdle and form solid chunks. These chunks are then pressed and molded into blocks or other shapes. \nBecause tofu is fairly bland on its own, it can be made to taste like a wide variety of foods by adding different seasonings, sauces, and marinades. For example, tofu can be flavored to taste like chicken, beef, or fish by using the right combination of spices and sauces. Tofu can also be grilled, stir-fried, or added to soups and stews to give it more flavor. \nOverall, tofu is a versatile food that can be used in many different dishes and can be made to taste like a variety of different flavors.",

    "answer": "The more mass something has , the more force it feels from gravity ( i.e. the more it weighs ) . However , the object 's * inertia * ( its resistance to being moved ) increases with mass , as well . When an object is dropped , the increased force of gravity from its mass is exactly canceled out by the increased resistance to movement from its mass , and , all other things being equal ( i.e. with no air resistance ) , all objects will fall at the same speed ) . * * * * * Here , have some math : Equation for gravitational force : F = ( G \\ * m*_1 _ * \\ * m*_2 _ * ) / r^(2 ) Equation for force from acceleration : F = m \\ * a Let 's mark which mass is the earth , and which is the object : F = ( G \\ * m*_object _ * \\ * m*_earth _ * ) / r^(2 ) F = m*_object _ * \\ * a Now let 's substitute the second equation into the first : m*_object _ * \\ * a = ( G \\ * m*_object _ * \\ * m*_earth _ * ) / r^(2 ) Divide both sides by m*_object _ * : ( m*_object _ * \\ * a ) / m*_object _ * = ( G \\ * m*_object _ * \\ * m*_earth _ * ) / ( r^(2 ) \\ * m*_object _ * ) Cancel out m*_object _ * on each side : ( ~~m*_object_*~~ \\ * a ) / ~~m*_object_*~~ = ( G \\ * ~~m*_object_*~~ \\ * m*_earth _ * ) / ( r^(2 ) \\ * ~~m*_object_*~~ ) And we 're left with : a = ( G \\ * m*_earth _ * ) / r^(2 ) So the acceleration of an object on Earth ( ignoring drag ) depends only on the mass of the Earth , its distance from the Earth , and the gravitational constant , G.

    "answer": "In a vacuum, objects fall at the same speed regardless of their mass because there is no air resistance to slow them down. This is known as the principle of universal gravitation. \nImagine you are standing on a tall building and you drop a feather and a coin at the same time. Without air resistance, the feather and the coin will fall to the ground at the same speed. This is because the only force acting on them is the force of gravity, which is pulling them towards the ground. The mass of the feather and the coin does not affect how fast they fall, only the force of gravity does. \nNow, if you were to drop the feather and the coin in air (not in a vacuum), the feather would fall more slowly than the coin because the air would create a resistance force that slows the feather down. The coin, being more dense and heavier, would not be slowed down as much by the air and would therefore fall faster than the feather. \nI hope this helps!

    "answer": "Sending large emails with attachments can be difficult because of the way that email works. When you send an email, it has to travel from your computer or device to the email server and then to the recipient's email server. Along the way, it can pass through many different servers and networks, and each of these servers and networks has limited resources. If the attachment is too large, it can use up too much of the resources of these servers and networks, making it difficult to send the email. \nAdditionally, many email providers have size limits on the attachments that you can send in order to prevent people from sending very large attachments that could cause problems for the servers and networks. These size limits are often set to around 10 MB or less to ensure that emails can be sent and received quickly and reliably. \nSo, while we do have the technology to send large attachments, it can be difficult because of the way that email works and the need to ensure that it is fast and reliable for everyone who uses it.",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why a movie that seems destined to be awful might still get made. \nOne reason is that studios sometimes believe that a movie will be successful based on the success of a previous movie in the series. For example, if the first \"Dumb and Dumber\" movie was a big hit, the studio might think that the sequel, \"Dumb and Dumber To,\" will also be a hit, even if it turns out not to be very good. \nAnother reason is that studios often invest a lot of money in making a movie, and they want to try to recoup their investment by releasing the movie in theaters. Even if a movie is not very good, the studio might still try to make some money back by releasing it in theaters. \nFinally, it's important to remember that making a movie is a risky business, and not every movie will be a hit.

    "answer": "Emissivity is a measure of how well an object is able to emit or radiate heat. Some materials are better at emitting heat than others. A material's emissivity can be increased by making its surface rougher, or by painting it a darker color. \nFlat black paint is often used to increase an object's emissivity because it absorbs a large amount of light and heat. When an object is painted black, it absorbs more of the energy that hits its surface, rather than reflecting it back. This absorbed energy can then be radiated back out as heat, which can help to cool the object. \nHeat sinks are designed to dissipate or spread out heat to help cool electronic devices. While painting a heat sink flat black could increase its emissivity, it might not be the most effective way to cool the device. This is because heat sinks rely on air flow to dissipate heat, and a flat black paint job could interfere with this air flow. In addition, the heat sink might get too hot to touch if it is painted black, which could be a safety issue. \nOverall, painting something flat black can increase its emissivity, but it might not always be the best solution for cooling an object.",

    "question": "in video games , why are shadows so hard to render ? I notice that even in games with incredibly detailed graphics shadows are often pixelated or very low resolution . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Drawing shadows is hard . The way shadows are calculated is by placing a second camera at the light source , and then rendering the scene from the light source 's point of view into a temporary location . The image that is produced is not a typical \" camera image \" . Instead every pixel of this image records the distance between the light source and the object hit by the light - this is called a \" shadow map \" . Once you have this shadow map , the regular scene is drawn . While drawing the regular scene , it has to calculate the lighting for each pixel in the regular scene . Let 's say a particular pixel on the regular scene represents location X in the scene ( it has an exact 3D location in the scene ) . The distance of location X to the light source is compared against the distance recorded in the shadow map , this determines whether location X is in shadow or not . In other words , rendering shadows requires rendering an extra scene ( the shadow map ) for * each * light source in the scene , greatly reducing FPS . So a game with just one light source with accurate shadows would have its FPS halved , 2 light sources would cause FPS to be reduced to 1/3 . This is somewhat circumvented by rendering low resolution shadow maps instead ( less pixels to render per shadow map ) , resulting in pixelated or low resolution shadows , because each pixel on the shadow map covers a \" larger \" area . Edit : Halving and 1/3 FPS is a huge exaggeration , it is not that bad ( because ELI5 ) , it ignores the CPU side of calculating the scene , updating AIs , etc . The point I 'm driving across is simply that more scenes are drawn per frame .",

    "answer": "Rendering shadows in video games can be challenging because it requires the computer to calculate how the light in the virtual environment should interact with the objects in the scene.

    "answer": "Irish music and pirate music share some similarities, but they are ultimately quite different. Irish music is a traditional genre of music that originated in Ireland and is characterized by its use of instruments like the fiddle, tin whistle, and bodhran (a type of drum). It is often fast-paced and upbeat, and often includes dancing. \nPirate music, on the other hand, is a fictional genre of music that is often associated with pirates in popular culture (such as in movies and books). Pirate music is usually fast-paced and energetic, and often incorporates elements of folk music and sea shanties. \nIt's possible that the reason you associate Irish music with pirate music is because they both have fast tempos and use similar instruments. However, they are distinct genres of music with their own unique histories and cultural roots.",

    "answer": "Marijuana, also known as cannabis, is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States because it is considered to have a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use. The classification of a drug as a Schedule I controlled substance is based on the results of scientific and medical research, as well as other factors such as the drug's potential for dependence and the likelihood of it being diverted for non-medical use. \nThere is evidence to suggest that marijuana may have some potential therapeutic benefits for certain medical conditions, such as chronic pain, nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, and muscle spasms and spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis. However, more research is needed to fully understand the risks and benefits of using marijuana for medical purposes and to determine the most effective doses and methods of administration. \nIt is important to note that the classification of a drug as a Schedule I controlled substance does not necessarily mean that it has no medical value. Rather, it means that the drug has a high potential for abuse and has not yet been fully studied and approved for medical use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In some cases, drugs that are initially classified as Schedule I controlled substances may be reclassified if more research is conducted and it is determined that they have a medical use and a low potential for abuse.",

    "answer": "It is not acceptable for anyone to enter a private space, such as a locker room or restroom, with the intention of harassing or disturbing others. However, it is perfectly acceptable for a person to use the restroom or locker room that aligns with their gender identity. \nAllowing people to use the facilities that correspond with their gender identity is a matter of basic dignity and respect. It is not about sexual attraction. It is about allowing people to use the facilities that match the gender they identify as, so that they can go about their daily lives with privacy and comfort. \nThink about it this way: if you were a man who identified as a woman, would you feel comfortable using the men's locker room? Probably not. The same is true for a woman who identifies as a man.

Typically , American sandwiches are focused on combinations of meats and cheeses . All that fat can be balanced out with a bite of something acidic .

    "answer": "A black hole is a place in space where the normal laws of physics break down. It's a place where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape from it, not even light. Black holes are formed when a star collapses, or collapses in on itself, at the end of its life. \nImagine you have a ball that is really heavy. The ball has so much mass, or weight, that it makes a deep dent in the ground when you drop it. Now imagine a ball that is even heavier. It would make an even deeper dent in the ground. Now imagine a ball that is so heavy, it makes a dent that is so deep, it goes all the way through the ground and keeps going. That's what a black hole is like. It's a place where the pull of gravity is so strong that it sucks everything in and doesn't let it escape. \nBlack holes come in different sizes. The smallest ones are called \"stellar\" black holes and are only a few times heavier than our sun. The largest ones are called \"supermassive\" black holes and can be billions of times heavier than our sun. Scientists have found evidence of black holes in our own galaxy and in many other galaxies. They are still studying and learning more about them, but we know that black holes are some of the strangest and most mysterious objects in the universe.",

    "answer": "Libertarianism is a political philosophy that advocates for individual freedom and limited government intervention in people's lives. Libertarians believe that people should be free to make their own choices and decisions, as long as they do not harm others. They generally support a smaller government that does not interfere with people's personal or economic affairs, and believe in the importance of private property and free markets. \nThere is no one type of person who is into libertarianism. Some libertarians may be wealthy, while others may not be. Some may be conservative, while others may be liberal. Libertarians come from all walks of life and may have a variety of different beliefs and values. \nIn a libertarian society, the government would have a limited role and would not regulate or control many aspects of people's lives. Instead, individuals would be free to make their own choices and decisions about how to live their lives. People would be able to own and control their own property, and the economy would be based on free markets and voluntary exchange. There would be no taxes or other forms of coercion used to force people to do things they do not want to do. \nOverall, the goal of libertarianism is to create a society in which individuals are free to live their lives as they see fit, as long as they do not harm others.",

    "answer": "When you download a file using a torrent client, your computer connects to other computers that have also downloaded or are downloading the same file. These computers, called \"peers,\" share small pieces of the file with each other. When you download a file using a torrent, your computer sends and receives data from these peers, which can be traced back to your internet connection. \nYour ISP (Suddenlink) is able to see this data being transferred and can determine that you are using a torrent client to download files. Some ISPs have policies in place that prohibit the use of torrents on their networks, and they may take action, such as disconnecting your internet, if they detect that you are using a torrent client. \nIt's important to note that downloading copyrighted material using a torrent client without permission from the copyright holder is illegal in many countries. Some ISPs may take action if they believe that you are downloading copyrighted material without permission, even if they do not have a specific policy against the use of torrents.",

    "answer": "It's possible that both AT&T and Verizon believe that they offer the best 4G LTE service because they may have different ways of measuring the quality of their service. For example, one company may consider factors such as the availability of their service in different areas, the speed of their network, or the reliability of their service when making claims about the quality of their 4G LTE service. \nIt's also possible that both companies are accurate in their claims, as different factors may be more important to different people. Some people may prioritize having a fast network, while others may prioritize having a reliable network that is available in more areas. \nUltimately, it's difficult to say definitively which company has the \"better\" 4G LTE service, as different people may have different priorities and experiences with the service. It might be helpful to do some research and compare the different plans and coverage maps offered by both companies to determine which one is the best fit for your specific needs and location.",

    "answer": "The \"I Can Be A Computer Engineer\" Barbie book has been criticized for perpetuating harmful stereotypes about computer engineers and for promoting a narrow and unrealistic view of what it means to be a computer engineer. \nOne issue with the book is that it portrays Barbie as the main character who is responsible for all the technical work, while her classmates are shown as simply helping her or providing support. This reinforces the stereotype that computer engineering is a field for men and that women are only helpers or assistants. \nAnother issue is that the book portrays computer engineering as a solitary activity, rather than a collaborative and team-based discipline. In reality, computer engineering involves working with a diverse team of people with a range of skills and expertise, and often involves collaboration and communication with others. \nOverall, the \"I Can Be A Computer Engineer\" Barbie book promotes a limited and one-dimensional view of what it means to be a computer engineer, and does not accurately reflect the diverse and collaborative nature of the field.",

    "answer": "They are actually sailing parallel to the wind and/or upwind , which is not with the flow of the wind . The sails act like a wing , creating lift which is counteracted by the keel to result in forward motion .

    "question": "How do sail boats go faster than the wind ? The Americas Cup sailboats can go nearly 2 times windspeed . How do they go faster than the wind is blowing them ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Sailboats can go faster than the wind because they use the wind to propel themselves through the water. The wind pushes against the sails, which causes the boat to move forward. \nImagine you are holding a piece of paper in your hand and you blow on it. The paper will move in the direction that you are blowing. Now imagine you are holding a cardboard box in your hand and you blow on it. The box will not move as easily as the paper because it is much heavier and more difficult to push. \nSailboats work in a similar way. The wind pushes against the sails, but the boat is much heavier than the paper, so it doesn't move as easily. However, the shape of the sails is designed to catch the wind and use its energy to propel the boat forward. The keel, which is a long, heavy fin that extends from the bottom of the boat, helps to keep the boat upright and moving in a straight line. \nSo, to summarize, sailboats go faster than the wind because they use the wind to propel themselves through the water. The shape of the sails and the weight of the boat work together to harness the wind's energy and turn it into forward motion.",

    "answer": "When we miss someone we care about, it can feel like a physical ache or pain in our bodies. This is because our brains and bodies are closely connected, and intense emotional experiences can sometimes be translated into physical sensations. \nFor example, when we are feeling strong emotions like love, sadness, or longing, the brain releases certain chemicals that can affect our bodies. These chemicals can cause physical changes such as increased heart rate, tense muscles, and changes in blood pressure. \nIn the case of missing someone, these physical sensations can be a result of the brain and body reacting to the emotional pain of being separated from someone we care about. It's a natural response to feeling a sense of loss or longing for someone we love. \nIt's important to remember that these physical sensations are normal and will eventually go away as we adapt to the change in our lives. Taking care of ourselves, staying connected to others, and finding healthy ways to cope with our emotions can all help us to feel better and move through this difficult time.",

    "answer": "Professional athletes, especially those in popular sports like basketball, football, and baseball, have always been paid well. However, the salaries of professional athletes have increased significantly over the years due to a variety of factors. \nOne reason for the increase in salaries is the growth of the sports industry. As more people watch sports and attend games, the demand for professional athletes has increased, which has led to higher salaries. Additionally, television contracts and sponsorships have also contributed to the growth of the sports industry and the increase in athlete salaries. \nAnother reason for the high salaries of professional athletes is the competition among teams to sign the best players. Teams are willing to pay top dollar for the best players in order to improve their chances of winning games and championships. \nIt's also important to note that professional athletes have a limited window of time to make a career in their sport, as their careers are often shorter than those in other industries. This can also contribute to their desire to make as much money as possible while they are still able to compete at a high level. \nOverall, the high salaries of professional athletes can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the growth of the sports industry, competition among teams, and the limited career window for athletes.",

    "answer": "The celebration of Christmas on December 25th is based on the belief that Jesus Christ, the central figure of Christianity, was born on that day. However, there is no biblical evidence to suggest that Jesus was actually born on December 25th. In fact, it is likely that Jesus was born in the spring or summer, since shepherds in the region where Jesus was born would not have been tending their flocks at night in the colder winter months. \nSo why do we celebrate Christmas on December 25th then? The exact reason is not known for certain, but it is thought that the early Christian church chose this date in order to Christianize an existing pagan holiday that was also celebrated around this time of year. The pagan holiday, called Saturnalia, was a celebration of the winter solstice and the god Saturn. By setting the celebration of Jesus' birth on December 25th, the early Christian church was able to incorporate elements of this existing holiday into the celebration of Christmas, which helped to spread the message of Christianity to a wider audience. \nI hope this helps to explain why we celebrate Christmas on December 25th, even though it is unlikely that this is the actual day that Jesus was born.",

    "question": "The logic behind raising taxes for the poor and cutting them for the rich ? Thanks for the answers ! It makes a lot more sense now . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The logic , albeit flawed , is that the \" poor \" ( who generally work for the \" rich \" ) do n't pay their fair share ( to an extent this is true ) , and that reducing taxes on the rich encourages them to invest it into things that create jobs for the poor . The idea is that by making the rich richer , wealth will \" trickle down \" to the poor . Hence the phrase \" trickle down economics . \" This has been shown to not actually work in real life . The only reason the rich are rich is because the poor ( the vast majority of the population , and therefore the vast majority of customers ) have money to spend on things that the rich make and sell . Further , when you consider that the poor SPEND most of their income , and the rich either hoard or invest it , it makes sense to use higher taxes to lift the tax burden off the poor so the economy can keep running . It also makes sense to use taxes to encourage the rich to invest their money into companies that build things and employ people instead of investing it into things that turn money into more money for no real work ( buying real estate , stocks , bonds ) , or worse , hoarding it in trust funds and offshore bank accounts ( often to avoid paying taxes on it ) . Yes , the richest people often pay more in taxes than the poor make in a year . BUT , when you consider that the rich are only rich because of the infrastructure that our tax dollars built it 's only fair that they pay a larger share . If there was no public education system , you would n't have any skilled workers to make your money with . If there were no roads you would n't be able to ship your goods far enough to become as rich as you are . In the end , the rich will end up paying a smaller portion ( if not a smaller amount ) of their income in taxes because of tax loopholes ( ie , because the capital gains tax is a lower percentage than income tax , and much of their income is from investments ) and because they spend less of their income , meaning less of their income goes to sales taxes and excise taxes . This is why Monaco , despite having an 18 % tax rate , is considered a tax haven . The poor end up paying a vastly higher effective tax rate ( assuming they spend 60 % of their income , they would be paying 10.8 % in taxes ) than the rich ( who , assuming they spend 10 % of the income , would be paying 1.8 % in tax ) . I use the terms poor and rich very loosely , of course .",

    "question": "The logic behind raising taxes for the poor and cutting them for the rich ? Thanks for the answers ! It makes a lot more sense now . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "There is no inherent logic behind raising taxes for the poor and cutting them for the rich. Different governments and policy makers have different reasons for choosing to implement certain tax policies. Here are a few examples of reasons that might be given for raising taxes on the poor and cutting them for the rich: \n1. Some people argue that the rich should pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes because they can afford to pay more. This is sometimes referred to as a \"progressive\" tax system. \n2. Some governments may raise taxes on the poor in order to fund programs or services that benefit the poor, such as social welfare programs. \n3. Some governments may cut taxes for the rich in order to encourage economic growth and investment. The theory is that if the rich have more money to spend or invest, it will create jobs and stimulate the economy. \nIt's important to note that these are just a few examples, and there are many different factors that can influence a government's tax policies. Ultimately, the logic behind any given tax policy will depend on the specific goals and priorities of the government that is implementing it.",

    "answer": "PTSD, or post-traumatic stress disorder, is a mental health condition that can develop after a person experiences or witnesses a traumatic event. This can include a wide range of events, such as combat, natural disasters, car accidents, sexual assault, or other violent incidents. \nSoldiers who do not participate in combat can still be exposed to traumatic events while serving in the military. For example, they might witness other soldiers being injured or killed, or they might be involved in dangerous situations that could threaten their own lives. They might also experience other types of stress, such as being away from home, being in a high-pressure environment, or seeing or hearing about disturbing events. \nAll of these experiences can be traumatic, and they can lead to the development of PTSD in some people. It's important to remember that everyone responds differently to traumatic events, and not everyone who experiences trauma will develop PTSD. However, if someone is experiencing symptoms of PTSD, it's important to seek help from a mental health professional to get the support and treatment they need.",

    "answer": "When you roll down a car window slightly and drive down the road, the wind rushing past the window can create a loud, high-pitched sound. This is because the air moving past the window is vibrating the window, and the vibrations are creating sound waves that your ear can hear. \nImagine you have a piece of paper and you hold it up in front of your mouth and blow. The paper will vibrate back and forth, and you'll be able to hear the sound of the paper vibrating. It's the same principle with the car window. The wind blowing past the window is causing the window to vibrate, and the vibrations are creating a sound that you can hear. \nThe sound is usually more noticeable when the window is only open a little bit because there is less space for the air to move through, which makes the window vibrate more. When the window is open all the way, there is more space for the air to move through, so the window doesn't vibrate as much and the sound is not as loud.",

    "answer": "While it is possible for an individual to respect and appreciate the teachings and beliefs of multiple religions, it is generally not possible to fully adhere to the practices and beliefs of multiple religions at the same time. This is because many religions have specific beliefs and practices that are central to their faith and may conflict with the beliefs and practices of other religions. \nFor example, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity all have specific beliefs about the nature of God, the role of Jesus, and the way that individuals should live their lives. These beliefs may be incompatible with one another, making it difficult for an individual to fully embrace the teachings of all three religions simultaneously. \nAdditionally, many religions require their followers to make specific commitments, such as participating in certain rituals or following certain dietary laws, that may be incompatible with the practices of other religions. \nOverall, while it is possible to respect and appreciate the teachings of multiple religions, it can be difficult to fully embrace the practices and beliefs of multiple religions at the same time.",

    "answer": "Acne is a common skin condition that occurs when the hair follicles on your skin become clogged with oil and dead skin cells. The clogged pores can become infected with bacteria, and this can cause a pimple or zit to form. Pimples are also called zits, spots, or blemishes. \nPimples can form on any part of your body, but they are most common on the face, neck, chest, and back. They can range in size from very small to large and can be red, white, or black in color. Some pimples are painful, while others are not. \nThere are many different things that can cause pimples to form. Some common triggers include: \nHormonal changes: Pimples are common during puberty when the body's hormones are changing. Hormonal changes can also cause pimples to form in adults.\nGenetics: If your parents had acne, you are more likely to develop acne as well.\nDiet: Some people find that certain foods, such as chocolate or fried foods, can trigger pimples.\nSkin care products: Some skincare products can irritate the skin and cause pimples to form.\nStress: Stress can affect the body's hormone levels and can cause pimples to form. \nPimples can be treated with over-the-counter or prescription medications, such as creams or gels that contain benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. It is important to keep the skin clean and to avoid picking or squeezing pimples, as this can cause them to become infected or leave scars.",

    "answer": "A hedge fund is a type of investment fund that uses various strategies to earn a profit. These strategies may include buying and selling stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments, as well as using financial derivatives (contracts that derive their value from an underlying asset) and leverage (borrowing money to increase the potential return on an investment). \nHedge funds are often worth a lot of money because they can potentially earn high returns for their investors. However, they also carry a higher level of risk than some other types of investments, so it's important to carefully consider the potential risks and rewards before investing in a hedge fund. \nTo start a hedge fund, a person or group of people typically need to have a lot of knowledge and experience in finance and investing. They also need to have a solid business plan, a strategy for earning a profit, and the ability to attract investors who are willing to put their money into the fund.

    "answer": "Great question! When you see a number like \"64GB\" on a USB drive or other storage device, it refers to the amount of data that can be stored on the device.

On a console or computer, some of the space is used for the operating system and other programs that are needed to run the device. \nSo when you see a number like \"64GB\" on a storage device, it's an approximation of the amount of space you'll have available for your own files.

    "answer": "During the State of the Union address, the president gives a speech to a joint session of Congress, which includes members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The president speaks about the state of the country and proposes policies and initiatives for the coming year. It's customary for members of Congress to stand and applaud at certain points during the speech, such as when the president proposes a policy that they support or when they want to show their respect for the president. \nHowever, not all members of Congress agree with everything that the president says or proposes. Some members may disagree with the president's policies or disagree with the way he is running the country. These members may choose not to stand and applaud during the speech to show their disagreement or to signal that they are not in support of the president's policies. This is a way for them to express their political views and to show that they are not in complete agreement with the president. \nSo, the section of the audience that never stands up or applauds during the State of the Union address is made up of members of Congress who do not agree with the president's policies or who do not want to show support for him. They are exercising their right to express their political views and to show that they are not in complete agreement with the president.",

    "answer": "The letter \"U\" and the letter \"V\" were originally used interchangeably in the Latin alphabet and were both used to represent the same sound, which is similar to the sound of the English letter \"w\". In fact, the letter \"U\" was originally just a variant of the letter \"V\" that was used at the beginning of a word. \nOver time, the two letters developed slightly different shapes, with \"U\" becoming more rounded and \"V\" becoming more pointed. However, the distinction between the two letters was not always consistent, and it was not until the Middle Ages that the modern shapes of the letters \"U\" and \"V\" became standardized. \nIn some older texts and inscriptions, you may still see the letter \"U\" being used in place of the letter \"V\" or vice versa. This is because the distinction between the two letters was not always consistently applied in the past, and the use of the letters varied depending on the time period and the language being written. \nSo, in the case of the American Museum of Natural History, it is likely that the use of the letter \"V\" in place of the letter \"U\" is simply a reflection of the conventions that were used when the building was constructed. The carvers may have used the letter \"V\" because that is how it was traditionally written, or because it was easier to carve the pointed shape of the letter \"V\" into stone.",

    "answer": "A hydrophobic treatment is a special coating that is applied to the surface of a ship to make it more water-resistant. This means that water will bead up and roll off the surface of the ship instead of sticking to it and soaking in. \nOne effect of using a hydrophobic treatment on a ship is that it can help to reduce drag and improve the ship's performance in the water. This is because water will not stick to the surface of the ship and create resistance, which can slow the ship down. \nThere are a few reasons why a ship might not use a hydrophobic treatment. One reason is cost: applying a hydrophobic treatment can be expensive, especially if the ship is very large. Another reason is that the treatment may wear off over time, so it would need to be reapplied regularly to maintain its effectiveness. Finally, some hydrophobic treatments may have negative effects on the environment, so they may not be allowed in certain areas.",

Without oil, it would be difficult for us to do many of the things we do every day. \nHowever, oil can also have negative effects on the Earth.

    "answer": "Correlation refers to a relationship between two things, where one thing (called a \"variable\") might have an effect on the other. For example, if you eat more ice cream, you might get more cavities. In this case, there is a correlation between eating ice cream and getting cavities, because one thing (eating ice cream) seems to be related to the other (getting cavities). \nCausation refers to a relationship where one thing (the cause) directly causes another thing (the effect). In the example of eating ice cream and getting cavities, the causation would be that eating ice cream directly causes you to get cavities. \nHowever, just because two things are correlated does not mean that one thing is causing the other. There might be other factors that are causing both things to happen. For example, if you eat more ice cream and also brush your teeth less often, you might get more cavities. In this case, the lack of tooth brushing is causing the cavities, not the ice cream. \nSo, to sum up: correlation means that two things seem to be related, but causation means that one thing directly causes the other.

The human mouth is designed to be able to chew and swallow food with either side of the mouth. The muscles in the mouth and the teeth are symmetrical, so it is possible to chew and swallow food with either side of the mouth. \nIt is important to remember to chew your food well, no matter which side of the mouth you use.

    "question": "Why is there more information about the stars and the universe , but little information about earths oceans ? Seriously , I 'm interested in deep sea exploration and there is hardly anything about it , instead we know more about stars 500 million lightyears away . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "There is actually a lot of information available about the oceans and deep sea exploration, it's just that the oceans are much harder to study and explore than outer space. The oceans cover about 70% of the Earth's surface and are much deeper than the highest mountains, so they are much harder to get to and study. In addition, the water in the oceans is very cold, dark, and pressure is very high at greater depths, which makes it difficult for humans and instruments to survive and work. \nOn the other hand, outer space is much easier to study because we can send telescopes and other instruments up into orbit or even beyond our own solar system to study the stars and other celestial objects. These instruments can take pictures and make measurements of these objects and send the information back to Earth, where scientists can study it. \nSo while there is still a lot that we don't know about the oceans and deep sea exploration, scientists and researchers are constantly working to learn more and improve our understanding of these mysterious and fascinating environments.",

    "question": "Why , in virtually every picture of the Earth taken from space , is North shown as being at the top of the picture ? Surely in space such dimensions are meaningless , so how come all the photos look like such ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "When people look at a map of the Earth, they usually expect to see it in a certain way, with north at the top and south at the bottom. This is because we are used to seeing maps this way and it helps us orient ourselves and understand where different places are in relation to each other. When a picture of the Earth is taken from space, it is often shown with north at the top because that is what people are used to seeing and it helps them understand the photo. It is also easier to label the different parts of the Earth when it is shown this way. However, it is important to remember that in space, there is no \"up\" or \"down\" in the same way that there is on Earth. The direction that is \"up\" in a photo of the Earth taken from space is really just a matter of perspective and has no real meaning in the broader context of the universe.",

    "question": "Freud 's Theory of Penis Envy . My friend suggested I check this out and it 's really hurting my head . Thank you thank you ! Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Copy - pasted from Wikipedia : Soon after the libidinal shift to the penis , the child develops her first sexual impulses towards her mother . The girl realizes that she is not physically equipped to have a heterosexual relationship with her mother , since she does not have a penis . She desires a penis , and the power that it represents . This is described as penis envy . She sees the solution as obtaining her father 's penis . She develops a sexual desire for her father . The girl blames her mother for her apparent castration ( what she sees as punishment by the mother for being attracted to the father ) assisting a shift in the focus of her sexual impulses from her mother to her father . Sexual desire for her father leads to the desire to replace and eliminate her mother . The girl identifies with her mother so that she might learn to mimic her , and thus replace her . The child anticipates that both aforementioned desires will incur punishment ( by the principle of lex talionis ) . The girl employs the defence mechanism of displacement to shift the object of her sexual desires from her father to men in general . TL;DR Freud did n't understand women . At all .",

    "answer": "Sigmund Freud was a psychologist who developed many theories about the human mind and behavior. One of his theories was about how girls develop during childhood. According to Freud, girls go through a stage called \"penis envy\" during which they feel jealous of boys because boys have a penis and girls do not. \nFreud believed that this feeling of jealousy was a normal part of a girl's development and that it was caused by the realization that girls do not have the same physical anatomy as boys. He thought that this feeling of envy could lead to feelings of inadequacy and a desire to be more like boys. \nHowever, Freud's theory of penis envy has been widely criticized and is not widely accepted by modern psychologists. Many people believe that it is not accurate or fair to say that girls feel jealous of boys simply because they have a different anatomy. \nIt's important to keep in mind that Freud's theories are just one way of understanding human development and behavior, and that there are many other theories that have been developed since his time.",

    "answer": "In the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that all public buildings, including prisons, be wheelchair accessible. This means that prisons must have ramps, elevators, and other accommodations to make it easier for people in wheelchairs to move around the facility. \nIf someone in a wheelchair is sentenced to prison, they will be placed in a unit or cell that is accessible to them. This may include having a wheelchair-accessible shower, toilet, and bed. The prison may also have staff members who are trained to assist people with disabilities, including those who use wheelchairs. \nIt is important to note that every prison is different, and some may have more or less accessibility than others. However, overall, the goal is to ensure that people with disabilities, including those who use wheelchairs, are able to access the same services and opportunities as everyone else while they are in prison.",

    "answer": "Genetic makeup can make a person more or less susceptible to cancer. Some people may have a higher risk of developing certain types of cancer due to inherited genetic mutations, while others may have a lower risk. However, it is important to note that no one is completely immune to cancer. \nThere are several ways in which a person's genes can influence their risk of developing cancer. For example, some people may have inherited mutations in certain genes that increase their risk of developing certain types of cancer. For example, people with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation have a higher risk of developing breast, ovarian, and other types of cancer. \nIn addition to inherited genetic mutations, certain lifestyle factors can also increase a person's risk of developing cancer. These may include things like smoking, unhealthy diet, and lack of physical activity. It is important for everyone to take steps to reduce their risk of cancer by making healthy lifestyle choices and getting regular check-ups and screenings.",

[ Like this ] ( URL_1 ) instead of something like [ this ] ( URL_2 ) . If so , we have an easy answer . It 's called a [ snorkeling mask ] ( URL_0 ) . ;) ( completely tongue in cheek , this does n't actually do what you want ) . The real reason is because the oxygen concentration ( partial pressure ) in the water is much lower than the partial pressure of oxygen in the air . Therefore , it 's very difficult to concentrate it to levels that humans can safely breathe ( we need a lot more oxygen than fish do , just because we 're air adapted not water adapted ) . Getting any solute from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration is difficult . It can be done with something that binds oxygen very tightly , but then how to release the oxygen so it can be breathed in ? Also , getting the total pressure of the air correct so that it can be breathed properly would be difficult . There is even less nitrogen in the water than oxygen . Therefore , even if you could get enough oxygen it would be less than one atmosphere , maybe even less than one fifth of one atmosphere , in pressure , so it would be very difficult to breathe .",

    "answer": "It is actually quite difficult to replicate the organ that allows fish to breathe underwater because it is a complex system that involves many different parts working together. The organ that allows fish to breathe underwater is called the gills, and it is located on the side of the fish's head. The gills are made up of thin, delicate tissue that is filled with tiny blood vessels. When water passes over the gills, the thin tissue and blood vessels allow oxygen from the water to be absorbed into the fish's bloodstream. \nCreating a device that can simulate this process and provide oxygen from water would require a lot of technological advancements and a thorough understanding of how the fish's gills work. Scientists and engineers are constantly working on ways to develop new technologies and devices that can help humans breathe underwater, but it is a challenging task. For example, some researchers are developing special masks that use a process called \"rebreathing\" to recycle the air that a person exhales and convert it into oxygen that can be used again. These types of devices are still in the early stages of development and are not yet widely available.",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why servers can often have longer uptimes than desktop computers: \n1. Hardware: servers are often built with higher-quality components and are designed to run continuously for long periods of time. They may also have features like redundant power supplies and hard drives to help ensure they stay up and running even if one component fails. \n2. Software: server operating systems are usually designed to be more stable and reliable than desktop operating systems. They may have features like automatic crash recovery and support for hot-swapping hardware, which can help prevent downtime. \n3. Usage: servers are often used for specific tasks, such as hosting websites or running databases, which means they are not being used for resource-intensive activities like gaming or video editing. This can help them run more reliably for longer periods of time. \n4. Maintenance: servers are often monitored and maintained more closely than desktop computers, which can help prevent issues from arising and ensure that they are running smoothly. \nIn general, servers are built to be more reliable and have longer uptimes than desktop computers because they are often used in critical applications where downtime can be costly.",

    "answer": "There are several ways that planes can be prevented from impersonating other airplanes and entering a country's airspace without proper authorization. Here are a few examples: \n1. Radar: Most countries have radar systems that can detect and track aircraft that are flying within their airspace. These systems can help identify the type of aircraft, its altitude, and its intended flight path. If an aircraft is behaving suspiciously or is not following the proper flight procedures, it can be detected and investigated. \n2. Air traffic control: Air traffic controllers are responsible for managing the flow of aircraft within a country's airspace. They communicate with pilots and provide them with instructions on where to fly and how to safely navigate around other aircraft. If an aircraft does not respond to their communications or appears to be behaving suspiciously, air traffic controllers can alert the appropriate authorities. \n3. Military aircraft: Many countries also have military aircraft that are specifically designed to patrol their airspace and protect against unauthorized intrusions. These aircraft can intercept and investigate any aircraft that appears to be behaving suspiciously. \n4. International agreements: There are also international agreements in place that outline the rules for aircraft entering another country's airspace. For example, if an aircraft wants to enter another country's airspace, it must first request permission and provide information about its intended flight path and the type of aircraft it is. If the request is not granted, the aircraft is not allowed to enter the airspace. \nOverall, there are many measures in place to prevent planes from impersonating other airplanes and entering a country's airspace without proper authorization.",

However, it's true that some Republicans do reject certain scientific concepts or findings, such as evolution and climate change. \nOne reason why some people, including some Republicans, might reject certain scientific concepts is that they may have religious or ideological beliefs that conflict with the scientific evidence. For example, some people might believe that the Earth is only a few thousand years old, which conflicts with the scientific evidence that the Earth is billions of years old. Similarly, some people might believe that humans have a special place in the universe and are not subject to the same natural laws that apply to other living things, which conflicts with the scientific evidence for evolution. \nAnother reason why some people, including some Republicans, might reject certain scientific concepts is that they may be skeptical of the scientific method and the ways in which scientists arrive at their conclusions. Some people might believe that scientists are biased or that the scientific process is flawed in some way, and therefore they might be more likely to reject scientific findings that they disagree with. \nIt's also worth noting that some people, including some Republicans, might reject certain scientific concepts because they are misinformed about them or because they have been exposed to misinformation about them. For example, some people might believe that climate change is not real because they have heard false or misleading information about it. \nIn short, there are many different reasons why some people, including some Republicans, might reject certain scientific concepts.

Wear a scarf or other face covering over your mouth and nose when you go jogging in cold weather. This will help warm the air before you breathe it in. \n2. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water before and after your jog. This will help keep your throat moist, which can reduce irritation. \n3. Try to breathe through your nose instead of your mouth. Your nose has tiny hairs called cilia that help filter out irritants, so breathing through your nose can help protect your throat. \n4. Take breaks to warm up and drink something warm, like tea or broth. This can help soothe your throat and keep it from getting too dry or irritated. \n5.

    "answer": "Diplomatic immunity is a legal principle that gives certain foreign government officials immunity from prosecution in the host country where they are serving. This immunity applies to both civil and criminal cases. It is intended to allow diplomats to do their job without fear of legal repercussions in the host country. \nHowever, diplomatic immunity is not a \"get out of jail free\" card. It does not give diplomats the right to break the law or commit crimes with impunity. If a diplomat commits a serious crime, such as murder, the host country has the right to waive the diplomat's immunity and allow them to be prosecuted. \nIn general, the country where the diplomat is from is responsible for disciplining or punishing the diplomat if they have committed a crime. The host country can request that the diplomat be recalled to their home country to face charges, but the home country is not required to do so. \nIn summary, diplomatic immunity is a legal principle that gives certain foreign government officials immunity from prosecution in the host country where they are serving, but it does not cover all crimes and can be waived if a diplomat commits a serious crime.",

    "answer": "The extra body hair in the armpits and pubic region serves a few different purposes. \nIn the armpits, the hair helps to regulate body temperature by trapping a layer of air close to the skin. This trapped air helps to insulate the body and prevent heat loss. The armpits are also a common place for sweat glands, which produce a salty liquid called sweat. The hair in the armpits helps to keep the sweat close to the skin, where it can evaporate and help to cool the body down. \nThe hair in the pubic region serves a similar purpose, in that it helps to regulate body temperature by trapping a layer of air close to the skin. In addition, the hair in the pubic region helps to protect the sensitive skin in that area from rubbing and irritation, especially during physical activities such as running or biking. \nIn both the armpits and pubic region, the hair also serves to protect the skin from bacteria and other germs that may cause infections. The hair in these areas can help to trap dirt and bacteria before it comes into contact with the skin. \nIt's important to note that everyone's bodies are different, and some people may have more or less body hair in these areas than others.

    "answer": "The speed of light is a very special speed that nothing in the universe can surpass. This is because the faster something goes, the more energy it takes to keep it moving. Eventually, the amount of energy needed to keep an object moving becomes so great that it would take an infinite amount of energy to keep the object moving at the speed of light. \nImagine you are pushing a sled across the snow. The faster you want the sled to go, the harder you have to push. Now imagine that you are pushing the sled as hard as you possibly can, but it still isn't going as fast as you want it to. That's because there are other factors that are holding the sled back, like friction between the sled and the snow. \nNow imagine that you are trying to push a sled across the snow at the speed of light. It would take an infinite amount of energy to push the sled that fast because all of the forces that are holding the sled back would become infinite as well. \nSo, in short, we will never be able to travel at the speed of light because it would take an infinite amount of energy to do so.",

    "question": "Why are some circuits just positive / negative while others have a ground ? What makes these different and why is a ground needed ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "In an electrical circuit, positive and negative charges flow through wires to power devices like lights or appliances. The positive charge flows through the circuit to the negative charge, creating an electrical current. \nSometimes, circuits are set up with just a positive and negative wire, and these are called \"floating\" circuits. These types of circuits can be used in simple devices like a flashlight, where the positive and negative charges flow through the circuit and back again, turning on the light. \nHowever, in many cases, it is important to have a third wire in the circuit, called a \"ground\" wire. This ground wire provides a safe path for the electrical current to flow to the ground, or Earth, if there is a problem with the circuit. \nFor example, if a device has a short circuit or malfunction, the excess electricity may try to flow through the device and could potentially cause a fire or injury. By having a ground wire, the excess electricity can flow safely to the ground instead of flowing through the device or a person. \nGround wires are often used in circuits that have higher voltages, like those found in buildings or homes, because the risk of injury or damage is greater in these types of circuits. However, ground wires can also be used in smaller circuits to provide an additional layer of safety.",

    "answer": "In the United States, the government does not require everyone to have health insurance. However, the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare) did require most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty when they filed their taxes. The purpose of this requirement was to encourage people to get health insurance, so that they would be covered if they got sick or needed medical care. \nThe government does not require people to buy health insurance because it believes that having insurance is a personal responsibility. It is up to each individual to decide whether they want to purchase insurance or not. \nThere are several reasons why the government does not require everyone to have health insurance and instead relies on a system of private insurance companies to provide coverage. One reason is that private insurance companies can offer a wide range of insurance plans to meet the needs of different people. For example, some insurance plans cover more services than others, and some are more affordable than others. \nAnother reason is that the government believes that competition among private insurance companies can help keep prices down. When there are many insurance companies competing for customers, they may offer lower prices or better coverage in order to attract more business. \nFinally, the government does not require everyone to have health insurance because it is expensive to provide healthcare to everyone. Instead, the government provides financial assistance to help people who cannot afford to purchase insurance on their own. This assistance can come in the form of subsidies, which are discounts on the cost of insurance, or Medicaid, which is a program that provides free or low-cost healthcare to low-income individuals and families.",

    "question": "Who profits from the current Ukraine crisis ? Clearly the NATO and Russia are both losing in this current crisis . This raises the question of who is profiting from it ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "This is a complicated question , and the simple version is no one is profiting now , the profits will only come when the crisis is over . Profits though would n't be monetary but strategic . NATO would gain a country with a direct border with Russia and increase their bufferzone between Russia and the west , while Russia wants to maintain it 's soviet buffer with Europe . For Russia it 's also a matter of prestige to keep allies from the Old Soviet block . Now , there is a theory that was presented by an ex - Putin cabinet member which says Putin is trying to destroy the east via this conflict as a way to start talks with Ukraine in which they 'd agree to receive aid from Russia to rebuild the east in exchange for their loyalty and staying out of the EU and NATO . Thus keeping them as allies . That 's if we only count countries in the scenario . If we count private entities then obviously whenever you have two sides selling weapons to both camps then the weapons companies are the ones who profit . EDIT : Also I 'm not sure why you 're saying ' NATO and Russia are clearly losing ' . This is a chess game and the only real loser is Ukraine which is taking the blunt of the conflict .",

    "question": "How is it that commercial airline crashes are so rare ? You would think that with the many thousands of flights that move all around the world everyday , mechanical issues or pilot issues would happen more often than they do . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Think about all of the things that cause car accidents . * Other drivers / cars * Mechanical issues * Driver mistakes ( including alcohol / drugs ) Let 's see how airlines tackle these : * There are n't many other planes in the sky , and whenever they 're close to each other ( near an airport ) there 's a team of people tightly organizing where they go and when . * Each plane is fully serviced by mechanics after every single flight , and parts are repaired , fluids are replaced , etc . I take fairly good care of my car , and I 'm not visiting my mechanic more than once every 2 - 3 months . Many people are much less careful than me . Imagine if all of us were getting our cars serviced a few times daily ! On top of that , keep in mind that there are only a few commercial jet manufacturers in the world , and these people sell their products for millions .

    "answer": "Commercial airline crashes are actually quite rare, despite the fact that there are many thousands of flights all around the world every day. There are several reasons for this: \n1. Airplanes are built to be very safe. They are designed to withstand a lot of wear and tear, and they have multiple systems in place to ensure that they stay in the air and don't have any problems. \n2. Pilots are highly trained. Pilots go through a lot of training before they are allowed to fly a commercial airplane. They learn how to handle all sorts of different situations, and they are prepared to deal with emergencies if they arise. \n3. There are strict safety regulations in place. Governments and other organizations have strict rules in place to make sure that airplanes are as safe as possible. These rules cover everything from how the planes are built to how they are maintained and operated. \n4. Airplanes are maintained regularly. Airplanes go through regular inspections and maintenance to make sure that they are in good working order. If there are any problems, they are fixed before the plane is allowed to fly again. \nOverall, these measures help to make commercial airline travel one of the safest forms of transportation.",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why Blizzard takes its servers offline for maintenance on a regular basis. \nFirst, it is important for game developers to perform maintenance on their servers in order to fix bugs and make updates to the game. This helps ensure that the game is running smoothly and players are having a good experience. \nSecond, game servers, like any other type of computer server, can become overloaded or encounter issues that require them to be shut down in order to be fixed. This is especially true for games that have a large player base, as there may be more people trying to access the server at the same time. \nFinally, game developers often schedule maintenance at times when there are fewer players online, in order to minimize the impact on the player community. This is likely the case with Blizzard, which has chosen to perform maintenance on Tuesdays when there may be fewer players online. \nIn contrast, other game services, such as PSN and XBL, may not need to perform maintenance as frequently, or they may have more resources available to them to keep the servers running without interruption.",

    "answer": "Marriage is a legally recognized relationship between two people that brings with it certain rights and responsibilities. These rights and responsibilities can include things like how property is shared, how financial assets are managed, and how decisions are made about the care and upbringing of children. \nThe government recognizes marriages because it has an interest in promoting stable relationships and supporting families. By providing legal recognition to marriages, the government can help to ensure that couples have access to certain rights and protections that can help to strengthen their relationship and provide a more stable environment for any children they might have. \nIf the government stopped recognizing marriages, it would be much more difficult for couples to access these rights and protections. For example, if a couple were not legally married, they might not have the same rights to make medical decisions for each other in an emergency, or to inherit from each other if one of them dies. \nOverall, the legal recognition of marriage helps to support strong and stable relationships, which can be good for individuals, families, and society as a whole.",

    "answer": "Plants do not have the same physical structures and biological processes as animals, so they do not experience obesity in the same way. Unlike animals, plants do not have organs such as muscles and a digestive system that need energy to function. Instead, plants use the energy they produce to grow, produce flowers and fruit, and perform other functions necessary for their survival. \nPlants store excess energy in the form of sugars and other compounds in their leaves, stems, roots, and other parts of the plant. This energy can be used when the plant needs it, such as during times when there is not enough sunlight or water for the plant to photosynthesize. \nSo, while plants do store excess energy, they do not experience obesity because they do not have the same physical structures and processes as animals. They use their excess energy to support their growth and other essential functions, rather than storing it in the same way that animals do.",

    "answer": "IIRC , the Baha'i faith holds that there is one true God , and that every \" prophet \" or founder of major world religions was a messenger of God providing an incomplete message , but one that would be understood by the people of that time . Krishna , the Buddha , Abraham , Jesus , and Muhammad were all revealing the True word of God , but God intentionally left the message incomplete . Sayyid Ali - Muhammad claimed that he knew the Mahdi was coming , and that he would be able to identify the Mahdi . The Mahdi is a messianic figure in twelve Shi'ite Islam who will bring a new age in which the world will be in union with the law of God .

    "answer": "Winter and Summer are n't caused by the earth moving towards and away from the sun . Earth 's orbit is elliptical , like all orbits , but it is n't eccentric enough to cause that kind of variation . The season 's are caused by Earth 's axial tilt , which is around 23 degrees . When the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun between June and September , it is exposed to more direct solar radiation and temperatures rise . From December to March , the northern hemisphere tilts away from the sun and temperatures fall . Since the southern hemisphere is on the opposite side of the earth , it experiences summer when the north experiences winter and vice - versa .",

    "answer": "Sure! The Earth's orbit around the sun is not a perfect circle, but rather an ellipse, or a slightly oval-shaped circle. This means that the Earth is slightly closer to the sun at certain times of the year and slightly farther away at other times. When the Earth is closest to the sun, it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere (where it is currently winter) and summer in the Southern Hemisphere. When the Earth is farther away from the sun, it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere. \nThe reason for this has to do with the tilt of the Earth's axis. The Earth's axis is an imaginary line that goes through the North and South Poles and around which the Earth rotates. The Earth's axis is tilted about 23.5 degrees relative to the plane of its orbit around the sun. This means that different parts of the Earth receive different amounts of sunlight throughout the year. \nDuring the winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole is tilted away from the sun, so the Northern Hemisphere receives less direct sunlight. This is why it is colder in the winter. During the summer in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole is tilted towards the sun, so the Northern Hemisphere receives more direct sunlight. This is why it is warmer in the summer. \nAs for the question about electromagnetic waves losing energy as they travel, electromagnetic waves do not lose energy as they travel through empty space. However, they can be absorbed or scattered by objects that they encounter, which can affect their intensity (how bright or strong they are). This is why the sun appears to be less bright in the winter than in the summer, even though it is actually the same distance away from the Earth.",

In the case of a UN resolution against North Korea, Russia and China might decide to veto it for a variety of reasons. \nOne reason might be that they have strong political and economic ties with North Korea. Both countries have historically had close relationships with North Korea, and they may see the country as a valuable partner in certain areas. By vetoing a UN resolution against North Korea, they might be trying to protect their own interests and maintain a good relationship with the country. \nAnother reason might be that they disagree with the specific actions proposed in the resolution. Even if they believe that North Korea's actions are problematic, they might not agree with the specific measures that are being proposed to address the issue. \nIt's also possible that they might have concerns about the broader implications of the resolution.

    "question": "Why do alcoholic drinks dehydrate you ? Why you get such bad hangovers due to dehydration from , beer , for example ? Surely the beer has water in it that contributes , like just plain water , to your bodies hydration levels ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "First , the body pays special attention to alcohol . It 's a small molecule and gets very quickly through the walls of the gut into the bloodstream and then to the brain . Second , if you weigh 60 kilograms , you generate about 60 milliliters of urine each hour . And for 80 kilograms , about 80 milliliters per hour , and so on . Third , we humans seem to prefer to drink our alcohol in 10 gram lumps . Ten grams of alcohol is about 12.5 milliliters ( but you can call it 10 mL and still be fairly accurate ) . So each glass of beer , wine , or spirits has about 10 grams of alcohol . Fourth , alcohol interferes with the mechanism that regulates the water levels in our body . So now , a little anatomy and physiology . In your brain is a small gland called the pituitary gland . It is divided into two sections : the front ; and the back . The back section is called the posterior pituitary . One of the hormones made by the posterior pituitary gland is called vasopressin , or anti - diuretic hormone ( ADH ) . Diuresis is a fancy word meaning urination . Now suppose that you are really dehydrated . So the volume of water in your body is low . But you still have just as many salts floating in this reduced volume of water . So these salts are now more concentrated in the reduced volume of water that you have when you are dehydrated . Your body has detectors that can sense both the saltiness of your water , and the volume of the water . If these detectors reckon that you are dehydrated , they send a signal to the posterior pituitary gland , which starts pumping out ADH . The job of ADH is to stop you urinating , so you hang on to your precious water . You reduce your normal rate of making urine . Alcohol does the opposite . It reduces how much ADH you make , so it increases how much urine you produce . Each shot of alcohol that you drink forces your kidneys to generate an extra 120 milliliters of urine on top of the normal 60\u201380 milliliters per hour .",

    "answer": "Alcoholic drinks can dehydrate you because they can increase the amount of urine your body produces. When you drink alcohol, your body is more likely to need to urinate, which can lead to a loss of fluids. Additionally, alcohol can interfere with the hormone that helps to regulate your body's hydration levels, which can contribute to dehydration. \nWhile it is true that beer does contain some water, it is also high in alcohol, which can contribute to dehydration. This is why it is important to drink plenty of water along with alcohol to help stay hydrated. \nHangovers can be caused by a number of factors, including dehydration, but they can also be caused by other factors such as inflammation, changes in brain chemistry, and the presence of toxins in the body. Dehydration can contribute to a hangover because it can cause symptoms like thirst, fatigue, and headache. \nTo help prevent hangovers and the dehydration that can come with them, it is a good idea to drink plenty of water while you are drinking alcohol, and to continue to drink water after you are finished drinking. It is also a good idea to pace yourself when you are drinking and to try to avoid drinking too much in a short period of time.",

    "answer": "When a candle burns, it produces a small amount of smoke. This smoke is made up of tiny particles of unburned wax and other substances that are released into the air as the candle burns. \nHowever, when you blow out a candle, you are extinguishing the flame by cutting off the oxygen supply. This can cause the candle to smoke more heavily because the wax is still hot and the flame is still burning, but it is not getting enough oxygen to continue burning cleanly. The smoke you see when you blow out a candle is made up of these unburned particles of wax and other substances that are released into the air. \nOverall, the amount of smoke that a candle produces depends on how efficiently the candle is burning. A candle that is burning cleanly and efficiently will produce less smoke than a candle that is not burning as well.",

The substances that can trigger an allergic reaction are called allergens. In some people, the immune system mistakes these allergens as harmful and mounts an excessive response to them. This can cause symptoms like sneezing, itchy eyes, and difficulty breathing. \nGenetics play a role in whether or not a person develops allergies. If a person has a family history of allergies, they are more likely to develop allergies themselves. However, genetics are not the only factor. Environmental factors, such as exposure to allergens and other substances, can also affect the development of allergies. \nNatural selection is the process by which certain traits become more or less common in a population over time. The traits that are most beneficial to survival and reproduction are more likely to be passed on to future generations. If a trait is harmful or disadvantageous, it is less likely to be passed on. \nIn theory, if a trait like allergies was consistently harmful and caused people to have a lower chance of surviving and reproducing, it could eventually be phased out through natural selection. However, this process can take a long time and is not guaranteed. \nThere is also the possibility that allergies could be beneficial to some people in certain situations. For example, allergies to certain substances could help protect against certain diseases or parasites. In these cases, the trait might not be selected against, and could even be passed on to future generations. \nSo, to answer your question, it is possible that allergies could eventually be phased out through natural selection, but it is not a simple process and is influenced by many factors.",

There are only two things stopping you from finding an island and starting the People 's Democratic Free Opensource Republic of Doge : ( 1 ) finding an unclaimed island or ( 2 ) convincing a country to relinquish its claim on an island / convincing other countries to recognize your claim as superior to the existing country 's claim .

    "answer": "Starting your own nation is not as simple as finding an island and declaring it to be a country. In order for a nation to be recognized as a country, it generally must meet certain criteria, such as having a defined territory, a permanent population, a functioning government, and the ability to enter into relationships with other countries. \nIn order to be recognized as a country by the international community, a nation must also be recognized by other countries. This typically involves other countries formally acknowledging the existence of the new nation and establishing diplomatic relations with it. \nIt is also important to note that many islands are already claimed by other countries, and it may not be legal or possible to simply declare an island to be a new nation. Additionally, starting a new nation would likely require a significant amount of resources and logistical planning, as well as potentially facing challenges such as obtaining international recognition and establishing a functioning government.",

    "question": "The latest Supreme Court case against the ACA , or Obamacare I read through [ this article ] ( URL_0 ) but I 'm still sort of lost as to what is being challenged here . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, is a law that was passed in 2010 that made significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. One of the main goals of the ACA was to make health insurance more accessible and affordable for people who didn't have it. The ACA did this by requiring most Americans to have health insurance, providing subsidies to help people pay for insurance, and requiring insurance companies to offer coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions. \nRecently, a group of states challenged the ACA in a case that went all the way to the Supreme Court. The states argued that the ACA was unconstitutional because Congress had passed a law in 2017 that eliminated a tax that was used to help fund the ACA. Without this tax, the states argued, the ACA was no longer constitutional. \nThe Supreme Court heard arguments in the case in November 2021, and a decision is expected sometime in 2022. If the Court decides that the ACA is unconstitutional, it could have significant consequences for the millions of people who have gained health insurance through the ACA and for the U.S. healthcare system as a whole.",

For example, if you turn a pencil so that it is pointing straight up, that is 0 degrees. If you turn the pencil to the right until it is pointing straight out to the side, that is 90 degrees. If you turn it all the way around in a circle, that is 360 degrees. \nDegrees are a convenient way to measure both temperature and angles because they allow us to describe how much something has changed or turned using a standard unit.",

    "answer": "[ This gif will help . ] ( URL_0 ) Lighting . Lighting can change how a person looks . In normal day - to - day life , light sources , whether they be from the Sun or lightbulbs , are usually above you . When the light is here , the shadows appear in locations the brain is used to . Everything looks normal . But in a camera picture , the light is coming from the camera .

The loss of shadows means a loss of details , which makes an uglier picture .

    "question": "Why do I look so ugly when I take a picture of myself , but look good on the mirror ? Also some friends look weird in photos but look much better in person , and others just look like the same . Why ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "There are a few reasons why you might look different in a photo than you do in the mirror. One reason is that cameras and mirrors show us slightly different perspectives of our faces. When you look in a mirror, you see a reflection of yourself that is facing you, so you see both sides of your face at once. In a photo, the camera is usually further away from your face, so it captures a wider view of your face, including your profile. This can sometimes make your nose or other features look bigger or more prominent in a photo than they do in the mirror. \nAnother reason you might look different in a photo is because of the lighting. If the lighting in the room is different from the lighting in the photo, it can change the way your face looks. For example, if you take a photo in bright sunlight, it can create shadows on your face that aren't there when you look in the mirror. Similarly, if you take a photo with a flash, it can wash out your skin tone and make you look pale or shiny. \nFinally, it's also possible that you just see yourself differently in the mirror than you do in photos. Sometimes our brains can play tricks on us and we don't see ourselves as accurately as other people do. So even if you look the same in a photo as you do in the mirror, you might still feel like you look different. \nAs for why some people look different in photos than they do in person, it could be because of any of the reasons I mentioned above, or it could be because of other factors, like the angle of the camera or the expression on their face. It's also possible that you just perceive them differently in person than you do in photos.",

    "answer": "Sure! When you turn on your WiFi, your phone is able to connect to nearby WiFi networks. These networks can be used to help determine your location. \nYour phone uses something called \"triangulation\" to figure out where you are. Triangulation is a way to find out where you are by measuring the distance between you and a few other things. In this case, the \"other things\" are WiFi networks. \nWhen your phone connects to a WiFi network, it can figure out how far away it is from that network. It does this by measuring how strong the signal is. The stronger the signal, the closer the WiFi network is. The weaker the signal, the farther away the WiFi network is. \nYour phone can connect to multiple WiFi networks at the same time. By measuring the strength of the signals from all of these networks, it can triangulate its position and figure out exactly where it is. This is much more accurate than just using the cellular network, which can only give a rough estimate of your location. \nSo, when an app asks you to turn on your WiFi, it's because it needs to use these nearby WiFi networks to help determine your location more accurately.",

Coupons are like special discounts or deals that you can use to buy things for less money. \nHere's how it works: \n1. First, you need to find coupons. You can find coupons in the newspaper, online, or in store flyers. You can also get coupons by signing up for newsletters or loyalty programs. \n2. Next, you need to plan your shopping trip. Look at the coupons you have and decide what you want to buy. You can use the coupons to save money on the things you need. \n3. When you go shopping, you can use the coupons at the checkout. Just show the coupon to the cashier and they will scan it. The discount will be taken off the total cost of your purchase. \n4. Some people like to combine coupons with special deals or sales at the store. For example, if the store is having a sale on cereal and you have a coupon for cereal, you can use both the sale and the coupon to get an even bigger discount. \n5. Finally, you can use the money you save with coupons to buy other things you need or want. \nBy using coupons and combining them with sales, people can save a lot of money on their shopping trips.

    "answer": "Store-bought orange juice is made from freshly squeezed oranges, but the process of making it and packaging it for sale changes the way it looks and tastes. \nFirst, the oranges are squeezed to extract the juice. Then, the juice is pasteurized, which means it is heated to a high temperature to kill any bacteria or germs that might be in it. This helps to make the juice last longer and reduces the risk of food poisoning. \nAfter pasteurization, the orange juice is often stored in large tanks for a period of time before it is bottled or packaged for sale. This storage process can change the taste of the orange juice, as the flavors may become less vibrant and the juice may become less fresh-tasting. \nAdditionally, some store-bought orange juice is made from a blend of juices from different types of oranges, which can also change the taste. Some brands also add extra ingredients, like sweeteners or flavorings, which can alter the taste and appearance of the orange juice. \nOverall, the process of making and packaging store-bought orange juice can cause it to taste and look different than freshly squeezed orange juice.",

This can make the music sound more balanced and enjoyable to listen to. \nIt's also important to note that everyone has their own personal preferences when it comes to how they like their music to sound. Some people may prefer a bass-heavy sound, while others may prefer a more balanced or treble-heavy sound. Using a preset EQ can allow you to tailor the sound of the music to your personal preferences. \nSo, while the music may have been mixed to sound the best it can in a studio, using a preset EQ can help to further adjust the balance of the frequencies to better suit your particular playback system and personal preferences.",

    "question": "if black friday is all positive revenue why do n't they do deals and stuff more often than once a year ? If ' being in the black ' is profit for companies , why do they limit their deals to one day of the year ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Deals and discounts are usually done for two reasons . 1 . To get rid of any long standing inventory to free - up room for new orders 2 . In anticipation of high volumes of demand ( surge in amount of customers ) When demand is expected to be extremely high , companies can afford to mark down items and offer sales , the minimal loss in revenue from marking down products is in theory supposed to be easily made up by the added amount of revenue the company will receive from the increase in demand . Companies are n't usually only striving for one of the above reasons , Black Friday is inherently a combination of both . Stores experience large surges in the amount of shoppers , so they start off by marking down the prices on inventory which they are trying to get rid of first . Usually the items marked down in price the most are items which have been on the shelves for quite sometimes , or are items which are being replaced by newer models ( or seasonal ) . Deals similar to Black Friday are n't done other times during the year , due to the cyclical nature of retail shopping . It is much more difficult to sell products like televisions or other electronics during the year as compared with the holiday season . Some companies in fact lose a good amount of money maintaining their inventory during the year , only to regain all the lost revenue during the holiday season due to the increase in consumer demand .

    "answer": "Black Friday is a day when many retailers offer special sales and discounts to help kick off the holiday shopping season. It's called Black Friday because it's typically the day when retailers start to \"turn a profit,\" or go \"into the black,\" after being \"in the red\" (meaning they've been losing money) for most of the year. \nWhile it's true that Black Friday can be a very profitable day for retailers, there are a few reasons why they might not offer special deals and discounts more often than once a year: \n1. Limited supply: Many retailers have a limited supply of the items they are discounting on Black Friday. If they offered the same discounts more frequently, they might run out of stock or be unable to make a profit on the sale. \n2. Price sensitivity: People are more likely to buy something when it's on sale, so by offering discounts only once a year, retailers can create a sense of urgency and encourage people to shop on Black Friday. \n3. Competition: Black Friday has become a very competitive event, with retailers trying to outdo each other with bigger and better sales. If retailers offered discounts more frequently, it might not be as special or exciting for shoppers. \n4. Planning: Retailers plan their Black Friday sales well in advance and may have already purchased the items they will be discounting. If they offered discounts more frequently, they might not have enough time to plan and prepare. \nOverall, Black Friday is a way for retailers to drive traffic to their stores and websites, and generate a lot of revenue in a short period of time. However, it's just one part of their overall business strategy and they have to consider a variety of factors when deciding how and when to offer special deals and discounts.",

    "answer": "The human menstrual cycle, which is the period that most people are referring to when they say \"period cycle,\" is typically around 28 days long. This is the time it takes for the body to go through the various changes and stages that are necessary for pregnancy to occur. \nThe menstrual cycle is regulated by hormones produced by the body. These hormones, called estrogen and progesterone, help to control the growth and development of the uterine lining (the endometrium) and the release of an egg from the ovary (ovulation). \nThe length of the menstrual cycle can vary from person to person, but 28 days is considered to be the average length. There are many factors that can affect the length of the menstrual cycle, including stress, illness, certain medications, and changes in diet or exercise. \nThe idea that the menstrual cycle is related to the moon is a myth. The moon has no direct effect on the menstrual cycle, although some people may experience changes in their cycle due to the body's natural circadian rhythms, which can be influenced by changes in light and darkness.",

Essentially, the TV is taking the original 1080p video and adding additional pixels to the image to make it appear as if it has a higher resolution. \nTo do this, the TV uses algorithms to guess what the additional pixels should look like based on the information in the original video. For example, if there is an object in the original video that is a solid color, the TV might use that information to fill in the additional pixels with the same color. If there is a gradient or pattern in the original video, the TV might use that information to create a smoother, more detailed gradient or pattern in the upscaled version. \nWhile upscaling can't actually increase the resolution of the original video, it can make the video look better on a 4K TV by adding more detail and making the image appear sharper. However, it's important to note that upscaled video will never look as good as native 4K video, as the additional pixels are just an approximation of what the higher resolution image should look like.",

    "answer": "9/11 happened . The people who did it were based in Afghanistan . So we went in there and started hunting them down . The administration of the USA , realizing that war was in vogue , said that Iraq has WMDs , and would make future terrorism against the USA possible so they had to take Iraq down a peg early . USA invades Iraq to get rid of the WMDs . It turns out Iraq had no WMDs * that posed a risk to the USA * . USA administration is embarassed at being caught in a bold - faced lie , or being tricked by bad intel . USA administration from that time and their political allies decide to reframe the war as a freedom fighting mission for Iraq . USA finds Saddaam Hussein , turns him over to the people who he dictated over for years , and the people hang him . USA puts in a government that they like and can be chummy with . Government says that democratic elections will be held . Elections put people into power that USA does not like .

Throughout all of this , young men and women from around Iraq are fighting to get the American soldiers out of their homeland and to maintain their older way of life . Those people are labelled insurgents ( because soldiers can not be tortured ) .

    "answer": "The war in Iraq was a conflict that took place in the Middle East between 2003 and 2011. It was fought between the United States and its allies, and Iraq, a country in the Middle East. \nThe conflict began in 2003, when the United States and its allies invaded Iraq, claiming that the Iraqi government led by Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and was a threat to international security. The U.S. and its allies also claimed that Saddam Hussein was a dictator who was mistreating and oppressing the Iraqi people. \nThe U.S. and its allies quickly defeated the Iraqi military, and Saddam Hussein was captured and later executed. However, the conflict did not end there. Insurgent groups, including some who opposed the U.S. presence in Iraq, began attacking American and coalition forces, as well as Iraqi civilians. The conflict continued for many years, with frequent bombings and attacks taking place. \nIn 2011, the U.S. withdrew the majority of its forces from Iraq, but the conflict has continued in the form of an ongoing insurgency and sporadic violence. The war in Iraq has had a significant impact on the Middle East and the rest of the world, and it remains a controversial and divisive issue.",

    "answer": "Roman numerals are a system of numbers that use letters to represent different values. The letters I, V, X, L, C, D, and M are used to represent the numbers 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000, respectively. \nIn the system of Roman numerals, the letter I is used to represent the number 1. The letter V is used to represent the number 5. When these two letters are used together, the letter I is placed before the letter V to represent the number 4. This is written as \"IV\". \nHowever, some wristwatches with Roman numerals use the letter IIII instead of IV to represent the number 4. This is a matter of preference, and it is up to you whether or not you find it bothersome. Some people think that using IIII looks more symmetrical and aesthetically pleasing than using IV, while others prefer the traditional way of writing 4 with Roman numerals. Ultimately, it is a personal decision, and you should choose the wristwatch that you like best.",

    "question": "Why ca n't scars heal ? Explain like i 'm actually 5 years of age . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Scars are like when you have to sew together a hole in your teddy bear . Your skin is like the fabric . Once you cut it , you 're not able to put it back together perfectly . A scar is like the little bumpy sewing line . Now why do n't you go watch Spongebob , so mommy can finish her glass of silly juice ... sorry it 's getting too real . EDIT : I kind of skirted your question . They do n't heal after they are formed because once a tissue can not really change it 's function . Scar tissue does not have the same qualities as skin or muscle or whatever it \" should be \" and it ca n't become something it 's not . Your body is also not really capable of dissolving it later or replacing it , the scar just sits there . It does gain some flexibility over time and tends to change colour but it 's still scar tissue . EDIT : just for reference here 's a better explanation . Your tissues are designed to heal asap . There is no functional benefit to the skin taking it 's time to regrow and reconnect the tissue properly . This is the same basic idea behind blood clotting ; it 's a bad idea to simply wait until the blood vessels heal after they are cut , so rather than make it look pretty , a crappy clot just forms over the wound . With wound healing your body is just trying the patch the tissue ( eg . skin ) as a defence mechanism to protect against infection . A scar is basically just a mass of disorganized tissue held together by a bunch of collagen fibres . It forms quickly and \" good enough \" to cover the wound and hold the tissue together .",

    "question": "Why ca n't scars heal ? Explain like i 'm actually 5 years of age . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Scars are a natural part of the healing process when your skin is injured. When your skin is cut or damaged, your body works to repair the wound by making new skin cells. As the skin heals, a scar may form. Scars are different from the surrounding skin because they don't have the same amount of collagen, which is a protein that helps give skin its strength and elasticity. This is why scars are often flatter and smoother than the skin around them. \nSometimes, scars can be itchy or painful. This is because the scar tissue is still healing and your body is trying to adjust to the new tissue. But over time, the scar tissue will become less sensitive and blend in more with the rest of your skin. \nIt's important to take good care of your skin, especially if you have a cut or wound. Keep the area clean and use a bandage to protect it. This can help prevent infection and speed up the healing process.",

    "question": "Why do some dinosaur bones stay as bones ( fossils ) , and others turn into petroleum ? What processes are happening with each scenario ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Sure! Let's start with dinosaur bones. When a dinosaur dies, its bones are usually covered in dirt or sediment. This helps to protect the bones from being damaged by the environment, such as wind, rain, and sunlight. Over time, the sediment around the bones can harden into rock, and the bones can become fossilized. This means that the bones are preserved and can remain mostly unchanged for millions of years. \nNow, let's talk about petroleum. Petroleum is a type of fossil fuel that is formed from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. When these plants and animals died, they were buried in sediment, just like dinosaur bones. However, instead of turning into fossils, the organic matter in the sediment underwent a series of chemical reactions over time. These reactions transformed the organic matter into a thick, black liquid called crude oil. Crude oil is the raw material used to make gasoline, diesel, and other products. \nSo, in summary, dinosaur bones can become fossils if they are buried in sediment and protected from the environment. Petroleum is formed from the remains of plants and animals that are buried in sediment and undergo chemical reactions over time.",

    "answer": "Lips serve many important functions. One of their main functions is to help us speak and communicate with others. The shape and movement of our lips play a big role in forming the sounds that make up words. Lips also help us to eat and drink by sealing off the mouth and directing food and liquid into the mouth. \nLips are also important for protecting the teeth and mouth. They help to keep out dirt and germs and keep moisture inside the mouth, which helps to keep the teeth and gums healthy. \nLips are different from other parts of the body because they have a special structure that allows them to be flexible and move in different ways. They also contain a lot of blood vessels, which gives them their reddish color. The skin on the lips is also thinner and more delicate than the skin on other parts of the body, which is why they can be more sensitive to touch and temperature. \nOverall, lips play a crucial role in helping us to communicate, eat, and protect our teeth and mouth.",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why movie video game sounds may seem retro to some people. One reason is that movie makers often use sound effects from older video games to evoke a sense of nostalgia or to create a specific atmosphere. These sounds may remind viewers of the classic video games they played when they were younger, which can be a pleasant or humorous experience. \nAnother reason may be that movie makers want to avoid using current video game sounds, as they may be copyrighted and difficult to obtain permission to use. Using older video game sounds can be a way to avoid these legal issues. \nAdditionally, using retro video game sounds can also be a creative choice made by movie makers as a way to add an element of whimsy or humor to a scene. \nOverall, the use of retro video game sounds in movies is not necessarily an in-joke, but rather a stylistic choice that can be used for a variety of purposes.",

    "answer": "Ely5 as much as possible : Your body stops making some chemicals in response to constantly having alcohol in your system . When you suddenly stop drinking , it takes your body a while to realize it needs to make those chemicals again . The lag time between stopping alcohol and chemical production can be a decent amount of time . That 's \" withdrawal \" , basically . With alcohol and benzos , that chemical imbalance can be serious enough to kill you . Edit ; as others have corrected me , I figured I 'd add this for clarity . My post is mostly right , but backwards . The brain does n't stop making chemicals . It makes way too much , and the alcohol stops the chemicals from working as much .

    "answer": "Alcohol withdrawal can be intense and potentially fatal because the body has become dependent on alcohol and needs it to function normally. When a person who has been drinking heavily stops drinking alcohol suddenly, their body can have a negative reaction because it is no longer receiving the substance it has become used to. This can cause the body to go into withdrawal, which can produce a range of symptoms such as tremors, seizures, and hallucinations. In severe cases, alcohol withdrawal can lead to delirium tremens, which is a condition that causes confusion, rapid heartbeat, and high fever. Delirium tremens can be life-threatening if left untreated. \nIt's important to note that alcohol withdrawal can be managed and treated safely by medical professionals.

    "answer": "Canadian healthcare, also known as \"Medicare,\" is a publicly funded healthcare system that provides universal coverage to all Canadian citizens and permanent residents. This means that all Canadian residents have access to a range of healthcare services, including hospital care, physician services, and prescription medications, at no direct cost to the patient. The healthcare system is funded through taxes paid by Canadians, and the services are provided by a combination of public and private hospitals and healthcare providers. \nObamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), is a healthcare reform law that was passed in the United States in 2010. It was designed to make healthcare more accessible and affordable for Americans by expanding coverage to more people and requiring insurance companies to offer certain minimum benefits. However, unlike in Canada, the United States does not have a universal healthcare system, and many Americans still do not have access to affordable healthcare. Instead, the ACA relies on a combination of private insurance companies and government-funded programs, such as Medicaid, to provide coverage to Americans. \nThere are a number of differences between the Canadian healthcare system and Obamacare. One of the main differences is that the Canadian system is universal, while the ACA only covers certain individuals. Another difference is that the Canadian system is funded through taxes, while the ACA relies on a combination of private insurance premiums and government funding. Finally, the Canadian system is administered by the government, while the ACA involves both private insurance companies and government programs.",

    "answer": "The Rosetta mission was a big deal because it was the first time that a spacecraft had landed on a comet. A comet is a small, icy body that orbits the sun. They are made up of dust and ice and are often called \"dirty snowballs.\" \nComets are interesting to scientists because they are thought to contain clues about the formation and early history of the solar system. The Rosetta spacecraft was launched in 2004 and it spent more than 10 years traveling through space before it reached the comet it was going to land on. \nLanding on a comet is different from landing on a planet like the moon or Mars because comets are much smaller and have a very weak gravity. This makes it difficult for a spacecraft to land on a comet and stay there. The Rosetta mission was able to land on the comet using a special landing module called the Philae lander. The Philae lander was able to anchor itself to the surface of the comet and take measurements and collect samples of the comet's surface. \nOverall, the Rosetta mission was a big deal because it allowed scientists to learn more about comets and the early history of the solar system. It also showed that it is possible to land a spacecraft on a comet, which could open up new possibilities for future space missions.",

    "answer": "Netflix uses a variety of algorithms and techniques to recommend shows and movies to its users. One of the ways it does this is by looking at the viewing habits and preferences of people who have watched similar shows or movies. For example, if a lot of people who have watched \"Revenge\" have also watched \"Clifford the Big Red Dog,\" Netflix's recommendation system might suggest \"Clifford the Big Red Dog\" to someone who has just finished watching \"Revenge.\" \nAnother way Netflix makes recommendations is by looking at the genres and themes of the shows and movies that a person has watched. For example, if someone has watched a lot of shows and movies that are classified as \"dramas\" or \"thrillers,\" Netflix might recommend other shows or movies that are also classified as dramas or thrillers. \"Clifford the Big Red Dog\" is a children's show, so it's possible that Netflix's recommendation system is taking into account the fact that you have watched \"Revenge,\" which is a drama, and is suggesting \"Clifford the Big Red Dog\" as a show that is in a different genre that you might enjoy. \nIt's also possible that Netflix is suggesting \"Clifford the Big Red Dog\" to you because it is a popular show that is suitable for all ages, and Netflix wants to make sure that it is suggesting content that will appeal to a wide range of viewers. \nI hope this helps!

    "question": "What is the difference between a computer sleeping and hibernating ? If these could be juxtaposed that would be great ! Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "When a computer is sleeping, it is in a low-power state where it can quickly wake up and start working again. This is useful if you plan to use the computer again soon, because it saves energy and allows you to start working faster. \nWhen a computer is hibernating, it is in a low-power state where it saves the current state of the computer to the hard drive and then turns off. This is useful if you are not going to use the computer for a longer period of time, because it saves more energy than sleeping and allows you to start working again exactly where you left off. \nTo put it simply, sleeping is like taking a short nap, while hibernating is like going to bed for the night. Both can help save energy and make it easier to start using the computer again, but hibernating is a little more \"serious\" because it involves saving all your work and shutting down completely.",

    "question": "Why do hospitals and psych - wards get abandoned ? Why are these places not immediately re - purposed ? And even when they are left why do people explore these places and try to get murdered ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Hospitals and psych wards can become abandoned for a variety of reasons. Some hospitals may be shut down due to financial difficulties, changes in healthcare policies, or the closure of a particular medical service or department. Psych wards may be closed due to changes in the way mental health treatment is provided, or because the facility is no longer up to modern standards of care. \nThere are also many hospitals and psych wards that are simply old and have become outdated or dilapidated over time. In some cases, these facilities may be abandoned because it is more cost-effective to build a new hospital or psych ward rather than renovate the old one. \nAs for why people explore abandoned hospitals and psych wards, it is often because they are curious about the history of the place and want to see what it looks like inside. Some people may also be drawn to the eerie or spooky atmosphere of these abandoned buildings. However, it is important to remember that exploring abandoned buildings can be dangerous, and it is never a good idea to try to get murdered or put oneself in harm's way.",

    "question": "How X - rays are produced ? Studying A level physics , wondering if anyone can give me a clear explanation . Thank you . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "X-rays are a type of electromagnetic radiation, similar to light or radio waves. They have a shorter wavelength and higher frequency than visible light and are not visible to the human eye. \nTo produce X-rays, a machine called an X-ray generator is used. The generator has an electron gun, which is a device that produces a stream of high-energy electrons. These electrons are accelerated through a tube inside the generator and are then directed towards a metal target, usually made of tungsten. \nAs the high-energy electrons collide with the metal target, they release energy in the form of X-rays. This process is called bremsstrahlung, which means \"braking radiation\" in German. The X-rays produced by the generator are then directed towards the part of the body being examined, and they pass through the body and are captured on film or a digital detector on the other side. \nX-rays are used in many medical and industrial applications because they can pass through most materials and produce images of the inside of objects. They are particularly useful for examining bones, as they are absorbed by soft tissue but not by bone. This allows doctors to see the inside of the body and identify any problems or injuries.",

    "question": "Why is milk more expensive than gas ? Why are milk prices government regulated ( in the us ) when it 's a renewable resource ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Milk is more expensive than gas for a number of reasons. One reason is that the production of milk requires more resources and labor than the production of gasoline. For example, milk is produced on farms where cows must be raised, fed, and cared for, while gasoline is produced in refineries using crude oil as a raw material. \nAnother reason is that the demand for milk is generally higher than the demand for gasoline. Milk is a staple food that is consumed by people all around the world, while gasoline is mostly used for transportation and is not as essential for daily life. As a result, the price of milk is able to be higher than the price of gasoline. \nMilk prices in the United States are regulated by the government in order to help ensure that farmers are able to make a living and that the supply of milk remains stable. The government sets the minimum price that milk must be sold for, which helps to protect farmers from being underpaid for their product. This regulation also helps to ensure that there is a consistent supply of milk available for consumers.",

    "answer": "In the animal kingdom, it is common for certain behaviors or characteristics to become more common within a population over time. This is often due to natural selection, where individuals with certain traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those traits down to their offspring. \nFor example, if a bird starts singing a new song and other birds find it attractive, they may be more likely to mate with that bird, and their offspring may also learn to sing the same song. Over time, the song may become more common within the population. \nThis process is not the same as what we typically think of as \"popularity\" in human society, where popularity is often based on personal qualities or social status rather than on the ability to survive and reproduce. However, it is similar in the sense that certain traits or behaviors can become more common within a group over time.",

It's also possible that some lower-class individuals may feel that they do not have the power or resources to advocate for their own interests and may therefore support policies or ideas that they believe will benefit society as a whole, even if it doesn't directly benefit them. \nAdditionally, it's important to note that the concept of \"class\" is complex and multifaceted, and people's views and beliefs can be influenced by a variety of factors, including their education, upbringing, and personal experiences. It's also worth considering that people may not always be aware of the ways in which certain policies or ideas may disproportionately impact different groups within society. \nUltimately, it's important to recognize that people's beliefs and opinions are often influenced by a wide range of factors and that it can be difficult to fully understand someone's perspective without considering the context in which they hold it.",

    "answer": "Saving a Word file as a PDF is easy because PDF (Portable Document Format) is a file format that was designed to be read on any device, regardless of the software or hardware used to create it. When you save a Word file as a PDF, you're essentially taking the contents of the Word file and converting them into a format that can be easily read and shared by anyone, even if they don't have Word or any other word processing software installed on their computer. \nOn the other hand, converting a PDF back into a Word file can be more complex because a PDF doesn't contain the same kind of formatting and structure as a Word file. When you create a Word file, you can add things like headings, bullet points, tables, and other formatting elements that make it easy to organize and read the document. PDFs, on the other hand, are typically used for documents that are meant to be printed or shared as-is, rather than edited. So, when you try to convert a PDF back into a Word file, the software has to try to recreate all of those formatting elements and structure the document in a way that makes sense. This can be challenging, especially if the PDF contains a lot of complex formatting or images. \nThat's why there are specialized tools, like Adobe Acrobat, that are designed specifically for converting PDFs into other formats. These tools can often do a better job of preserving the formatting and structure of the original PDF when converting it into a Word file or other editable format. However, these tools can also be expensive, which is why there are also free online converters that you can use to try to convert PDFs into Word files or other formats. These free tools may not be as powerful or accurate as the paid ones, but they can still be useful if you just need to make a few quick edits to a PDF.",

    "answer": "In most countries, it is not illegal to belong to a gang in and of itself. However, being a member of a gang can make it more likely that a person will engage in criminal activity, and if a person does commit a crime while they are a member of a gang, they may face additional penalties or consequences. This is because being a member of a gang can sometimes be seen as evidence of a person's involvement in criminal activity. \nIn addition, many countries have laws that allow authorities to take action against gangs if they are found to be engaging in criminal activity. For example, a gang might be labeled as a \"criminal organization\" and members could be charged with participating in or supporting the criminal activities of the gang. \nIt is important to note that being a member of a gang does not automatically mean that a person has committed a crime, and a person cannot be charged with a crime simply for belonging to a gang.

    "answer": "Sure! Here is a breakdown of the differences between murder, assassination, and manslaughter: \nMurder: Murder is the most serious of these crimes. It is the unlawful killing of another person with intent, or malice. This means that the person who committed the murder planned to kill the victim or acted with the intention of causing serious harm. Murder is usually punishable by life in prison or the death penalty, depending on the laws of the jurisdiction. \nAssassination: Assassination is a specific type of murder that involves killing someone for political reasons, such as to advance a political cause or to gain power. It is often carried out secretly and can involve a conspiracy, or group of people working together, to plan and execute the murder. \nManslaughter: Manslaughter is a less serious crime than murder. It involves the unlawful killing of another person, but without the intention to kill. There are two main types of manslaughter: voluntary and involuntary. Voluntary manslaughter occurs when a person intentionally kills another person in the heat of the moment, often in response to some kind of provocation. Involuntary manslaughter occurs when a person unintentionally kills another person while engaging in reckless or negligent behavior. For example, if someone was driving while drunk and crashed their car, killing another person, they could be charged with involuntary manslaughter. Manslaughter is usually punishable by a prison sentence, but the length of the sentence will depend on the circumstances of the crime. \nI hope this helps!

    "answer": "There are a few ways that farmers can propagate seedless fruits. One method is through a process called \"grafting.\" This involves taking a piece of a mature fruit tree that is producing good fruit and attaching it to the root system of a young, healthy tree. The piece of the mature tree that is used is called a \"scion,\" and the young tree is called the \"rootstock.\" When the scion is grafted onto the rootstock, the rootstock provides the roots and base of the tree, while the scion provides the fruit-producing part of the tree. \nAnother way that farmers can propagate seedless fruits is through a process called \"cutting.\" This involves taking a cutting from a mature fruit tree and planting it in soil or water. The cutting will then begin to grow roots and eventually develop into a new tree. \nSeedless fruits can also be propagated through a process called \"layering.\" This involves bending a low-growing branch of a fruit tree down to the ground and covering it with soil. As the branch begins to grow roots, it can be cut off from the parent tree and planted as a new tree. \nFinally, seedless fruits can also be propagated through a process called \"micropropagation.\" This involves taking a small piece of tissue from a mature fruit tree and growing it in a laboratory setting. The tissue is placed in a special nutrient solution and allowed to grow into a new plant. Once the plant is large enough, it can be transferred to soil and grown into a full-sized tree.",

    "answer": "Valves, also known as tubes, are used in guitar amplifiers because they can produce a warm, rich sound that is different from the sound produced by solid-state electronics. The way that tubes work is by using an electrical current to heat up a filament, which then produces a flow of electrons through a vacuum. This flow of electrons can be controlled using various components, such as resistors and capacitors, to shape the sound of the amplifier. \nWhile solid-state electronics have become more common in modern amplifiers, many musicians and audiophiles still prefer the sound of tubes because they feel that it is more natural and organic. Some people also enjoy the added complexity and maintenance required by tube amplifiers, as it gives them a chance to tinker with their gear and make it sound just the way they want it. \nOverall, the use of tubes in guitar amplifiers is a matter of personal preference, and whether or not they are used is largely dependent on the desired sound and feel of the amplifier.",

    "answer": "The feeling of \"pins and needles\" or tingling occurs when there is decreased blood flow to a specific area of the body. This can happen when a limb is in an awkward position and the blood flow is cut off, or if there is some other issue with the circulation of blood. \nWhen the blood flow is cut off, the cells in that area don't receive enough oxygen and nutrients. This can cause the cells to become damaged or die. As a result, the brain may interpret this as a sensation of pins and needles. \nThe sensation of pins and needles is actually a way for the body to alert you that something is wrong and that you should move the limb to restore blood flow. If the limb stays in the same position for too long, it can lead to more serious problems, such as muscle damage or even nerve damage. \nIt's not really possible for the limb to feel numb or pleasant when blood flow is cut off, because the lack of blood flow is what is causing the issue in the first place.

    "answer": "Cathode ray tubes (CRTs) are electronic devices that are used to display images on old television sets and computer monitors. They work by shooting a beam of electrons at a fluorescent screen, which then emits light to create the image. \nThe beam of electrons is produced by a cathode, which is a negatively charged electrode located at the back of the CRT. The cathode is heated to a high temperature, which causes it to emit a stream of electrons. These electrons are then accelerated towards the front of the CRT by an electrical field. \nAs the beam of electrons travels towards the front of the CRT, it passes through a series of deflection plates, which are electrical components that can change the direction of the beam. These deflection plates are controlled by the television signal, which tells them how to move the beam to create the desired image on the screen. \nThe beam of electrons then hits the fluorescent screen, which is coated with a layer of phosphors. The phosphors are tiny particles that glow when struck by electrons. Different colors are produced by different types of phosphors, so the beam of electrons can create a range of colors on the screen by hitting different phosphors. \nOverall, CRTs are able to create precise images by using a beam of electrons that can be precisely controlled by the television signal to create the desired image on the screen.",

    "question": "Why do the British courts change / hide the identities of criminals ? Like Jon Venables and Robert Thompson , for instance ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "In the United Kingdom, the identities of some criminals, particularly those who were under the age of 18 at the time of their offense, are protected by law in order to prevent them from being subjected to vigilante justice or other harm. This means that their names and other identifying information may not be made public. \nIn the case of Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, they were both 10 years old when they were convicted of the murder of 2-year-old James Bulger in 1993. Because they were minors at the time of the crime, their identities were protected by law. This protection has been continued even after they were released from custody, in part because there have been concerns about their safety and the potential for them to be targeted by those who are angry or upset about the crime they committed. \nOverall, the decision to protect the identities of certain criminals is made in the interest of ensuring that they are able to receive a fair trial and to protect their safety once they have served their sentence.",

    "question": "Why does a cone form in the start up of a space shuttle engine ? ( Pic in description ) URL_0 Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "A cone, or plume, forms when a space shuttle engine starts up because of the way that the fuel is burned. When the fuel is ignited, it creates hot gases that expand rapidly and escape through the nozzle at the back of the engine. As the gases escape, they push against the surrounding air, creating a cone-shaped plume. \nThe shape of the plume is determined by a number of factors, including the shape of the nozzle, the temperature and pressure of the gases, and the properties of the surrounding air. The plume can also be influenced by the shape and size of the vehicle, as well as the position of the engine. \nOverall, the plume forms because of the basic laws of physics that govern how gases behave when they are heated and pressurized. It is an important part of the space shuttle's propulsion system, as it helps to provide the thrust that is needed to lift the vehicle off the ground and into space.",

    "question": "Why do musicians / bands normally lay down persian rugs when recording an album or playing a gig ? Here is a good [ example ] ( URL_0 ) Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Musicians and bands often use Persian rugs in their recording studios or on stage because they can help to absorb sound and reduce echoes. This can make the sound more clear and improve the overall quality of the music. \nWhen sound waves travel through the air, they can bounce off of hard surfaces like walls, floors, and ceilings. This can create echoes, which can make the sound feel less clear and less professional. Persian rugs are made of soft, plush materials that can absorb sound waves and reduce the amount of echo in a room. \nBy laying down a Persian rug in a recording studio or on stage, musicians and bands can help to create a better sound environment that allows them to produce high-quality recordings or performances. The use of Persian rugs is just one of many techniques that musicians and sound engineers use to achieve the best possible sound quality.",

    "question": "Why is it sometimes really hard to peel an egg without removing chunks of egg white ? Perhaps one of the most mildly infuriating things in my life . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Peeling hard-boiled eggs can sometimes be tricky because the egg white tends to stick to the eggshell. This can happen for a few different reasons. One reason is that the egg white is more likely to stick to the shell if the egg is older. As an egg gets older, the egg white tends to become more watery and less viscous, which makes it more likely to stick to the shell. Another reason is that the egg white may stick to the shell if the egg was not cooked properly. If the egg was not cooked long enough, the egg white may not have fully set, which can make it more difficult to peel the egg. Finally, the egg white may stick to the shell if the egg was not cooled properly after cooking. If the egg was not cooled quickly enough, the egg white may become more difficult to peel.",

    "question": "Why do I have tonput the clutch down before braking / stopping I 'm learning to drive and I just do it but I do n't really know why . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "A lot of people are saying that the clutch disconnects the engine from the wheels . True , but it 's only one of two things that does so , the other being shifting the gearbox into neutral . You should n't be sitting at a stoplight with the gearbox in gear and the clutch down . Holding the clutch down is bad for it . Rather , the clutch is for * briefly * disconnecting the engine , which takes the stress off the gearbox , allowing you to shift out of gear easily and without damaging the gearbox . [ edit ] [ Car Talk agrees with me . ] ( URL_0 ) > RAY : Used correctly , the throw - out bearing will last much longer than the clutch disc . But if you sit at red lights with your foot on the clutch pedal all the time , you can wear out the throw - out bearing before you wear out your clutch disc .

    "question": "Why do I have tonput the clutch down before braking / stopping I 'm learning to drive and I just do it but I do n't really know why . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "When you are driving a manual transmission vehicle, the clutch is used to connect and disconnect the engine from the wheels. When you push the clutch pedal down, it disconnects the engine from the wheels, allowing you to change gears. \nWhen you are braking or coming to a stop, it's important to push the clutch down before you come to a complete stop. This is because if you leave the clutch engaged (not pressed down) while the car is stopped, it can cause the engine to stall. \nStalling the engine can be inconvenient and potentially dangerous, especially if you are driving in heavy traffic or on a busy road. By pushing the clutch down before you come to a stop, you can avoid stalling the engine and ensure a smooth stop. \nIt's also a good habit to get into because it can help you to smoothly shift into neutral when you come to a stop, rather than suddenly trying to find the right gear at the last minute. \nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

    "answer": "When someone burns to death, it means that their body is completely engulfed in flames and they sustain severe burns all over their body. The actual cause of death in this case is typically due to the combination of several factors, including: \n1. Smoke inhalation: When someone is on fire, they will inhale a lot of smoke, which can damage their airways and cause respiratory failure. \n2. Burns: Burns are a major cause of death in cases of immolation. Severe burns can cause the skin and underlying tissues to die, leading to organ failure and death. \n3. Shock: The body can go into shock due to the severe trauma and pain caused by the burns. Shock can cause a person's blood pressure to drop to dangerous levels, leading to organ failure and death. \n4. Asphyxiation: If the flames completely engulf the person's head and face, it can lead to asphyxiation (suffocation) due to the lack of oxygen. \nIn summary, the actual cause of death in cases of immolation is usually a combination of smoke inhalation, burns, shock, and asphyxiation. These factors can cause severe damage to the body's tissues and organs, leading to organ failure and death.",

    "answer": "There are several reasons why many financial companies have a presence in Omaha, Nebraska. \nFirst, Omaha has a strong economy and a highly educated workforce, which makes it an attractive place for businesses to locate. Many financial companies value the stability and reliability of the Omaha economy, which can be attractive for long-term business planning. \nSecond, Omaha is home to several major financial institutions, including Berkshire Hathaway, which is one of the largest and most successful investment firms in the world. This has helped to create a cluster of financial businesses in the city, as many companies have chosen to locate near these major players in the industry. \nFinally, Omaha is a relatively inexpensive place to do business compared to other major cities in the United States. This can be attractive for financial companies looking to reduce costs and increase profits. \nOverall, there is no legal reason why financial companies are located in Omaha, but rather a combination of economic and business factors that have led to the concentration of financial businesses in the city.",

    "answer": "There are many factors that can contribute to a team's record fluctuating from year to year in the NFL. \nOne reason is that each team has a roster of players, and the players on a team can change from year to year. For example, a team might lose some of their best players to injury or to other teams, or they might bring in new players through the draft or free agency. When a team has a lot of changes to their roster, it can take time for the new players to get used to playing together and for the team to find their rhythm. This can lead to a team's record fluctuating. \nAnother reason is that each team plays a different schedule of games each year. One year, a team might have a lot of tough opponents and have a harder time winning games. The next year, they might have an easier schedule and have more success. \nThere are also many other factors that can affect a team's performance, such as the coaching staff, the team's overall strategy and game plan, and the overall level of talent and depth on the team.

    "answer": "Becoming vegetarian for the sake of animal rights can help animals in a few different ways. First, it can reduce the demand for animal products, which in turn can lead to fewer animals being raised and killed for food. This can help to reduce the suffering of these animals and improve their overall welfare. \nAnother way that becoming vegetarian can help animals is by supporting companies and organizations that are committed to humane treatment of animals. When you choose to buy vegetarian products or support organizations that advocate for animal welfare, you are helping to promote these values and encourage more companies to adopt similar practices. \nIt's important to note that becoming vegetarian is just one way that individuals can make a difference for animals. There are many other ways to get involved in animal welfare, such as volunteering at animal shelters, supporting animal rights organizations, and advocating for animal-friendly policies.

    "answer": "The labels on lumber, such as \"2x4\" or \"2x6\", refer to the rough size of the wood before it has been planed smooth or finished. The rough size is the size of the wood as it comes straight from the sawmill or lumber mill, and it includes the bark and rough edges of the wood. The rough size is usually larger than the actual finished size of the wood, which is the size of the wood after it has been planed smooth and all of the rough edges have been removed. \nSo, when a piece of wood is labeled as a \"2x4\", it means that it is roughly 2 inches thick and 4 inches wide, but the actual finished size of the wood will be slightly smaller, around 1.75 inches thick and 3.5 inches wide. This is because some of the rough, unfinished wood must be removed during the finishing process in order to create a smooth, finished surface. \nI hope this helps to explain why the labels on lumber don't always match the actual finished size of the wood.",

    "answer": "The process of extracting metal from rocks, or ore, is called smelting. Humans have been smelting metals for thousands of years. \nTo extract metal from ore, we need to heat it up to a very high temperature. This is because the metal is mixed in with other elements and we need to separate it. To do this, we put the ore in a special furnace called a smelter. The smelter is like a really hot oven that can reach temperatures of over 2000 degrees Fahrenheit. \nWhen we heat the ore in the smelter, the metal becomes a liquid. This is because the heat makes the metal particles move faster and they start to break away from the other elements in the ore. The metal then flows to the bottom of the smelter and collects in a special container called a crucible. \nOnce the metal has cooled and solidified, we can take it out of the crucible and use it to make things like weapons and tools. \nIt's not exactly clear how humans first figured out this process, but it's likely that they learned through trial and error. They may have noticed that certain types of rocks produced a shiny, metallic substance when they were heated, and they experimented with different methods to extract and purify the metal.",

This can make it a bit tricky to eat and drink, because the food and drinks can float around and be hard to hold onto. \nTo eat in space, astronauts use special utensils that are designed to be used in zero gravity. These utensils are often attached to the food packaging or to a tray so they don't float away. The food itself is also often packed in special containers that are easy to open and eat from in space. \nDrinking in space can be a bit trickier, because liquids tend to float around and can be hard to control. To drink in space, astronauts use special containers with straws or tubes that they can suck on to get the liquid to flow into their mouths. They also have to be careful not to drink too much at once, because the liquid could float out of their mouths and make a mess. \nOverall, eating and drinking in space requires some special tools and techniques, but it's not too different from how we do it on Earth.

    "answer": "I work in big data and identity theft protection , this is my field of expertise ! * * Assuming they only have the SSN * * A social security number by itself is useless . The only thing you can learn from a social security number is the year and location of issuance . This information can be gathered from the High Group List . If the SSN was issued after June 2011 , you ca n't use the HGL on it anymore ( the SSA started [ SSN randomization ] ( URL_5 ) ) . You can also check to see if the holder is deceased or not . This information used to be published monthly by the SSA : name , ssn , dob , dod , last known zipcode , and \" proof code \" . This was called the Death Master File ( DMF ) . The SSA used to publish this monthly in the name of fraud prevention ( they did n't want anyone using recently deceased information to take out loans and such ) . Last year they stopped publishing this information - again in the name of \" fraud prevention \" - because nobody was taking advantage of the DMF when issuing loans . The only people who ever used it were the criminals . Now they wait a year or two before publishing any of the deceased info . * * Assuming they have more than the SSN * * Data thieves work by following leads - just like a detective . If you have a name and SSN , you 're almost always able to get MORE information . Just follow the thread and employ a bit of social engineering . The easiest thing to do with your name and SSN is to e - file your taxes for you with bogus wages . I tell the IRS that I want a debit card with my refund on it and I get away with your tax return . * * You can prevent this by requesting a PIN from the IRS . * * Even if you do n't think you have been or will be targeted , get a PIN from the IRS . This prevents people from filing your taxes for you and getting a bogus refund . What else can I do with your name and SSN ? Well , I * probably * know where you live ( I can use the high group list and hope you never moved or I can do an internet search to find your online profiles - especially if you have a unique name ) . From there , I can likely find your address . There are TONS of people finding websites out there which use public \" consumer \" data . I 'll go into that more later . A perfect example is [ PeopleSmart ] ( URL_4 ) ( not the best data , but you get the idea ) . Again , this is PUBLIC DATA . All I have to do in order to get lots of info on you is pay for it . Most places will charge 10 - 50 bucks per report . What 's in a report ? Name , DOB , address history , phone numbers , relatives , criminal records , BLJ records ( bankruptcies , liens , and judgements ) , vehicle registration records , voter registration records , professional licenses , employment history ( though that 's getting harder to find these days ) , and the list goes on . Now I have everything I 'll ever need to destroy your life . I can have IDs made in your name - which is not hard for a criminal ( just head over to /r / fakeid ) . Or I can get REAL ids from the state agencies by pretending to be you . Lots of agencies will issue a new ID if you show them a bill with your name on it ( I 'll just stop by your house while you 're at work , steal a bill out of your mail , head to the DMV and claim to be you ) . So now I 've got all your information and valid ( or fake ) IDs in your name . What next ? Apply for credit cards , loans , and services in your name . I max them out and leave you to pay the bills . * * What are the best ways to prevent this ? * * - * * Get credit monitoring * * . Most banks offer this for a small monthly fee ( 5 - 10 bucks ) . It will not STOP someone from applying for credit in your name , but it will alert you when it does happen . If you can stop it before it goes too far , you 're likely to come out of this clean . If you let it go on for months , it 's a lot harder to prove that you 're the victim of ID fraud . - * * Get a filing PIN from the IRS * * . This prevents people from filing your taxes for you and getting a refund . It 's VERY easy to do - just google \" irs filing pin \" and you 'll be well on your way . If you forget your PIN , you just need to visit the local taxation office ( most states have a few of them ) . - * * Do n't opt - in . * * I mentioned \" consumer data \" earlier . Consumer data is data that 's collected from companies that you buy stuff from . Magazine subscriptions , online services , credit cards , loans , etc . Have you ever noticed that once you get a magazine subscription , suddenly you get tons of junk mail for other magazines ? Well , people buy this consumer data in bulk and look for people who recently bought magazines , put them in a mailing list , and dispatch the spam . Your profile consists of TONS of metrics . This includes your personal info ( name , address , phone , dob , etc ) , your property data ( own vs rent , house vs apartment , pool / no pool , central heating ? , number of fireplaces ? number of bedrooms ? etc ) , your hobbies and interests , the number of children you have ( and their ages ) , the number of pets you have , and just about anything else that you might learn about a person while taking a 101 language course . * * So what do you do ? * * Sign up for these services with fake information . Need to buy something online ? Use a prepaid debit card . And READ THE PRIVACY POLICY ! - * * Opt - out * * . Almost every website that sells consumer data will allow you to opt - out of their databases . If they do n't , send them a letter in the mail requesting an opt - out . If they ignore , get a lawyer to sign it . Most websites have an online form that lets you do this . [ Here 's a link to PeopleSmart 's ] ( URL_1 ) . The problem with this is that there are TONS of websites out there with your information . You could spend years doing it . Luckily there are a lot of services that will automate this process for you . Someone on reddit also made a link to the biggest ones and their opt - out forms : [ link ] ( URL_3 ) - * * Do n't give information that 's not necessary ! * * Lots of doctors offices , banks , and other places will ask for your SSN but they do n't actually NEED it . Leave it blank and only fill it in if they can explain to you why they need it . Legally , the only people who can * * require * * your SSN are the IRS . - * * Call The Big 3 * * ( TransUnion , Equifax , and Experian - and increasingly Lexis ) . They will NOT remove ID theft activity from your credit report unless you fight them . Eventually they will remove it ( especially if you have a lawyer ) but they 'll resist a LOT before they do . They 'll tell you that they 're just \" reporting what has been reported to them \" and \" our credit scores only reflect the data \" and other BS . Do n't give up ! The bigger the company , the more fuss they 'll make . - * * Get a police report ! * * Contact the FTC , attorney general , and SSA . The FTC will be one of your biggest allies throughout your battle , believe it or not . Most of them wo n't do crap without a police report , though - especially the SSA . After enough noise , the SSA will give you a new SSN , but you must prove that the SSN was actually USED . - * * Get your criminal records expunged ASAP * * Most courts offer this for free ( or a small fee ) if the record is over a certain age . Background check companies scrape county courthouse websites ALL THE TIME to gather these records . If your data is expunged , you can sue anyone who does not remove the record from their website ( though you have to give them a 2 week notice , usually ) . - * * Move out of Florida * * No joke , Florida sells EVERY bit of residential information they possibly can . They sell it all to data companies for extra revenue . Most states sell this information , but not all of it . Florida is the worst . Hunting licenses , fishing licenses , driving records , criminal records , voter registration records , all of it . - * * Do n't register to vote * * ( or if you do , URGE your congressmen to stop selling voter registration data ) . Voter registration data is sold in most states in bulk . It includes name , phone number , party affiliation , address , and DOB ( though a lot of them are now trying to only give the year of birth ) . Some states GIVE this information away for free . [ Ohio has a search feature for it ] ( URL_0 ) ( they used to just dump it all on an FTP for free ) . Most states make you fill out a form and pay a few hundred bucks for the data , though . * * Edit :* * If you have any other questions , * * please contact me * * . I really do n't mind answering questions about this . I honestly know more about the data end , but I 've been in this field for 5 years now and have learned a LOT through experience . I 'd be happy to explain more about how the data gets bought and sold from one company to the next ( that 's mostly what I do ) . * * Edit 2 :* * Just thought I 'd mention who 's who in this world of data selling . Some of the biggest data - resellers ( bulk data ) are Acxiom and InfoUSA . Acxiom sells mostly online data ( they do customer tracking using IP addresses and cookies and then link it up to your real world profile for advertisers ) . InfoUSA sells demographic info for mailing lists . Looking for all the single mothers with 2 children and 3 dogs in zipcodes with less than 1000 residents ? That 's the kind of targeted mail - advertising InfoUSA offers . Though they do n't do the mailing themselves - they just sell the data . Background check companies are huge . There 's too many to count ! BeenVerified has decent data , URL_2 has subpar data , TLO ( now Transunion ) has excellent data , and I ca n't really speak for the others that much . Everyone else has scraped data . * * Edit 3 :* * Added a few new bullet points above",

    "question": "What 's the worst an identity thief could do if they somehow stole my social security number but nothing else ? I always hear this as a cautionary piece of advice regarding my internet habits but it seems dubious . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Identity thieves can use your social security number to try to steal your identity and commit various types of fraud. For example, they could try to open credit card accounts or loans in your name, apply for government benefits, or even file tax returns using your social security number. If they are successful, they could damage your credit score and ruin your financial reputation. They could also use your personal information to impersonate you and engage in other illegal activities. \nIt is important to protect your social security number and other personal information online and in the real world. This includes being careful about who you share your information with, using strong passwords, and keeping your computer and other devices secure. You should also monitor your financial accounts regularly and check your credit report periodically to make sure that there are no unauthorized activities or accounts. If you think your identity has been stolen, you should act quickly to minimize the damage and report the theft to the appropriate authorities.",

    "answer": "Developers make \"better\" compression algorithms by finding ways to compress data more efficiently. This means that they are able to reduce the size of the data while still maintaining the same quality. There are a few different ways that they can do this. \nOne way is by finding more efficient ways to represent the data. For example, instead of representing each pixel in an image as a separate piece of information, they might use patterns or colors to represent groups of pixels. This can help to reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored. \nAnother way is by finding more efficient ways to compress the data. This might involve using algorithms that are more efficient at finding patterns in the data, or using techniques like predictive coding to better estimate what data is most important to keep. \nFinally, developers can also make new codecs (compression algorithms for audio and video) better by improving the way that they handle different types of data. For example, they might create codecs that are better at compressing video with a lot of fast-moving action, or codecs that are better at compressing audio with a wide range of frequencies. \nOverall, the goal of compression algorithms is to reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored or transmitted, while still maintaining the quality of the original data. As technology and our understanding of data compression improve, we are able to create more efficient algorithms that can compress data even more effectively.",

About 1/5 of the population are what we call highly suggestible . Through a series of physical tricks we can narrow down an audience to see who is the most receptive to suggestion and then we exploit that on stage . Hypnosis in a clinical setting it is similar but it takes longer depending on the person , there is a series of tasks that essentially associates what the hypnotist says with reality until the lines blur and what the hypnotist says becomes their reality .

    "question": "Hypnotism . How does it work , why does it work and where can I learn ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Hypnotism, also known as hypnosis, is a method of inducing a trance-like state in a person in order to alter their behavior, thoughts, or feelings. It is often used in therapy to help people overcome problems such as anxiety, phobias, and pain. \nDuring hypnosis, a person is typically asked to focus their attention on a particular object or thought, and to relax their body and mind. The hypnotist may also use certain techniques such as repeating a specific phrase or making suggestions to the person while they are in this relaxed state. \nThe exact reason why hypnosis works is not fully understood, but it is thought that it may help a person to bypass their conscious mind and access their subconscious mind, where habits, memories, and emotions are stored. This can allow the hypnotist to make suggestions or give commands that the person may be more receptive to, or to help the person access and overcome negative thoughts or behaviors. \nThere are many places where you can learn about hypnosis and how to use it. You can find books on the subject at a library or bookstore, or you can search online for articles and videos about hypnosis. Some schools and universities also offer courses on hypnosis, and there are professional organizations that offer certification programs for people who want to learn how to use hypnosis in a therapeutic setting.",

    "answer": "When a space shuttle launches, it does so at very high speeds, often reaching thousands of miles per hour. However, from the perspective of a viewer on the ground, the shuttle appears to be moving relatively slowly because it is so far away. \nImagine standing on a highway and watching a car driving down the road. The car might be going very fast, but if it is far away from you, it will appear to be moving slowly. The same is true for a space shuttle. Even though it is moving at high speeds, it is so far away that it appears to be moving slowly. \nAnother reason the shuttle might appear to be moving slowly is because it is so large. The size of the shuttle can make it appear as though it is moving more slowly than it actually is. \nOverall, the appearance of a space shuttle moving slowly during launch is an optical illusion caused by the distance between the viewer and the shuttle, as well as the size of the shuttle itself.",

Previously , you could pour molten metal into open faced circular molds . Three dimensional shapes ( such as cubes ) could not as easily be punched out or cast . Meanwhile , anything with sharp corners will tend to have those corners beat up rather quickly . So squares are out , those nice distinct corners would get damaged really quickly .

    "answer": "The shape of coins and other forms of currency is largely a matter of tradition and practicality. Coins have been used as a form of currency for thousands of years, and over time, certain shapes have become standard. \nOne reason that round coins are so common is that they are easy to make using simple tools. It is relatively simple to cut a round coin out of a flat sheet of metal, and the coin can be easily rolled if it needs to be transported. In contrast, it would be much more difficult to cut a cube or a sphere out of metal using basic tools. \nAnother reason that round coins are so common is that they are easy to stack and store. If you have a pile of round coins, they will naturally fit together in a way that makes it easy to count them and keep track of how much money you have. Coins of other shapes might not stack as easily, which could make them more difficult to use. \nIn summary, round coins are common because they are easy to make, easy to transport, and easy to store. While it is possible that currency could be made in other shapes, round coins have become the standard due to their practicality and longstanding tradition.",

Identical twins come from a single fertilized egg that splits into two embryos, so they have the same genetic makeup. However, the baby will also inherit traits from its mother and father, which will contribute to its unique appearance.

    "answer": "It's not uncommon for dogs to spin around a few times before settling down to rest. Some dogs do this as a way to create a comfortable spot for themselves to lie down, while others may do it as a way to mark their territory or as a way to express excitement or joy. It's possible that your dog's spinning behavior is a combination of these factors, or it could be something else entirely. \nOne theory is that dogs spin around before lying down as a way to create a comfortable spot for themselves to rest. Dogs have a natural instinct to create a den or a safe place for themselves, and spinning around may be a way for them to do this. When a dog spins around, they may be creating a depression in the ground or flattening grass or other debris, which can make a more comfortable spot for them to lie down. \nAnother theory is that dogs spin around as a way to mark their territory. Dogs have scent glands in their paws, and when they spin around, they may be leaving their scent on the ground as a way to mark their territory. This behavior is especially common in male dogs, who may spin around as a way to show other dogs that the area is theirs. \nFinally, it's possible that your dog spins around as a way to express excitement or joy. Dogs are social animals, and they often show their happiness through physical behavior like spinning, wagging their tail, and jumping. If your dog is spinning around before lying down, it could be a sign that they are happy and content. \nOverall, the reason why dogs spin around before lying down is not fully understood, and it may vary from dog to dog. Some dogs do it more than others, and it could be due to a combination of different factors.",

In other words, the high school is not selling merchandise with the team's logo on it or using the logo to promote a product or service. \nAdditionally, the high schools may have obtained permission from the team or the National Football League (NFL) to use the logo. It is not uncommon for high schools to reach out to professional sports teams and ask for permission to use their logo or mascot as a way to show support for the team and create a sense of school spirit. \nOverall, it is important to remember that professional sports teams own the rights to their logos and can take legal action if they feel that someone is using their logo without permission or in a way that could damage the team's reputation. However, as long as the high school is using the logo in a respectful and non-commercial way, it is generally allowed.",

    "question": "Why do people become outraged and upset at other people 's sexual preferences ? If nobody 's getting hurt or coerced , why do people get so bent out of shape about what other folks do in the bedroom ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "My theory is this : we humans have found the need to become self - controlled and disciplined for the good of our society . We keep our basic instincts in check so that we can focus on working together to build things and to make our lives better and free of danger . Obviously most of us like sex ... but we also do n't have sex anywhere , anytime we want . Society expects us to deal with our basic instincts in privacy . Those who can not do this are frowned upon because it shows a lack of self - control , a personality flaw that is seen as harmful to the well - being of our society . However , heterosexuality is more widely accepted ( or tolerated ) because it 's essential to life - that 's basically how you make babies . If you 're alive right now , chances are that your biological parents did the nasty at least once before . Homosexuality on the other hand is n't as widespread as heterosexuality so many people have trouble relating to it . They do n't understand its appeal . Because of that and because it does n't follow \" the norm \" , some people see homosexuality as a personality flaw , as the result of someone not being able to take control of their urges . It also does n't help that some gay people are extremely vocal about their sexual preference and may be attracted to heterosexual people , something which is n't reciprocated and can be the source of discomfort . In my opinion , the reason why some idiots are outraged about what gay people do in their own home is because they think their supposed \" lack of self - control \" is going to have a negative effect somewhere else in society .",

    "answer": "Standoffs are used to physically separate the motherboard from the case of a computer. This separation is important for a number of reasons. \nFirst, the motherboard and the case are made of different materials, and they can have different electrical charges. If the motherboard is in contact with the case, these charges can flow between the two, causing a short circuit. Standoffs help to prevent this by providing a physical barrier between the motherboard and the case. \nSecond, standoffs help to support the motherboard and keep it level within the case. This can help to prevent the motherboard from bending or warping due to the weight of the components that are attached to it. \nFinally, standoffs also help to provide airflow within the case by creating space between the motherboard and the case. This can help to keep the components on the motherboard cooler, which can help to extend their lifespan. \nIn short, standoffs are an important component of a computer case because they help to protect the motherboard from damage, support it, and improve airflow.",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why English dubs of foreign films can sometimes be perceived as comically atrocious. One reason is that it can be difficult to match the lip movements of the actors in the original version of the film with the English dialogue. This can lead to situations where the characters' mouths are moving in a way that doesn't match up with the words being spoken in the English version, which can be distracting for viewers. \nAnother reason is that it can be challenging to find voice actors who are able to effectively convey the emotions and intentions of the characters in the original version of the film. This is especially true if the foreign film uses a lot of nonverbal communication, such as facial expressions and body language, to convey meaning. \nFinally, the quality of the English dub may also be affected by the translation of the original dialogue into English. It can be difficult to accurately convey the nuances and subtleties of the original language in another language, and this can lead to dialogue that feels awkward or unnatural. \nOverall, while there are certainly some well-done English dubs of foreign films out there, it is not uncommon for English dubs to be perceived as inferior to the original versions of the films.",

    "answer": "Predictive texting is a feature on some phones and other devices that tries to anticipate what word you are trying to type and suggests words that might fit. It does this by analyzing patterns in the words you have typed in the past and using those patterns to make suggestions for the current word. \nThere are a few reasons why your phone might be correcting \"hell\" to \"he'll\" but not correcting \"s\" to \"a\": \n1. The predictive texting algorithm may have learned that you frequently type \"he'll\" and therefore suggests it more often. \n2. \"He'll\" is a more common word than \"hell,\" so the algorithm might be more likely to suggest it because it is a more likely choice. \n3. The algorithm might be programmed to prioritize correcting common spelling mistakes over correcting less common ones. In this case, \"s\" instead of \"a\" might be considered a less common mistake, so the algorithm doesn't correct it as frequently. \nIt's important to note that predictive texting algorithms are not perfect and can sometimes make mistakes or suggest words that don't make sense. If you don't want the algorithm to make suggestions, you can usually turn off the predictive texting feature in your phone's settings.",

    "question": "What was the incentive behind the terrorist attack in Canada ? Sorry i m a bit out of the loop . From the UK , been away for the week and come back to this news . Do they know who did the shooting and why ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information about a recent terrorist attack in Canada. It's possible that you may be mistaken or that you are referring to an event that has not yet occurred. It's important to remember that terrorism is a serious and destructive crime that is often motivated by hate, ideology, or political goals. The perpetrators of terrorist attacks often seek to spread fear and destabilize communities and societies. It is important to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious activity to the authorities. However, it's also important to remember that the vast majority of people in the world are kind, decent, and law-abiding, and that acts of terrorism are rare and do not reflect the values or beliefs of the vast majority of people.",

    "question": "What is the psychology behind why women stay with the man who beats them ? What 's the point ? ! This question applies to any women ( married or single ) . Thanks ahead of time Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "I think it might help for you to try seeing this from a more sympathetic POV rather than as a case study . This is a partial list made of the reasons people give for staying with an abusive partner , from a blog of someone who was in an abusive relationship herself , and talked to others in the same situation . The entire list is too long to post in one comment , so I 've put the titles here , but omitted the examples / explanations for the ones that are easier to understand . [ Here 's the link to her original full writing with examples for each reason here . ] ( URL_0 ) 1 . * * \" I do n't want to die . \" * * Her husband has told her that if she leaves he will kill her , and she believes this . ( She may well be right . ) The instant he gets a whiff of where she 's staying -- and he probably will , at some point , from a well - meaning friend or through the legal system or by persistent stalking or random chance -- he 's going to come there and he 's going to do something very , very bad to her . Staying with him may be horrible , but at least she gets to live . She believes that if she leaves , no one and nothing can protect her from his vengeance . 2 . * * \" I 'll die without her . \" * * He lives in his girlfriend 's apartment . He 's unemployed , or minimally employed , and has no education or good experience on his resume . He has no friends besides her . He 's gotten to the point where he does n't know how he 'll get food without her help , much less navigate all the challenges of life . And if he leaves her , he 'll be leaving everything -- she'll destroy any of his stuff that he leaves behind , stalk him so he ca n't stay at the same job , and even kill his pets . If he leaves her , he 's certain that he 'll end up living on the streets . 3 . * * \" He 'll die without me . \" * * 4 . * * \" What about the kids ? \" * * Right now , she protects the kids from her husband . He may rage at her , but she shelters them from the worst of it and she makes sure they have the best home she can give them under the circumstances . If she leaves , she doubts she can get sole custody of the kids without visitation , much less get it immediately . And if the kids are alone with him , something very bad will happen . He 'll hurt them , or turn them against her , or take them away and she 'll never see them again . Maybe all three . Her kids are her life and she ca n't bear to let something like that happen . 5 . * * \" I tried once , and it made things worse . \" * * This is n't the first time . He did call the cops on his husband before , and he ran away that night . The cops did n't find enough evidence , and when he came back to get his stuff , his husband was ... tearfully apologetic , actually . Somehow he talked him into staying and not taking his stuff . The punishment came later -- once he 'd more or less committed to staying around -- and it was horrible . But he 's afraid that if he tried to leave again , he 'd go through the same cycle again . 6 . * * \" I reached out once , and was rebuffed . \" * * In a rare moment of courage , he -- with shaking hands , summoning all his strength -- told someone he thought he could trust what his wife was doing to him . They told him to think about her point of view for once , to not use big drastic words like \" abuse , \" and to take care of his own damn problems without airing his dirty laundry . He just knows that if he reaches out again , it 's going to be the same thing . He 's lucky she did n't find out about that time and doubts if it 's worth taking the risk again . 7 . * * \" If I call the cops , I 'll be in trouble . \" * * She 's a prostitute . On the side , she sells drugs . She owns guns she should n't have and lives in a place she should n't be . Hell , she should n't even be in this country . Her lifestyle is so far outside the law that any attention from the police is likely to get her thrown in jail -- so she ca n't very well tell the police that her girlfriend beats her . 8 . * * \" Run away ? Call the cops ? I ca n't even get away with sneezing ! \" * * 9 . * * \" If it were so bad , someone would have done something . \" * * Everyone knows what 's going on in his life . His friends have seen his girlfriend hitting him ; his parents have heard him say \" I ca n't do that , she wo n't let me \" about a million things ; the neighbors have heard the screams and crashes when she explodes . He knows everyone knows already , and knows that they have n't done anything even though they know . So , he figures , what difference would it make to tell them ? Clearly they 've already decided that this is n't bad enough to call in the authorities over . 10 . * * \" It 's a joke to him , so it should be a joke to me . \" * * 11 . * * \" I 'm just terrified to hurt her feelings . \" * * Abuse has made her telepathic . Years of desperately trying to keep her girlfriend happy so bad things wo n't happen have made her keenly aware of her girlfriend 's every fleeting emotion . Her girlfriend is a tiny bit moody and she rushes to coddle and comfort her ; her girlfriend is a tiny bit happy and she just about throws a party for her . She 's so used to reading her girlfriend 's feelings and translating them into her own that she ca n't stand to do something that would really hurt her girlfriend 's feelings . Just the thought of dealing with that much anger -- when even a tiny amount of anger is a big deal in their house -- is too terrifying to imagine . 12 . * * \" I 'm so embarrassed I let him do this to me . \" * * 13 . * * \" I 've learned to live in her system . \" * * He knows all the rules by now . As long as he always treats his wife with the utmost politeness and gentleness , and always has dinner ready before she comes home , always is up for sex when she wants it , and always lets her make the decisions , things are okay . He actually feels pretty safe when he 's being \" good . \" So it does n't seem like there 's anything wrong with the relationship , because it goes great so long as he does as he 's supposed to . 14 . * * \" We 're outsiders ; no one cares about our problems . \" * * They 're a lesbian couple , one of them is transgendered , and they 're kinky to boot . She 's had enough problems just explaining to the \" authorities \" that their relationship exists ; how the hell is she supposed to convey that there 's something wrong with it ? She 's internalized enough prejudice that she figures it 's sort of her own fault for being in such a strange relationship , and she does n't figure anyone cares that much about the troubles of a weirdo . 15 . * * \" After all he 's done for a jerk like me ? \" * * Her husband has put up with so much from her . This is n't # 13 ; these were genuinely bad things . He helped her pay off the nasty credit card debt she was in . He stayed with her even after she got fired from her job and flunked out of school ; he even bailed her out of jail when she really fucked up . Who could blame the guy if he loses his patience now and then ? She figures she really is a very difficult person to live with , she deserves some punishment for all she 's screwed up , and she should be grateful that he 's kept her around at all . As he reminds her when she 's pushed him too far -- who else would love her ? 16 . * * \" She 's really nice ... mostly . \" * * Her wife is super sweet and loving . She 's a flowers - and - chocolates romantic , a believer in true love and love at first sight , and she treats her just like a princess . Except now and then , things get tense in the relationship , and bad things happen . Really bad things . Her wife just does n't seem like herself and she explodes . But the apology is even sweeter and lovinger than before and things are good again . Maybe it was a one - off . Or a two - off . A three - off ? Maybe this really is the last time and from now on she 'll just have the nice wife she fell in love with . She 's certainly being nice now , and how could you leave someone like that ? 17 . * * \" It just is n't done in our community . \" * * 18 . * * \" Actually , I 'm abusing her . \" * * When she explodes , she does n't tell her boyfriend \" I hate you ; \" she tells him \" you hate me . \" She tells him that he 's hurting her , that she 's responding the way she is because she just ca n't take his abuse any more , and he believes her . He 's trying desperately to treat her right , to treat her the way she deserves , and he just keeps fucking up . Often when she 's yelling he yells back -- sometimes he even hits back -- and that makes him more sure than ever that he 's the real abuser here . 19 . * * \" It 's not that bad . \" * * She firmly believes that real abuse is when they punch you -- and her husband 's only slapped her with an open hand . Real abuse is when they beat you -- and he only yells at her until she cries and then yells at her to stop crying . Real abuse is when they rape you -- and he always makes her say \" yes \" before he has sex with her , no matter how little she wants it . She recognizes there 's something wrong in their relationship , but could never call it like , abuse abuse , and so she ca n't react to it like it 's real abuse . 20 . * * \" This is how relationships work , is n't it ? \" * * Her parents ' relationship was a constant cycle of drama and violence . Her relationship with her parents was just as bad . Her high school boyfriend hit her and her college boyfriend made her have sex when she did n't want it . She kinda figures everyone else 's relationship is just the same behind the scenes . All she worries about is how to make the best of an abusive relationship ; while she knows it intellectually , she does n't believe deep down that a non - abusive relationship is possible , at least for her .",

    "question": "What is the psychology behind why women stay with the man who beats them ? What 's the point ? ! This question applies to any women ( married or single ) . Thanks ahead of time Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "It's not okay for anyone to be physically or emotionally abusive towards someone they are in a relationship with. Unfortunately, many people who experience abuse in their relationships stay with their abuser for a variety of reasons. Here are a few potential reasons why someone might stay in an abusive relationship: \n1. Fear: Some people stay in abusive relationships because they are afraid of what might happen if they leave. They might be afraid of retribution from their abuser, or they might be afraid of being alone and not having anyone to turn to for support. \n2. Love: Despite the abuse, some people might still love their partner and believe that they can change or that the abuse is a one-time occurrence. \n3. Lack of resources: Some people might feel like they don't have the financial or emotional resources to leave an abusive relationship. They might not have a place to go or the means to support themselves. \n4. Isolation: Abusers often try to isolate their victims from their friends and family, which can make it harder for the victim to leave. They might not have anyone to turn to for help or support. \n5. Hope: Some people might stay in an abusive relationship because they hope that things will get better. They might believe that their abuser will change or that the abuse was a one-time thing. \nIt's important to remember that no one deserves to be treated poorly or to be in an abusive relationship. If you or someone you know is experiencing abuse, it's important to reach out for help and support. There are resources available to help you leave an abusive relationship and to get the support you need to stay safe.",

    "question": "Are men who get a sex change and become women able to retire earlier ? In the UK , at least up until recently , women and men retired at different ages . What would happen here ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "In the United Kingdom, men and women used to be able to retire at different ages, but this is no longer the case. The retirement age for both men and women is now 66, and it is set to increase to 67 in the near future. \nThis means that if a man gets a sex change and becomes a woman, they will be able to retire at the same age as any other woman. The same is true for a woman who gets a sex change and becomes a man. The retirement age is based on a person's age and not their gender, so it does not matter whether a person is a man or a woman when it comes to retiring. \nI hope this helps to clarify things!

    "answer": "The currency symbol is on the left to prevent modifying checks and ledgers in old - style , paper - only record keeping . If you 're keeping the books for a business , and write down that you paid out \" 10 $ \" to another business for supplies , an unscrupulous business partner could steal a bunch of money , and then modify the ledger to say that you paid \" 110 $ \" by simply tacking a 1 to the front of the number , thus hiding the fact that they 're skimming money .

    "question": "Why do we use the \u00a3 /$ symbol before the number but we say it the other way round ? E.G.\u00a310 we would say 10 pounds not pounds 10 Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The symbol for pounds (\u00a3) or dollars ($) is called a currency symbol, and it is used to represent a specific type of money. The symbol is placed in front of the number to indicate the value of the amount being discussed. For example, if you see the symbol \u00a3 in front of a number, it means that the number represents a value in pounds. \nWhen we say the amount out loud, we usually say the number first, followed by the name of the currency. For example, if you see the amount \u00a310, you would say \"ten pounds.\" This is because we usually say numbers before other words, just like we say a person's name before their last name. \nSo, the reason we use the currency symbol before the number and say the number before the currency name is just a convention, or a way that we have agreed to do things. It helps to make it clear what we are talking about and makes it easier for everyone to understand.",

It's possible that the perception of marijuana as \"less cool\" among teens could be one factor contributing to the decrease in use. Other possible factors could include increased education and awareness about the potential risks and negative effects of marijuana use, stricter laws and enforcement related to the sale and possession of marijuana to minors, and the availability of alternative substances or activities that may be perceived as more appealing to teens.",

    "answer": "In general, it is not considered animal cruelty to kill insects because insects are not considered to have the same capacity for suffering as animals like mammals and birds. This is because insects do not have the same level of brain development and consciousness as these animals. However, it is still important to be mindful of and respectful towards all living creatures, including insects, and to avoid causing unnecessary suffering.

    "question": "If I find an undiscovered island in international waters , is it mine ? What exactly would be its legal status ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "If you find an undiscovered island in international waters, it does not automatically become yours. International waters are not owned by any particular country, so the island would not belong to you just because you found it. Instead, the legal status of the island would depend on what country has the strongest claim to it. \nTo make a claim to an island, a country must be able to show that it has exercised effective control over the island for a long period of time. This might include things like building settlements, planting flags, or using the island for military purposes. If a country can prove that it has exercised effective control over an island, it may be able to claim ownership of the island under international law. \nIn order to determine the legal status of an undiscovered island, it would be necessary to investigate the history of the island and see if any countries have a strong claim to it. If no country has a strong claim to the island, it may be possible for the island to become part of the territory of the country that first discovers it and establishes effective control over it. However, this would have to be determined by international law and would likely involve negotiations with other countries.",

    "answer": "Human beings are social animals and we have developed certain cultural norms and behaviors that help us interact with one another. One of these norms is the idea of modesty, or the idea that certain parts of the body should be covered up or kept private. This idea of modesty can vary from culture to culture, but it is generally based on the belief that it is important to maintain a sense of decorum and respect in social situations. \nIn many cultures, the private parts of the body, such as the genitalia and buttocks, are considered private and are therefore typically covered up in public. This is often done for reasons of hygiene and to prevent the spread of disease, as well as to maintain a sense of dignity and respect. Covering up these parts of the body can also help to prevent unwanted attention or advances from others. \nOverall, the idea of modesty and covering up private parts is a social norm that has developed over time and is meant to help us interact with one another in a respectful and appropriate way.",

    "answer": "Simply put , a commissioned officer has his rank by act of Congress . A Non - Commissioned Officer does not . They are distinct rank structures , but the question is really , \" What is the difference between Officer & Enlisted ? \" more than Commissioned ( Officer ) & NCO ( Enlisted ) . Enlisted in the US ( Army ) have paygrades of E-1 ( Private ) through E-9 ( Sergeant Major ) while Officers have paygrades of O-1 ( Lieutenant ) through O-11 ( 5 Star General ) . Commissioned Officers Begin at O-1 , however NCO 's begin at E-4 / E-5 ( Corporal / Sergeant ) depending on specialty , and service . The term ' Officer ' implies Leadership , or more specifically Supervisory or Managerial role of some type , even if it is just a general concept , such as ' leader of soldiers . ' A E-4 will generally be responsible for 4~ people ( a team ) , whereas a Lieutenant will be responsible for 30 - 40 ( a Platoon ) . However there is lots of other things that take place . Lieutenants are usually ' young ' ( college graduates , but still early - id 20s ) , so they are paired with experienced NCO 's E6 - 7s who are able to balance things out . This works out very well . This philosophy extends up the chain of command as well . There is a ' Senior enlisted adviser ' paired with almost every commander . Keep in mind that there is far fewer Commissioned officers than there are Enlisted ( the ratio is probably less than 20:1 overall , if not closer to 50:1 )",

    "question": "How exactly does a bite from a venomous spider kill you ? What exactly is going on on a biological and/or chemical level ? Is there more than one way it kills you ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "When a venomous spider bites you, it injects a type of poison called venom into your body. The venom can cause different effects, depending on the type of spider and the amount of venom injected. Some venomous spider bites can cause only mild symptoms, while others can be very serious and even life-threatening. \nOne way that venom from a spider bite can kill you is by causing your blood pressure to drop very low, which can lead to shock and organ failure. This can happen if the venom causes your blood vessels to become dilated, or widened, so that your blood does not flow as strongly as it should. This can lead to a lack of oxygen getting to your organs and tissues, which can cause them to become damaged or stop working properly. \nAnother way that venom from a spider bite can kill you is by causing your body to have an allergic reaction to the venom. An allergic reaction is when your immune system overreacts to something it perceives as a threat, such as venom from a spider bite. This can cause a range of symptoms, including swelling, difficulty breathing, and shock. \nThere are many other ways that venom from a spider bite can affect your body and cause serious health problems, depending on the type of venom and the amount that was injected. It is important to seek medical attention right away if you think you have been bitten by a venomous spider, so that you can receive treatment to help prevent serious health problems or death.",

    "answer": "Sure! Here is a simple explanation of how college works in the United States: \n1. First, you have to decide what you want to study in college. This is called your \"major.\" There are many different majors to choose from, such as biology, engineering, business, or art. \n2. Next, you have to find a college or university that offers the major you want to study. There are many different colleges and universities to choose from, and they are located all over the country. Some are big and some are small, and they all have different programs and features. \n3. Once you have found a college or university that you like, you have to apply to go there. This involves filling out a form called the \"application,\" which asks for your personal information and your grades from high school. You might also have to write an essay and ask for letters of recommendation from your teachers or other people who know you. \n4. After you have applied to a college, you have to wait to see if you are accepted. This is called the \"admission\" process. The college will look at your application and decide if they think you will be a good fit for their school. If you are accepted, congratulations! You are going to college! \n5. Once you are accepted to a college, you have to pay for it. College is not free, and you have to pay for your classes, books, and other things. There are many ways to pay for college, such as scholarships, grants, and loans. \n6. After you have paid for college, you are ready to start! You will attend classes, do homework, and participate in activities. You will also meet new people and make new friends. \n7. After you have completed your studies and graduated from college, you will be ready to find a job. You can use the skills and knowledge you gained in college to get a job in your chosen field. \nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

    "answer": "If a lawyer lets slip that their client is guilty, either intentionally or not, it could have serious consequences. This is because a lawyer's primary duty is to defend their client's interests and protect their rights. If a lawyer reveals that their client is guilty, they may be violating their duty of confidentiality, which is a legal obligation to keep information shared by a client private. This could lead to the lawyer facing disciplinary action, such as being disbarred or losing their license to practice law. Additionally, the lawyer's revelation could be used as evidence against their client in court and could potentially harm their case. It is important for lawyers to maintain confidentiality and protect their client's interests at all times, even if their client is guilty.",

    "question": "- Has the Affordable Care Act really been beneficial to Americans ? If so , how ? Sorry if this seems like a silly question . I really do n't know much about it . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "I ca n't speak on Americans as a whole , but for me , it 's been a nightmare . I did n't have health insurance before this went into effect . On the very very rare occasion I needed to visit the ER , I used uncompensated care . My job does n't provide me with any option for health insurance and private insurance is too expensive . Once the ACA went into effect , I tried to sign up for Medicaid , but was told I make too much money ( which is funny to me seeing as I live paycheck to paycheck in a crackerbox apartment and often have to choose which bill to pay and which to let go late ) , and when I looked into my options , it cost way too much for me to afford . Now I do n't have insurance like before , only now I 'm going to get a $ 175 fine because I 'm poor . I ca n't imagine I 'm the only person going through this or similar problems . To me , this whole law is a load of crap .

    "question": "- Has the Affordable Care Act really been beneficial to Americans ? If so , how ? Sorry if this seems like a silly question . I really do n't know much about it . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, is a healthcare reform law that was passed in the United States in 2010. The main goal of the ACA was to make healthcare more affordable and accessible for Americans. \nHere are some ways that the ACA has been beneficial to Americans: \n1. Expanded coverage: The ACA expanded Medicaid (a government healthcare program for low-income individuals and families) to more people, and it also created new options for Americans to purchase private health insurance through Health Insurance Marketplaces. \n2. Reduced uninsured rate: Before the ACA, many Americans did not have health insurance because it was too expensive or because they were unable to get coverage due to pre-existing medical conditions. The ACA made it easier for people to get health insurance, and as a result, the uninsured rate in the United States has decreased significantly. \n3. Protections for people with pre-existing conditions: The ACA made it illegal for insurance companies to deny coverage or charge higher premiums to people because of pre-existing medical conditions. This has been especially beneficial for people who have chronic illnesses or disabilities. \n4. Cost savings: The ACA has also helped to reduce healthcare costs for many Americans by requiring insurance companies to cover certain preventive services (such as vaccines and screenings) at no extra cost to the patient. This helps to catch and treat medical problems before they become more serious and expensive to treat. \nOverall, the ACA has made it easier for Americans to get health insurance and has helped to improve the quality and affordability of healthcare in the United States.",

    "question": "What would happen if a syringe of water was injected into your veins ? Say you were prepping for surgery , what would happen if instead of anaesthetic , you were injected with water , in both small quantities and say a syringe full or more ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "If plain water were injected into a vein it would dilute the contents of the plasma ( mainly electrolytes like sodium and chloride , and proteins ) in that local area . Through a process called osmosis a portion of the water would fairly rapidly be drawn into nearby cells , in particular the red blood cells . Many of these cells would expand in volume rapidly to the point that their cell membranes would rupture , spilling their contents into the circulation . For a very small amount of water there would be no lasting harm . As the amount increases more red cells would be damaged . The harm from this falls into two categories - as you lose red blood cells , your blood is less able to carry oxygen to other parts of the body , and the substances leaking from the injured cells would in large enough quantities cause harm themselves since the balance of what is kept inside and outside of these cells is delicate and well regulated . If , instead of plain water , water with solutes in roughly the same concentration as the plasma was introduced ( such as \" normal saline \" ) , and the quantities were not ridiculous , then it would simply become part of your circulating blood volume . Over time the extra fluid would end up dividing between your circulating blood volume , the insides of various cells , and the fluid that surrounds cells in your body outside of the circulation . This scenario is common - for example , small volumes of saline are usually used to flush medications given through an intravenous line in order to make sure all of it enters the blood at the time it was intended to be given .",

    "answer": "If a syringe of water were injected into your veins, it would not be harmful in small quantities. However, injecting a large amount of water into your veins can be dangerous because it can cause your blood cells to become diluted. This can lead to a condition called hyponatremia, which occurs when the sodium levels in your blood become too low. Symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, nausea, vomiting, seizures, and even coma or death in severe cases. It is important to always follow your doctor's instructions and use medications as directed to avoid any potential harm.",

    "answer": "Dreams are a product of the brain and they don't follow the same rules as the real world. In dreams, anything can happen and time can pass differently than it does in the real world. So, it's not surprising that dreams might not always end at what we consider to be \"appropriate\" times. \nSometimes, our brains will end a dream because it's no longer interesting or because the dreamer is about to wake up. Other times, the dream might end in a way that feels like it makes sense in the context of the dream. For example, if you're dreaming about falling from a building, your brain might end the dream just before you hit the ground because that's a natural stopping point for that particular dream. \nIt's important to remember that dreams are just a normal part of the sleep cycle and they don't necessarily have any deeper meaning. They're just a way for our brains to process information and sort through our thoughts and experiences while we sleep.",

    "answer": "I 've asked this question here before and have yet to find a suitable answer . Edit : Did google search . The following is courtesy of Mental_Floss . The most plausible one , espoused by a number of scientists who are n't this guy , is that the shiver is a result of two parts of the autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) getting their streams crossed . The ANS is a control system for involuntary muscles affects things like heart and respiration rates , digestion , body temperature control and urination . The ANS has two divisions . The sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) controls bladder function , among other things . It keeps the bladder relaxed and the urethral sphincter contracted so you do n't have to concentrate on not peeing your pants all day . The parasympathetic nervous system ( PNS ) relaxes the urethral sphincter and contracts the bladder when you decide to answer nature 's call . Part of the SNS response to a full bladder is the release of chemicals like catecholamines ( which include epinephrine , norepinephrine and dopamine ) . When you finally grab a minute to urinate , the PNS takes over , and catecholamine production changes . Some sources point at the change in chemical production as the cause of the shiver , and others say it 's the SNS to PNS switch itself that does it .",

    "question": "why do you get the pee shivers , and what 's going on to make your body do that ? Pee shivers . What 's the deal ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Pee shivers, also known as \"pee goosebumps\" or \"pee chills,\" are a sensation that some people experience when they urinate. They are caused by a reflex in the body called the \"micturition reflex,\" which is responsible for causing the muscles in the bladder to contract and release urine. \nWhen you start to urinate, your body sends a signal to your brain to relax the muscles in your bladder. At the same time, the muscles around your urethra (the tube that carries urine out of your body) contract to help control the flow of urine. As the urine flows out of your body, it may cause a feeling of coldness or wetness on your skin, which can trigger the micturition reflex. \nThe micturition reflex causes the muscles in your body to contract and release in a series of rapid, involuntary movements. This can cause the sensation of pee shivers, which may feel like a series of shivers or goosebumps. \nPee shivers are completely normal and are nothing to worry about. They may be more common in some people than others, and they can occur at any age. If you are experiencing pee shivers frequently or if they are causing you discomfort, you may want to talk to a healthcare provider for further evaluation.",

    "answer": "If Apple went out of business, it would depend on how you have stored your songs, pictures, and other personal data. If you have saved your personal data on your device, such as your iPhone or Mac, then you would still be able to access your data as long as your device is working properly. However, if you have been using iCloud or other cloud storage services offered by Apple to store your data, then you would no longer be able to access your data through those services if Apple goes out of business. \nOne way to ensure that you can continue to access your personal data even if a company goes out of business is to make sure to regularly back up your data to an external hard drive or to a different cloud storage service. This way, you will have a copy of your data that you can access even if the original service is no longer available. \nIt's also important to remember that it is highly unlikely that Apple would go out of business completely, as it is a very successful and well-established company. However, it is always a good idea to be prepared for any eventuality and to take steps to protect your personal data.",

    "answer": "Crying is a natural response that humans and some other animals have to certain emotions, such as sadness, happiness, or pain. When we feel strong emotions, our bodies can produce chemicals called hormones. These hormones can cause physical reactions in our bodies, such as an increase in heart rate or a change in breathing. They can also cause certain glands in our body, such as the tear glands in our eyes, to produce more fluids. \nWhen we cry, our tear glands produce tears, which are a combination of water, oil, and other substances. These tears are then released from our eyes and travel down our cheeks. Crying can be a way for our bodies to release some of the extra fluids and hormones that are produced when we feel strong emotions. It can also be a way for us to express and communicate those emotions to others.",

    "answer": "Tables often have uneven legs because the floor they are placed on is not completely flat. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as the floor being slightly uneven due to the building settling over time, or because the floor is made of materials that are not perfectly smooth. \nTo fix this problem, people sometimes put folded up pieces of paper or other small objects under the shorter leg of the table to make it level. This helps to ensure that the table is stable and doesn't wobble or tip over. \nThink of it like this: if you were trying to balance a ball on top of a flat surface, but the surface was slightly bumpy, you might need to put a small object under one side of the ball to keep it from rolling off. It's the same idea with a table and its legs \u2013 if one leg is shorter than the others, you can use a small object to raise it up and make the table level.",

    "answer": "Dogs may go in circles before they poop for a few different reasons. Here are a few possibilities: \n1. They may be trying to find the perfect spot to do their business. Dogs often prefer to poop on grass or in a certain area of the yard, so they may circle around to find the best spot. \n2. They may be marking their territory. When dogs circle before they poop, they may be using their scent glands to mark their territory. This is especially common in male dogs. \n3. They may be trying to align their bodies with the Earth's magnetic field. Some researchers believe that dogs, as well as other animals, may use the Earth's magnetic field to orient themselves and find the best spot to poop. \nOverall, it's not uncommon for dogs to circle around before they poop, and it's usually just a normal behavior that doesn't indicate any underlying health problems.",

    "question": "Why did languages start to gender words , especially categorizing most objects as male or female ? This came up in a recent discussion amongst a few English professors , none satisfied with they could come up with . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "It 's not known , but there is some speculation . Essentially , the various grammatical markers that indicate grammatical gender may be ultimately derived from the language 's words for \" man \" and \" woman \" , or \" he \" and \" she \" , for example , originally only used for people , then all animals . This then became a way to categorize other nouns as well . Somtimes , the connection is not too hard to understand . For example , in ancient societies there were gods and goddesses associated with all sorts of things . The sun might be seen as having male qualities -- it 's strong at any rate -- and so to the Romans , Sol , the sun - deity , was clearly a male god , which is why , for example , the French word for \" the sun \" , \" le soleil \" , is masculine ; the moon , on the other hand , being much more gentle , was ruled by a goddess , Luna , hence the French word for \" the moon \" , \" la lune \" , which is feminine . Another way of assigning grammatical gender is by the form of the word itself . Once you have established a list of masculine words and a list of feminine words , you might notice that masculine words follow a certain pattern , while feminine words follow a different pattern . So you allocate new words a gender depending on whether they follow a typical \" masculine \" pattern or a typical \" feminine \" pattern . In Russian , for example , words ending in a consonant are usually masculine , words ending in \" -a \" or \" -ya \" are usually feminine , and words ending in \" -o \" are usually neuter . This explains the famous example of the German word for \" girl \" being neuter . The German word referred to is \" M\u00e4dchen \" . This comes from the ( now old - fashioned ) word \" Magd \" , which is feminine and means \" maid \" . The \" -chen \" ending is what 's called a diminutive , and translates as \" little \" -- so \" M\u00e4dchen \" means \" little maid \" , and is where we get our word \" maiden \" . But in German , all words with diminutive endings are automatically neuter , no matter what they refer to . By this stage , of course , grammatical gender is a completely different concept from actual gender or sex , and is really just a classification system and no longer an indication of whether something is male or female . English has now come full circle , and we use \" natural gender \" , meaning that women and female animals are feminine , men and male animals are masculine , and inanimate objects are neuter . There are some exceptions ; for example , ships are often referred to as \" she \" , probably because the crew depends on her to keep them alive and safe , but she can be difficult to control ( these are stereotypical female qualities , of course ) .",

    "question": "Why did languages start to gender words , especially categorizing most objects as male or female ? This came up in a recent discussion amongst a few English professors , none satisfied with they could come up with . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "In many languages, including English, words for objects, animals, and other nouns are not inherently male or female. Instead, the gender of a noun is often assigned based on the gender of the person or being to which the noun refers. For example, the word \"girl\" refers to a female person, so in English, the word \"girl\" is considered a feminine noun. Similarly, the word \"boy\" refers to a male person, so it is considered a masculine noun in English. \nHowever, not all languages assign gender to nouns in this way. In some languages, the gender of a noun is based on the meaning of the word or its ending. For example, in Spanish, nouns that end in \"-o\" are usually masculine and nouns that end in \"-a\" are usually feminine. \nIt's not entirely clear why some languages have developed systems for assigning gender to nouns, but it is thought that the origins of gendered language may be related to the way that people think about and conceptualize the world around them. Some linguists believe that gendered language may have evolved as a way to categorize and organize the objects and beings in the world in a way that is easier for people to understand and communicate about. \nRegardless of its origins, gendered language is an important feature of many languages and is used in a variety of contexts, including grammar, vocabulary, and even social interactions. While it can be confusing for learners of a new language, understanding and using gendered language is an important part of speaking and writing in many languages around the world.",

    "answer": "The Hubble Space Telescope is a telescope that is launched into space and orbits around Earth. It has a special camera called a \"Wide Field Camera 3\" that takes very detailed pictures of objects in space, including the Milky Way galaxy. \nThe Milky Way is a large group of stars, gas, and dust that is shaped like a disk. It is the galaxy that Earth and the rest of our solar system are a part of. The Hubble Space Telescope takes pictures of the Milky Way by pointing its camera at different parts of the galaxy and taking long exposures, which means it takes a picture for a longer amount of time. This helps the camera capture a lot of light from the stars and other objects in the galaxy, which makes the picture very detailed and clear. \nThe Hubble Space Telescope is able to take pictures of the Milky Way from its orbit around Earth because it is far away from the Earth's atmosphere. The Earth's atmosphere can make it difficult to see objects in space clearly, because it can cause the light from those objects to become distorted. But the Hubble Space Telescope is above the Earth's atmosphere, so it can see objects in space much more clearly. This is why it is able to take such detailed pictures of the Milky Way and other objects in space.",

The amniotic fluid also helps to protect the baby's skin from being damaged or infected while they are developing in the womb. When a baby is born, they are usually covered in a thin layer of a substance called vernix, which helps to protect their skin and keep it moisturized. After birth, the baby's skin will start to dry out a bit, but it should still remain smooth and soft. So, even though a baby has been in the womb for nine months, they are still well-protected and well-hydrated, which helps to keep their skin smooth and wrinkle-free.",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why some societies may be more reserved or modest when it comes to discussing or depicting sexual behavior. One reason is that sex can be a private or personal matter for many people, and some cultures place a high value on privacy and modesty. Additionally, many societies have social norms and taboos around sex that are intended to regulate sexual behavior and protect against certain risks or harms, such as unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections, or exploitation. These norms and taboos may vary from culture to culture, and they may change over time. \nAnother reason why some societies may be more puritanical about sex is that they may have religious or moral values that discourage or prohibit certain types of sexual behavior. For example, some religions view sex as something that should only occur within the context of marriage, and they may consider certain behaviors, such as premarital sex or homosexuality, to be sinful or immoral. \nIt's worth noting that there isn't necessarily an evolutionary or psychological benefit to being puritanical about sex. Different societies have different values and beliefs about what is acceptable or appropriate when it comes to sexual behavior, and these values and beliefs can influence how people think and talk about sex. Ultimately, the way that a society approaches sex is shaped by a variety of factors, including cultural, religious, and social norms.",

    "answer": "Cuban cigars are not illegal in every country, but they are illegal in the United States. The United States has a trade embargo with Cuba, which means that it is against the law to import Cuban cigars (and other Cuban products) into the United States. The trade embargo was put in place in the 1960s to try to pressure the Cuban government to make changes to its policies. \nCuban cigars are known for being high quality, and many people enjoy smoking them. However, because they are illegal in the United States, it is difficult for people in the United States to buy them. If someone in the United States is caught trying to bring Cuban cigars into the country, they could face fines or other legal consequences. \nIt is important to note that there are other countries where Cuban cigars are legal and can be bought and sold freely. So if you are in one of those countries and you want to try a Cuban cigar, you can do so as long as you follow the local laws and regulations.",

    "answer": "A wingman is a friend who helps you try to meet and socialize with new people, especially romantic interests. The idea is that the wingman can help make introductions, start conversations, and generally be supportive and encouraging. The wingman's role is to make you feel more comfortable and confident, not to make you feel awkward. \nFor example, the wingman might introduce you to a woman you're interested in, and then engage in conversation with her friend to give you a chance to talk to the woman you like. The wingman might also make positive comments about you or your interests to the woman you're trying to impress, or help steer the conversation in a direction that makes you look good. \nIt's important to note that the wingman's role is to help, not to take over or dominate the conversation. The ultimate goal is for you to build a connection with the woman you're interested in, not for the wingman to do it for you.",

    "question": "Is it reaaaaaaaaally true that all snowflakes are unique ? There is no fucking way . There are so many snowflakes , man . If it is true , how long would it take to theoretically run out of possible snowflake designs . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Snowflakes are a good example of something called combinatorial explosion . For each place a snowflake could develop differently , the number of possible snowflakes explodes to extremely large values . For a simpler example , let 's say we typed 10 random letters ( ignoring spaces , numbers , and case ) in the standard English alphabet . Say , I choose DIWMLMQWES ( corresponding to one snowflake ) . I 've chosen one of 26 ^ 10 = 141,167,095,653,376 possible strings . But snowflake development is quite complicated , with individual molecules assembling themselves into a lattice .

    "answer": "It is true that no two snowflakes are exactly the same. Snowflakes form when water vapor in the air cools and condenses into ice crystals. As these ice crystals fall through the air, they can pick up additional layers of ice and water vapor, which can cause them to take on a variety of shapes and patterns. The exact shape and pattern of a snowflake is determined by the temperature, humidity, and other conditions in the air as it falls. \nBecause there are so many variables that can affect the shape of a snowflake, it is practically impossible for any two snowflakes to be exactly the same. In fact, it is estimated that there are more possible snowflake shapes than there are atoms in the observable universe, so it is unlikely that we will ever run out of possible snowflake designs.",

    "answer": "NASA retired the Space Shuttle program in 2011 because it had accomplished its goals and was becoming too expensive to maintain. The Space Shuttle was a reusable spacecraft that was used for many different missions, including transporting astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS). It was a very advanced and complex vehicle, but it also had some limitations. \nOne of the reasons NASA decided to use rockets instead of a new upgraded type of Space Shuttle for the Orion spacecraft is that rockets are generally more powerful and can reach higher altitudes and faster speeds than the Space Shuttle. This is important for deep space missions, such as going to the Moon or Mars, because these destinations are much farther away from Earth than the ISS. \nAnother reason is that the Space Shuttle required a lot of maintenance and preparation between flights, which made it less flexible and efficient than rockets. Rockets can be launched more quickly and can be used for a wider range of missions. \nFinally, NASA is always looking for ways to improve and advance its technology, and developing a new type of Space Shuttle would have been a very expensive and time-consuming project. Instead, NASA chose to focus on developing new rockets and spacecraft that are more suited to deep space exploration.",

    "answer": "It 's a variety of things . Shy people can just prefer to not interact much with others , they can be very introverted or just a little introverted , they can be aloof and unconcerned with socialisation , they can be actively against socializing due to antisocial disorders , they can be low - selfesteem , they can have anxiety issues , they can be off in their own world , they can be raised in a culture that encourages stoicism and only speaking when necessary , and so on .

    "answer": "People can be shy for a variety of reasons. Some people may be shy because they are naturally introverted, which means that they tend to feel more comfortable being alone or with a small group of close friends, rather than being in large groups or around new people. Others may be shy because they are anxious about social situations, and may worry about what others think of them or about making mistakes. \nStill others may be shy because of past negative experiences, such as being teased or bullied, which can make them feel self-conscious or afraid of being rejected. Some people may also be shy because of cultural or social norms that discourage them from speaking up or expressing themselves. \nOverall, shyness is a normal and common human emotion, and it's something that many people experience at some point in their lives. It's important to remember that everyone is different and that it's okay to be shy. With time and practice, many people are able to overcome their shyness and become more confident in social situations.",

    "question": "Why do falling oil prices also imply tanked economies ? Would n't falling prices for something so critical mean cheaper everything for everyone ? What am I missing ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Falling oil prices can have both positive and negative effects on an economy. On the positive side, lower oil prices can lead to lower costs for businesses and consumers, which can lead to increased spending and economic growth. For example, if the price of gasoline falls, people may be more likely to take road trips or drive more, which can boost tourism and other industries. \nHowever, falling oil prices can also have negative effects on certain sectors of the economy, particularly those that are heavily dependent on the oil industry. For example, if the price of oil falls, it may be less profitable for oil companies to extract and sell oil, which can lead to layoffs and reduced investment in the industry. This can have a ripple effect, as businesses and workers in other industries that rely on the oil industry, such as transportation and manufacturing, may also be negatively impacted. \nIn summary, falling oil prices can lead to lower costs and increased economic activity in some areas, but they can also lead to economic challenges for industries and communities that rely heavily on the oil industry.",

    "answer": "A .rar file is a type of compressed file, which means that it contains one or more files that have been reduced in size by removing unnecessary information. When you extract a .rar file, the original files are restored to their full size. \nFor example, imagine that you have a folder containing a bunch of large documents. These documents take up a lot of space on your computer, so you want to send them to someone else. Instead of sending the whole folder, you can use a .rar file to compress the documents into a smaller size. Then, you can send the .rar file, which is much smaller than the original folder. \nWhen the person you sent the .rar file to receives it, they can extract it to get the original documents back. This means that the folder that is extracted from the .rar file will be the same size as the original folder, which may be larger than the .rar file itself. \nI hope this helps to explain how .rar files work!

    "answer": "It's true that no two snowflakes are exactly alike, but it's not because some snowflakes are hard to find or observe. Instead, it's because of the way that snowflakes are formed. \nSnowflakes are made of ice crystals, which form in the sky when water vapor turns into a solid. The exact shape and size of a snowflake depends on the temperature and humidity in the air as it falls to the ground. Because these conditions are always changing, it's unlikely that two snowflakes will form under exactly the same conditions and therefore be exactly the same. \nScientists have studied snowflakes for many years, and they have never found two that are exactly the same. While it's possible that two snowflakes could be very similar, it's very unlikely that they would be exactly the same. So while it's not impossible that two snowflakes could be the same, it's very unlikely, and we can say with confidence that no two snowflakes are exactly alike.",

    "answer": "There are a few factors that can make one country's passport more valuable than another's. One factor is the number of countries that the passport holder can visit without needing to get a visa in advance. Passports from countries that have strong diplomatic relationships with many other countries, or that are part of international organizations like the European Union, tend to have more visa-free travel options. This can make it easier and more convenient for the passport holder to travel internationally, which is why these passports are sometimes considered more valuable. \nAnother factor that can make a passport more valuable is the overall reputation and stability of the country. Passports from countries that are seen as safe and well-governed are often more highly valued because they can give the passport holder access to more opportunities and privileges when traveling or living abroad. \nFinally, some passports are considered more valuable because they can provide their holders with certain privileges or benefits, such as access to exclusive clubs or discounts on certain products or services. This is often the case for passports from countries with a high standard of living or a strong economy. \nSo, in general, a \"valuable\" passport is one that allows the holder to travel easily and conveniently, is issued by a stable and well-regarded country, and may offer other privileges or benefits.",

Here are some general guidelines for dressing for different temperature ranges on the Celsius scale: \n0\u00b0C to 10\u00b0C (32\u00b0F to 50\u00b0F): This is a cool temperature range. You'll want to wear a warm coat, gloves, and a hat to keep your head and hands warm. You might also want to wear a scarf or a face mask to protect your face from the cold.\n10\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C (50\u00b0F to 68\u00b0F): This is a mild temperature range. You can still wear a coat, but you might not need to wear as many layers underneath. You might want to wear a sweater or a light jacket, and you might not need to wear gloves or a hat.\n20\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 86\u00b0F): This is a warm temperature range. You can wear lighter clothing, such as a T-shirt and pants or a skirt. You might still want to bring a light jacket or sweater in case it gets cooler in the evening.\n30\u00b0C and above (86\u00b0F and above): This is a hot temperature range.

    "question": "What makes inflation so bad ? Sure everything costs more , but you also make more , so what s wrong ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Inflation is when the general price level of goods and services in an economy increases over time. This means that, in general, the same amount of money will buy you fewer goods and services. So if you have a certain amount of money and prices go up, your money will not go as far as it used to. \nFor example, let's say you have $100 and you want to buy a toy that costs $10. If there is no inflation, you can buy 10 toys with your $100 because 100 / 10 = 10. But if there is 2% inflation, the toy will cost $10.20 the next year. This means you can only buy 9.8 toys because 100 / 10.2 = 9.8. \nInflation can be a problem because it reduces the purchasing power of money. This means that you can't buy as much with the same amount of money as you could before. This can be frustrating and can make it harder to afford the things you need. \nIt's true that some people's incomes may go up as prices increase, but not everyone's incomes will go up at the same rate as prices. This means that some people may not be able to afford the things they need as easily as they could before. \nInflation can also create uncertainty, which can make it harder for businesses to plan for the future and for people to make decisions about their finances. \nOverall, while a little bit of inflation can be good for an economy, high and unpredictable inflation can be a problem because it can make it harder for people to afford the things they need and can create uncertainty.",

When you listen to a song with a 4-bar rhythm, it's easy to follow along and tap your foot or clap your hands to the beat. \nAnother reason is that 4-bar rhythms are very flexible. Musicians can easily add or subtract beats, change the tempo, or change the arrangement of the music within a 4-bar structure, which gives them a lot of creative freedom. \nThere isn't anything inherently \"right\" about the number 4 when it comes to music. Different cultures and musical traditions have their own rhythmic structures, and some of them use rhythms that are based on 5, 7, or other numbers of beats.

    "answer": "Outer space is a vacuum, which means it's a place where there is very little matter, including air. If outer space were filled with air, it would be very different from what we experience on Earth. \nOne big difference is that there would be air pressure in outer space. On Earth, the air we breathe is heavy and pushes down on us, which is why we need to wear special suits to go outside in space. If there were air in outer space, it would also push down on us, but in a much weaker way. \nAnother difference is that things would be able to move through the air in outer space. Right now, objects in space like satellites and space stations have to use rockets or other special equipment to move around. But if there were air in outer space, they could just use their wings like airplanes do. \nOne unpleasant effect on our planet could be that the air in outer space would be very thin and not have enough oxygen for us to breathe. This means that we would still need special equipment to go into outer space, even if there was air. \nOverall, having air in outer space would be very different from what we experience on Earth, and it could be difficult for us to adapt to these changes.",

    "answer": "The \"thigh gap\" refers to a space between a person's thighs when they stand with their feet together and their knees facing forward. Some people believe that having a thigh gap is a sign of attractiveness or good health, and it has gained popularity as a physical ideal on social media and in some fashion magazines. \nHowever, it's important to note that the size of a person's thighs, or whether or not they have a gap between them, does not determine their attractiveness or health. In fact, having a thigh gap is not something that everyone can naturally achieve, as it is largely determined by genetics and body type. Some people may be more prone to having a thigh gap, while others may not be. \nIt's also worth noting that the idea of the thigh gap has been criticized for promoting unhealthy or unrealistic body standards, and for potentially causing people to feel self-conscious about their own bodies. It's important to remember that all bodies are unique and beautiful, and that there is no one \"perfect\" body type.",

    "answer": "Inheritance tax is a tax that is applied to the value of an inheritance that a person receives when someone passes away. In the UK, there is no tax on gambling winnings, so if you were to go to a casino and win your parents' money in a poker game, you would not have to pay any tax on it. However, there are a few things to consider: \n1. First of all, it is important to note that gambling can be risky and you could potentially lose the money that you are trying to win. \n2. Even if you do win the money, your parents may not be happy about it. They may have intended for you to inherit the money as part of their inheritance, and taking it from them in a gambling game could be seen as disrespectful or unfair. \n3. Finally, even though there is no tax on gambling winnings in the UK, there may be other legal or financial considerations to take into account. It is always a good idea to seek the advice of a financial professional or a lawyer before making any major financial decisions.",

    "answer": "Electric motors can produce a lot of torque, which makes them very good at providing strong and instant acceleration. This is why electric motors are used in some types of vehicles, such as electric cars and buses, where quick acceleration is important. \nHowever, electric motors also have some limitations that make them less practical for use in semi trucks and other heavy-duty vehicles. One of the main limitations is the amount of energy that can be stored in batteries. Batteries are currently not able to store as much energy as diesel fuel, which means that electric vehicles typically have a shorter range than diesel vehicles. This makes them less practical for long haul trucking, where the vehicles need to be able to travel long distances without stopping to recharge. \nAnother limitation of electric motors is the amount of time it takes to recharge the batteries. It can take several hours to fully charge the batteries of an electric vehicle, whereas a diesel vehicle can be refilled with fuel in just a few minutes. \nOverall, electric motors have the potential to be a very efficient and effective way to power vehicles, but they are not yet practical for use in all types of vehicles due to the current limitations of batteries and charging infrastructure.",

    "answer": "Time zones are used to keep track of time in different parts of the world. They help to ensure that people in different locations can coordinate their activities and communicate with one another. \nImagine if everyone used the same time all around the world. If you live in New York and want to talk to someone in Paris, you might have to stay up late or wake up very early because the time in Paris is different from the time in New York. But if you both use different time zones, you can easily figure out a time that works for both of you. \nTime zones are based on the rotation of the Earth on its axis. The Earth is divided into 24 equal \"slices\" called time zones. Each time zone is one hour ahead or behind the time in the time zone next to it. This helps to keep things organized and makes it easier for people to know what time it is in different parts of the world. \nSo even though it might seem simpler to not have time zones, they actually help us to stay organized and communicate with each other more easily.",

    "answer": "They stick a small pick up your eye socket , as your skull is thinnest there , the pick enters the prefrontal cortex of your your brain ( it 's that part of your brain responsible for memory , decision - making and logical thought ) from the bottom , the surgeon swishes the pick around and destroys a bit of the brain lobe . Generally , the patient is made to count from ten backwards repeatedly , when the patient can no longer count coherently , the surgeon deems that enough damage has been done and withdraws the pick . This is generally done to make \" uncontrollable \" mental patients more docile . The end result was a patient with severely retarded mental capacities and almost completely no sense of initiative . The above method ( Transorbital Lobotomy ) was popularized by the American doctor Walter Freeman ( who learned it from the Portuguese neurologist Ant\u00f3nio Egas Moniz , who would go on to win a Nobel for this \" invention \" ) . Freeman drove around America in a mobile lab he called the \" lobotomobile \" shilling his \" technique \" like some demented Kirby salesman . He preformed 3500 operations in the late 40s and boasted that the lobotomy would be as common as pulling teeth by the time he 's done with it ( the US would eventually lobotomize about 50 000 people , including children as young as 4 ) .

    "question": "How can unemployment drop to 5.6 % when we have a record number of people not working ? These are the two articles I read : URL_0 URL_1 Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The unemployment rate measures the percentage of people in the labor force who are looking for work but cannot find a job. It is calculated by dividing the number of unemployed people by the total number of people in the labor force, which includes both the employed and the unemployed. \nSometimes, the number of people who are unemployed can go up, even if the unemployment rate goes down. This can happen when the number of people in the labor force decreases. For example, if a lot of people stop looking for work because they are discouraged or have given up hope of finding a job, they are no longer counted as part of the labor force. As a result, the number of unemployed people is divided by a smaller number, which can lead to a lower unemployment rate. \nOn the other hand, if the number of people who are employed increases, the unemployment rate can go down, even if the number of people who are unemployed does not change. This can happen when more people start looking for work because they are more confident about finding a job. In this case, the number of unemployed people is divided by a larger number, which can lead to a lower unemployment rate. \nIt is important to look at both the unemployment rate and the total number of people who are unemployed when evaluating the state of the job market. Together, these two measures can give a more complete picture of the employment situation.",

    "answer": "The instinct to writhe or squirm during intense pain or pleasure is likely related to the body's natural response to try to protect itself or cope with the sensations it is experiencing. When we are in pain, for example, our bodies may automatically try to move or shift in an effort to find a position that is more comfortable or to get away from the source of the pain. Similarly, during pleasure, our bodies may naturally respond by moving or writhing as a way to enhance or intensify the sensation.

    "question": "How do music royalties work ? like in a movie for example , ( URL_0 ) does the artist / producers receive X amount of dollars per length of the song played ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Music royalties are payments made to songwriters, composers, and music publishers for the use of their musical works. When a song is played on the radio, streamed on a music service like Spotify, or used in a movie or television show, the copyright holders of the song are entitled to receive a royalty payment. \nThere are different types of music royalties, but one common type is a performance royalty. This is a payment that is made every time a song is performed publicly, such as when it is played on the radio or at a live event. Performance royalties are typically collected by a performing rights organization (PRO), such as ASCAP or BMI, on behalf of the songwriters and composers. \nThe amount of the royalty payment depends on a number of factors, including the type of use (e.g., radio, streaming, live performance), the length of the song, and the specific terms of the license agreement. In general, the longer a song is played, the more the copyright holders will be paid. \nFor example, if a song is used in a movie, the movie studio would typically negotiate a license agreement with the copyright holders (or their representatives) to use the song in the film. The terms of the agreement would determine the amount of the royalty payment, which could be a fixed fee or a percentage of the movie's profits. The copyright holders would then receive their royalty payment when the movie is released and the song is performed publicly as part of the film. \nI hope this helps to explain how music royalties work.

    "answer": "There is no law that requires employees to give two weeks' notice before quitting their job. However, it is a common practice for employees to give their employer some advance notice before leaving their job, especially if they have been with the company for a while. This is because it gives the employer time to find a replacement for the departing employee and to make any necessary arrangements. \nOn the other hand, there is no law that requires employers to give their employees advance notice before firing them. However, some employers may choose to do so out of a sense of fairness or to help the employee transition to a new job. In some cases, employers may be required by their own company policies or by collective bargaining agreements to give their employees a certain amount of notice before terminating their employment. \nIn general, the rules around notice periods and employment are different for employees and employers because they are in different positions in the employer-employee relationship. Employees are generally free to leave their job whenever they choose, while employers have more control over the terms of employment and can make decisions about hiring and firing.",

    "question": "What it that feeling of horrible burning when water goes up your nose when diving into a pool or just taking a shower and reaching down for something ? it feels awful , why does that happen , and what is happening to your nose and brain ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The main reason why water burns when it goes up your nose is because the salinity of the water does not match the salinity of the cells in your body . The salinity of freshwater is much lower than your body , so when water gets into your nose and into your sinuses , some of the cells that line the sinus and nasal cavities burst open and die because they rapidly suck in water - like overfilling a water balloon . Your body responds by rapidly secreting mucus to coat the remaining cells and protect them from the water . This whole thing involves three steps : ( 1 ) osmosis of water into the nasal cells ; ( 2 ) many cells burst ( cell lysis ) , and ( 3 ) the responds by releasing mucus . [ Link ] ( URL_0 )",

    "question": "What it that feeling of horrible burning when water goes up your nose when diving into a pool or just taking a shower and reaching down for something ? it feels awful , why does that happen , and what is happening to your nose and brain ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "When water goes up your nose, it can cause a burning sensation because the water irritates the sensitive tissue inside your nostrils. This is called \"nasal irritation.\" When you dive into a pool or take a shower, the water can also cause your sinuses (the air-filled spaces in your skull) to become pressurized. This pressure can cause a burning sensation in your nose, as well as a feeling of congestion or stuffiness. \nYour nose and sinuses are lined with tiny hair-like structures called cilia, which help to filter and moisten the air you breathe. When water gets into your nose, it can disrupt the function of the cilia and cause them to stop working properly. This can lead to irritation and inflammation, which can cause the burning sensation you feel. \nIn addition to the physical sensations, the feeling of water going up your nose can also be a bit scary and uncomfortable. It's important to be careful when diving into pools or taking showers to try to avoid getting water up your nose. If water does go up your nose, it's usually best to just blow your nose gently to get rid of the water and allow your nostrils and sinuses to return to their normal state.",

    "question": "How do Apple retailers sell their products at the same price as the Apple site ? How do they manage to do that while still gaining a profit ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Apple retailers, such as Apple Stores and authorized resellers, are able to sell Apple products at the same price as the Apple site because they have a special agreement with Apple to do so. This agreement allows them to purchase the products from Apple at a wholesale price, which is lower than the retail price that the products are sold for on the Apple site. The retailers are then able to sell the products at the same price as the Apple site, but still make a profit because they are buying the products at a lower price than they are selling them for. \nFor example, let's say that an Apple retailer buys an iPhone from Apple for $500 and then sells it for $700. The retailer is able to make a profit of $200 on the sale of the iPhone because they bought it for $500 and sold it for $700. This is how retailers are able to make a profit while still selling products at the same price as the Apple site.",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why products sold on infomercials might take longer to deliver than products purchased from a regular store or online retailer. \nFirst, infomercials are often used to sell products that are not widely available in stores or online. This means that the company may have to order the product from the manufacturer or supplier, which can take time. \nSecond, the company may have a large volume of orders to process and ship, which can take longer than if they were only processing a few orders. \nFinally, infomercial products may be shipped using a slower method of transportation, such as ground shipping, rather than a faster method like air shipping. This can also add to the delivery time. \nOverall, it's important to remember that delivery times can vary depending on the product, the company, and the shipping method being used. Some products may be delivered more quickly, while others may take longer.",

    "answer": "A semi-colon is a punctuation mark that is used to separate clauses in a sentence. It is similar to a period, but it is used to connect clauses that are closely related in meaning. Here is an example of a sentence with a semi-colon: \n\"I went to the store; I needed to buy some milk.\" \nIn this sentence, the two clauses are \"I went to the store\" and \"I needed to buy some milk.\" The semi-colon is used to connect these two clauses because they are closely related in meaning and are both part of the same thought. \nWe use semi-colons to help make our writing more clear and organized. They can be used to connect clauses that are not connected by a conjunction (such as \"and\" or \"but\") and to indicate a pause that is longer than a comma but shorter than a period. \nI hope this helps!

    "answer": "Saliva doesn't usually taste bad to kiss someone because it doesn't have a strong flavor on its own. However, if you lick or spit on something, the saliva may pick up the taste and smell of whatever it's on, which could make it taste or smell unpleasant. \nAs for why someone's mouth doesn't have to smell bad up close, it's because the mouth and saliva have natural bacteria and enzymes that help to break down food and keep the mouth clean. These bacteria and enzymes also help to prevent bad breath. However, if a person's mouth is not properly cared for, such as by brushing and flossing regularly and having a healthy diet, it can lead to a buildup of bacteria and cause bad breath or a bad smell in the mouth.",

It's also possible that police brutality has always been a problem, but it is only now being documented and reported more frequently due to advances in technology and the widespread use of smartphones to record and share events. \nIt's important to note that the vast majority of police officers are dedicated to serving and protecting their communities. However, there have been instances where some officers have used excessive force or have not followed proper procedures, which can lead to harm or even death for individuals who are in their custody.

    "question": "Why do n't athletes who attack other athletes in the middle of games get arrested on the spot ? Like a hockey player hitting another player in the nuts with the stick , etc . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Police are public servants and patrol public areas . There generally are n't police patrolling private stadiums and , where there are , their focus is more on the safety of the public / spectators , not the \" performers\"/athletes . So if a police officer were to see an athlete harm another athlete in a way that was * * completely , and explicitly illegal * * , they could and should arrest that individual . The issue is that contact - sports are a consenting arrangement between parties . How absurd would it be for an officer to have arrested Mike Tyson after one of his monster , brutal knock - outs ? Then again , why was n't Mike Tyson arrested after biting off a guy 's ear ? The answer , as pointed out in another comment , is that sports largely police themselves . All participants agree to a certain range of physical contact / harm . This \" consent \" makes much of the contact that occurs not really a \" crime \" and , rather , becomes purely a civil issue . This means that players who believe that another player exceeded the appropriate level of harm they consented to can bring them to court . There was a famous case years ago out of the NFL where a player was hit after the play had ended and was paralyzed . The judges had a lot to deal with . One of my favorite comments was something like , \" In a boxing match , boxers do not get to choose which blows they consent to receiving -- rather , they consent to the entirety of engagement . \" Facts that play into whether something crosses a line are ( a ) how often does it happen in the sport ( are the players aware of the risk ) , ( b ) did the act violate the official , enforced rules of the sport , ( c ) what are the penalties conveyed by the sports organization , etc . * * tl;dr :* * \" Arrested \" is something that happens to people who act in a way that justifies temporarily denying them freedom while the court can figure out if a law has been violated ... in many sports , everyone is a willing , consenting participant which makes it more of a civil issue than a legal one . * * Edit :* * Just to add something I mentioned in a different comment below -- another reason that intentional acts of violence are not criminal in a sport even if they are so seemingly outside the scope of being appropriate is that those acts are usually already handled by some sort of foul / penalty within the game . Hockey , for example , penalizes intentional , violent violations of its rules with varying penalty - box repercussions , suspensions , etc . The fact that specific penalties exist for intentional violent acts is an example of how it * * is * * a part of the game , and it is a part that has been consented to by all parties . Only when it exceeds an extreme , relative level will it become a criminal issue .",

    "answer": "Athletes who attack other athletes in the middle of games are usually punished by the rules of the game and the governing bodies of their sports. For example, in hockey, if a player hits another player in the nuts with their stick, they might receive a penalty or be ejected from the game. These punishments are meant to deter players from engaging in dangerous or unsportsmanlike behavior. \nIn some cases, an athlete's actions during a game might be considered criminal, such as if they intentionally hurt another player in a way that goes beyond the rules of the game. In these situations, the police might be called to investigate and the athlete could potentially face criminal charges. However, it is not common for athletes to be arrested on the spot during a game. \nOverall, the goal of punishing athletes who engage in dangerous or unsportsmanlike behavior is to keep the game safe and fair for all players and to maintain the integrity of the sport.",

You'll receive an email or message from the organizers with your match's name and Reddit username. \n4. Your Secret Santa will also receive your name and Reddit username, so you both know who you're buying a gift for. \n5. It's up to you and your Secret Santa to decide on a budget and what kind of gift to get for each other. Some people like to send physical gifts through the mail, while others prefer to send digital gifts, like a gift card or an online game. \n6.

Stay calm and try to stay with them. Panic attacks can be scary, and your housemate may feel very alone and overwhelmed. By staying with them, you can provide support and comfort. \n2. Encourage them to take slow, deep breaths. This can help to calm their body and mind. \n3. Talk to them in a soothing and reassuring voice.

    "question": "What 's the difference between Pubs and Bars ? And where do pubs get their names ? Just a thought that has crossed my mind a couple times - I also wondered why so many pubs have the same , or similar names ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "I 'm assuming this us a UK based question ? The word pub comes from the name public house . It originally meant a building that was open to the public to come and relax , socialise and most importantly consume alcohol . Noawadays the name public house means a building owned by a brewery , run by a tenant , for the sale and consumption of alcohol . In UK law you must have a license to sell alcohol , a license to have it consumed on your ( public commercial ) premises and another personal license to facilitate this sale . A pub in the UK is owned by the brewery . They have a tenant that buys the business within the building and then gets to keep the profit made from the sale in exchange for meeting the brewery 's minimum sale requirements . They must buy beer from the brewery and if they do n't buy enough they will be kicked out and another tenant will be found . This leads to , in more recent times , more pubs shutting down due to the aggressive nature of breweries . However you can also have free houses ( woohoo ) which are owned and run by the same person . They are open to buy beer from wholesale shops at a much cheaper price than would otherwise be available through the brewery . This means freehouses generally are cheaper than pubs and can have a different clientele . A bar is normally much more about alcohol than socialising . In a pub it is totally fine , in fact often expected , to sit at the bar with your drink and talk to the other people at the bar . You are of course not looked down upon by finding a private area , that is your choice , but it is often polite to stay and chat for a while . Bars are more aimed at limiting the bar area to sale only , once you have your drink you leave and go back to your private area and socialise mainly with those that you came out with . Pubs will often provide entertainment such as music , darts , snooker and/or pool , with snacks and occasionally food served too . Bars also open different hours to pubs . Because pubs are a social location , in the UK at least many pubs open earlier in the day than bars , sometimes noon , but quite often around 4 pm I have found . Bars are more aimed at night time and weekend rushes and are a more commercial location",

Bars are found in many different countries and serve a variety of alcoholic beverages. \nPubs and bars can have similar names because they often serve similar purposes and may be owned by the same company.

    "answer": "Data caps on internet service plans are put in place by internet service providers (ISPs) to limit the amount of data that customers can use each month. The idea is that by limiting the amount of data that customers can use, the ISPs can manage their network resources more effectively and offer a more stable and reliable service to all of their customers. \nFor example, if an ISP has a limited amount of bandwidth available and all of their customers are using large amounts of data at the same time, it could cause the network to become congested, leading to slower speeds and a less reliable service. By implementing data caps, the ISP can ensure that there is enough bandwidth available for all of their customers to use, even during times of heavy usage. \nWhile data caps may seem inconvenient for people who use a lot of data, they can be a good option for people who don't use the internet very much or who only need a basic level of service. For example, if you only use the internet to check email and browse the web, a data cap may be sufficient for your needs and can save you money on your monthly internet bill.",

    "answer": "Yes, humans do need darkness in order to sleep well. Our bodies have an internal clock that regulates our sleep-wake cycle, and this clock is influenced by the presence of light. When it is dark, our bodies produce a hormone called melatonin that helps us feel tired and fall asleep. \nIf you are always exposed to light, especially bright light, it can disrupt your body's natural sleep-wake cycle and make it harder for you to fall asleep at night. This is because the light can suppress the production of melatonin, making you feel more awake and alert. \nIt is generally recommended to create a dark and quiet environment for sleep, as this can help you fall asleep more easily and get better quality sleep. It is also a good idea to turn off electronics, such as TVs and phones, before going to bed, as the light from these devices can also disrupt your sleep-wake cycle. \nSo, to answer your question, it is important to have darkness in order to sleep well and maintain a healthy sleep-wake cycle.",

The cursor is like a toy car that you're driving around inside the picture frame. If you try to drive the toy car off the edge of the picture frame, it will disappear from view. But if you keep the toy car inside the picture frame, you can see it and control where it goes. That's why the cursor disappears when you move it to the right or left of the screen, but stops at the edge when you move it up or down.",

    "answer": "It is not uncommon for important announcements to be made at night or during off-peak hours. This can be for a variety of reasons, such as to minimize disruption to the public or to avoid causing a rush of activity. In the case of the Michael Brown / Ferguson, Mo. decision, it is possible that the authorities wanted to avoid any potential unrest or violence that might occur in response to the announcement. By making the announcement late at night, they may have hoped to minimize the number of people who would be awake and able to respond to the news.",

    "answer": "In a plane crash into water, there are many factors that can contribute to the deaths of passengers. One possibility is that some passengers may drown if they are unable to escape the submerged wreckage or if they are unable to swim to the surface. Another possibility is that some passengers may die from injuries sustained in the crash itself, such as fractures, internal injuries, or head injuries. These injuries can be caused by the impact of the crash, as well as by being thrown around inside the plane or by being struck by debris. In some cases, passengers may also die from hypothermia if they are in cold water for an extended period of time. It's also possible that some passengers may die from a combination of these factors.",

    "question": "What makes hypoallergenic dogs / cats hypoallergenic ? I saw someone say that it 's because these animals have hair , not fur . What 's the difference ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The part that makes people allergic to cats is actually a protein ( FEL D1 ) found in their saliva . When a cat licks herself , she deposits the protein on her skin , and when it dries off , the flakes become airborne and trigger symptoms of allergy in people . So , it 's not the fur that 's the issue , it 's the dead skin . In short , there 's no cat that 's 100 % hypoallergenic , they can only produce less of the protein FEL D1 than regular cats . Some cats tend to be preferred because of trial and error , and even then , some of the most likely to not cause allergies still do because maintenance is required ( like bathing or brushing ) to make those pets optimal .",

    "question": "What makes hypoallergenic dogs / cats hypoallergenic ? I saw someone say that it 's because these animals have hair , not fur . What 's the difference ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "A hypoallergenic animal is one that is less likely to cause an allergic reaction in people who are sensitive to pets. The term \"hypoallergenic\" does not mean that the animal is completely allergy-free, but it usually means that it produces fewer allergens, which are proteins that can cause an allergic reaction. \nDogs and cats have both hair and fur. The main difference between the two is that hair is usually longer and coarser, while fur is shorter and softer. Hair also tends to shed less than fur. Some people believe that animals with hair, rather than fur, are less likely to cause allergies because they produce fewer allergens. However, this is not necessarily true for all hypoallergenic pets. \nThere are several breeds of dogs and cats that are considered hypoallergenic because they produce fewer allergens than other breeds. These breeds may have hair rather than fur, or they may have a different type of fur that is less likely to cause an allergic reaction. Some examples of hypoallergenic dog breeds include the Bichon Frise, Poodle, and Schnauzer. Some examples of hypoallergenic cat breeds include the Devon Rex, Sphynx, and Siamese. \nIt's important to note that while these breeds may be less likely to cause an allergic reaction, they are not completely allergy-free. If you are allergic to pets and want to get one, it's a good idea to spend some time with the animal before you make a commitment to ensure that you are not allergic to it.",

    "answer": "There are many complex reasons why some countries, including many in Africa, have not developed as quickly as others in terms of technology, politics, and humanitarian issues. Here are a few reasons that might help explain it: \n1. History: Many African countries have a history of colonialism, which often meant that their resources were exploited by other countries and their own governments were not allowed to make decisions that were in the best interest of their people. This can make it hard for a country to develop and progress. \n2. Poverty: Many African countries have high levels of poverty, which can make it difficult for people to afford the education and resources needed to advance in science, technology, and other fields. \n3. Infrastructure: In order for a country to have a strong economy and support technological and political progress, it needs to have good infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, schools, and hospitals. Some African countries have limited infrastructure, which can make it hard for people to access the resources they need to thrive. \n4. Political instability: Some African countries have had periods of political instability, which can make it hard for the government to focus on long-term development goals. \n5. Natural disasters: Many African countries are prone to natural disasters such as droughts, floods, and earthquakes, which can disrupt development and make it hard for people to live stable, healthy lives. \nIt's important to remember that every country is different and has its own unique challenges. There are many African countries that are making progress and working to overcome these challenges, and it's important to support and encourage their efforts.",

    "answer": "Down syndrome is a condition that occurs when a person has an extra copy of a chromosome, specifically chromosome 21. Chromosomes are pieces of DNA that contain the instructions for our bodies' functions. Having an extra copy of a chromosome can cause problems with the way the body develops and functions. \nIn the case of Down syndrome, having an extra copy of chromosome 21 can cause delays in physical and mental development, as well as certain physical characteristics such as a flattened face and short stature. It can also increase the risk of certain health problems, such as heart defects and problems with the digestive system. \nWhile having an extra copy of a chromosome may sound like it could give a person extra abilities, in reality it can cause problems because our bodies are designed to work with a certain number of chromosomes. When there is an extra chromosome, it can disrupt the normal functioning of the body and cause difficulties.",

    "answer": "War can make money for various individuals and organizations in a number of ways. Here are a few examples: \n1. Governments can make money by selling weapons and other military equipment to other countries that are involved in a war. This can be a significant source of revenue for countries that are major producers of military equipment, such as the United States. \n2. Private military contractors and other companies can make money by providing services to governments and other organizations involved in a war. For example, a company might be hired to provide security, transportation, or logistical support. \n3. Some individuals and organizations can make money by taking advantage of the chaos and instability caused by a war. For example, they might engage in illegal activities like smuggling, black market trade, or theft. \n4.

    "question": "Why do people have fetishes , and why are some more extreme than others ? Some people like feet , others like bondage , and a few like balloons . Why is that ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Early psychology assumed that fetishism either is being conditioned or imprinted or the result of a strong emotional ( possibly traumatic ) or physical experience . Often , these experiences occurred in early childhood . For example , an individual who has been physically abused could either have a sexual obsession with intercourse , or they could be completely terrified by even the idea of being touched . Physical factors like genetic disposition are another common possible explanation . In the following , the most important theories are presented in chronological order : Alfred Binet suspected fetishism was the pathological result of associations . Accidentally simultaneous presentation of a sexual stimulus and an inanimate object , he argued , led to the object being permanently connected to sexual arousal . The sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld followed another line of thought when he proposed his theory of partial attractiveness in 1920 . According to his argument , sexual attractiveness never originates in a person as a whole but always is the product of the interaction of individual features . He stated that nearly everyone had special interests and thus suffered from a healthy kind of fetishism , while only detaching and overvaluing of a single feature resulted in pathological fetishism . Today , Hirschfeld 's theory is often mentioned in the context of gender role specific behavior : females present sexual stimuli by highlighting body parts , clothes or accessories ; males react to them . * * tl;dr : It 's a normal and healthy part of human sexuality . * *",

    "answer": "A fetish is a strong sexual interest in a specific object, body part, or activity. People have different fetishes because everyone is different, and everyone has their own unique likes and dislikes when it comes to sexual attraction.

It's important to remember that having a fetish does not make someone abnormal or unhealthy. However, it's also important to recognize that some fetishes can be dangerous or harmful to others, and it's important to respect other people's boundaries and consent. \nIt's not clear why some fetishes are more extreme or uncommon than others.

    "answer": "Cooking vegetables can sometimes cause the loss of some of the nutrients they contain. This can happen because the heat of cooking can cause the breakdown of some of the nutrients, or because the nutrients can leach out into the water that the vegetables are cooked in. \nMicrowaving can also cause the loss of some nutrients in vegetables because it uses high-frequency waves to cook the food, which can cause the breakdown of some nutrients. \nTo help prevent the loss of nutrients when cooking vegetables, there are a few things you can try: \n1. Use minimal water when cooking vegetables, or steam them instead of boiling them. \n2. Cook vegetables for the shortest amount of time possible. \n3. Eat the vegetables as soon as they are cooked, or store them properly to help preserve the nutrients. \n4. Eat a variety of vegetables to ensure you are getting a wide range of nutrients. \n5.

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why car and truck companies might not make new vehicles that look like older models with new technology. \nOne reason is that new technology often requires new designs to accommodate it. For example, electric vehicles (EVs) require a different kind of powertrain than gasoline-powered vehicles, and this difference in powertrain might require a different kind of body or frame. \nAnother reason is that car and truck companies want to keep their products fresh and appealing to customers. This means that they might want to update the appearance of their vehicles to reflect current trends and styles. \nFinally, it can be expensive to develop and produce new vehicles, and car and truck companies need to consider whether there is enough demand for a particular type of vehicle to justify the cost. If a company thinks that there is not enough demand for a new vehicle that looks like an older model, they might decide not to invest in creating it. \nI hope this helps to explain things!

    "answer": "As someone who dislikes them all equally , I 'll give it a go . At least no one can accuse me of being biased . * * Conservatives * * - nicknamed the Tories . The larger party in the current coalition government . A centre - right party , and so are interested in lowering taxes and using free trade as a means to bolster the economy . They believe in small government , which under Thatcher meant privatisation of public services like railways , utilities and the mail . These services used to be run by the government , but were sold off to private companies . Under the current administration , they have been cutting the budgets of remaining public services like welfare , local authorities and the NHS at the same time as cutting taxes for top - earners and letting companies like Starbucks and Vodafone away with not paying corporation tax . Basically letting the rich get richer and the poor get shat on . * * Labour * * - traditionally the party of the working class , and up until the late 1990s , the opposite of the Tories . They are a centre - left party , interested in a society in which the rich help the poor by way of free public services , a robust welfare system , and higher taxation for the wealthy . Before the 1997 general election , Tony Blair took the party in a new direction ( \" New Labour \" ) which similarly appealed to the middle classes as well as the working class . Effectively , he moved the party away from all - out socialism to a more centrist party . The party is now at odds with itself , with some members looking for \" Blairism , \" a more centrist party , and others still rocking the old socialism . The party does not have a strong leader , they are about to lose swathes of voters in Scotland which was previously a Labour stronghold ( more on this later ) , and do not have policies which could reverse the damage done to the lower classes ' quality of life under the current administration . If British politics was Sega vs Nintendo in the 90s , then Labour are Sega . They used to be giants , now they 're fucking nothing . * * Liberal Democrats * * - The smaller party in the current coalition . Another centre - left party , but a little more radical and progressive than Labour . Since Tony Blair , they have moved to occupy the leftist void left by Labour 's move to the centre . They have always been a little too intellectual and \" out there \" to engage the working class as Labour did , but they have strong policies on social justice , welfare and the role of local authority . There were a strong third party when British politics was all Labour vs Tory . Since coming to power as part of the coalition , the party has been on a thundering campaign of self - harm . They do n't have the electoral clout to stop the Tories ' harsher policies , and have gone back on their own election promises ( like not raising tuition fees ) . Their leader was once seen as a ray of sunshine in British politics , now he is just Cameron 's stooge . * * UKIP * * - the UK Independence party . The party started as a crowd of ex - Tories who were annoyed by the Conservative party 's embracing of European politics . They pledged to withdraw the UK from the European Union . They do alarmingly well in council and European elections , and seem to draw media attention far greater than their electoral representation should warrant . They have policies on immigration that seem outright racist , and have a habit of blaming immigration for all the country 's woes . People will still vote for them , because people turn to nationalism in times of austerity , sad as that is . * * SNP * * - the Scottish National Party . Speaking of nationalism ... There was a referendum on Scottish independence this year . The pro - independence side lost , but not by very much . The final vote was 55%-45 % in favour of staying in the union . The SNP was the largest party in the Yes coalition ( the pro - indy side ) , and their membership has skyrocketed since the referendum . They are now apparently the third - largest party in the UK , despite only representing 10 % of its population . Scottish Labour were pro - union during the referendum , which many party supporters saw as a betrayal , since they were jumping into bed with the Tories ( properly called the Conservative & Unionist Party ) . Labour support in Scotland has plummeted . Away from the referendum , the SNP do extraordinarily well as leaders of the devolved Scottish Government . They are the majority party in an electoral system that is not supposed to allow one party to hold an outright majority . They have very popular policies like free travel for over-60s , free prescriptions for all , low tuition fees and a student loan system , and a freeze on council tax . They are expected to do very well indeed in the next general election , perhaps representing a majority of Scottish voters at Westminster . * * Plaid Cymru * * - the Welsh national party . Not as popular as the SNP , but not as radical either . They do n't advocate an independent Wales ( despite a lot of Welsh support for just that ) , they only seek to look after Welsh interests in Westminster and the Welsh assembly , which they lead in coalition with Labour . With nationalism on the rise nationwide , they may see a surge in votes at the next election , but not to the same degree as the SNP are expected to . * * Greens * * - as with Green parties worldwide , they have policies of environmental responsibility , sustainability and social justice . I actually like their policies a lot , I 'm even a member , but this is not their time . The Scottish Greens were pro - independence and saw a similar surge in membership post - referendum , but not on anything like the scale that the SNP saw . The Green Party of England & Wales have an elected member and look likely to add a couple more by careful targeting of election seats , but they are n't a party of government quite yet . * * Others * * - there 's also all the Northern Irish parties , which would be an essay unto themselves , and a bunch of parties without any seats right now who do n't look likely to get any in the next election , like the Christian Democratic Party , the Pirate Party , the Scottish Socialists , the Monster Raving Loony Party ...",

    "answer": "A \" hostile takeover \" allows a bidder to take over a target company whose management is unwilling to agree to a merger or takeover . A takeover is considered \" hostile \" if the target company 's board rejects the offer , but the bidder continues to pursue it , or the bidder makes the offer directly after having announced its firm intention to make an offer . A hostile takeover can be conducted in several ways . A tender offer can be made where the acquiring company makes a public offer at a fixed price above the current market price . Tender offers in the United States are regulated by the Williams Act . An acquiring company can also engage in a proxy fight , whereby it tries to persuade enough shareholders , usually a simple majority , to replace the management with a new one which will approve the takeover . Another method involves quietly purchasing enough stock on the open market , known as a \" creeping tender offer \" , to affect a change in management . In all of these ways , management resists the acquisition , but it is carried out anyway .",

    "question": "how do hostile takeovers work . And what 's up with 5 % . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "A hostile takeover is when a company tries to take control of another company without the support of the company's management or board of directors. This can happen when the company that is trying to take over, called the \"acquirer,\" makes an offer to buy the other company, called the \"target,\" directly to the target's shareholders. The acquirer usually offers a higher price per share than what the shares are currently worth on the stock market, which can be tempting for the target's shareholders. \nOne way that the acquirer can try to take over the target is by buying a large number of the target's shares, usually at least 5%. When an acquirer owns 5% or more of a company's shares, it is required to disclose this information to the public and the company. This is because owning a large percentage of a company's shares can give the acquirer significant influence over the company's decisions. \nIf the acquirer is able to buy enough shares to gain control of the target, it can then try to replace the target's management and board of directors with its own people. This can be done through a vote of the shareholders. If the acquirer is successful in replacing the management and board, it can then take control of the company and make decisions about how to run it. \nHowever, hostile takeovers can be risky and can sometimes lead to legal battles between the acquirer and the target. The target's management and board may also try to fight the takeover by trying to find another company to buy the target or by making it more difficult for the acquirer to buy the necessary shares.",

    "answer": "Birthmarks are spots on the skin that are present at birth or appear shortly after birth. They are very common and can appear anywhere on the body. Some birthmarks are red or pink, while others are brown or black. They can be flat or raised, and some are smooth while others are bumpy. \nThere are two main types of birthmarks: vascular birthmarks and pigmented birthmarks. Vascular birthmarks are caused by abnormal blood vessels in the skin, and they can be red, pink, or purple. Pigmented birthmarks are caused by an excess of pigment in the skin, and they can be brown or black. \nBirthmarks are usually harmless and don't cause any problems. Some people choose to have them removed for cosmetic reasons, but this is not necessary. Most birthmarks fade or disappear on their own over time.",

    "answer": "American sports leagues like the NHL (National Hockey League) and NBA (National Basketball Association) have Canadian teams because Canada is part of North America and has a strong interest in sports. These sports leagues have teams from both the United States and Canada because they want to be able to include as many fans as possible from both countries. \nIn the NHL, there are seven Canadian teams, including the Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, Vancouver Canucks, and Winnipeg Jets. In the NBA, there is only one Canadian team, the Toronto Raptors. \nHaving Canadian teams in these leagues allows fans in Canada to root for a team that is located closer to them, rather than having to support a team that is far away in the United States. It also allows the leagues to expand their reach and potentially attract more fans from Canada. \nOverall, having Canadian teams in American sports leagues helps to bring people from different countries together through their shared love of sports.",

    "answer": "Giving money as a gift is often considered impersonal because it can feel like the giver did not put much thought or effort into choosing a gift. A gift card, on the other hand, shows that the giver has at least considered the recipient's interests or needs and has chosen a gift card for a specific store or type of merchandise that the recipient might enjoy. \nGift cards also have the added advantage of being more flexible than cash, as the recipient can choose to use the gift card at a later date or save it for a special occasion. With cash, the recipient may feel pressure to spend it right away or may not know how to best use the money. \nOverall, the main difference between giving money and giving a gift card is the perceived level of thought and effort that goes into the gift. While both options can be practical and appreciated, a gift card can feel more personal and considerate because it shows that the giver took the time to select a gift specifically for the recipient.",

First, you need to decide what you want your new name to be. This can be any name you choose, as long as it is not being used to commit fraud or deceive others. \n2. Next, you will need to fill out some paperwork and file it with the government agency that handles name changes in your area. This is usually a court or government office. You will need to provide some personal information, such as your current name, your new name, and your reason for wanting to change your name. \n3. After you file your paperwork, you will need to go to a court hearing to get approval for your name change. At the hearing, a judge will review your request and make a decision about whether to approve it. \n4. If the judge approves your name change, you will be given a court order that legally changes your name. You will need to provide this court order to any government agency or organization that needs to know about your new name, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles or your employer. \nOverall, the process of changing your name can take a few weeks or even a few months, depending on your location and the specific requirements of your government agency.",

    "answer": "When you have a cold, your body's immune system is working hard to fight off the virus that is causing your illness. One of the ways it does this is by producing extra mucus, which helps to keep the virus from spreading and also helps to moisturize and protect the inside of your nose. \nMucus is made by special cells in the lining of your nose and sinuses, and it's usually a clear, sticky liquid. When you have a cold, your body makes more of it than usual, and it can sometimes seem like your nose is producing an alarming amount of mucus. This is perfectly normal and is just your body's way of trying to protect you and help you feel better. \nSo, if your nose is producing a lot of mucus when you have a cold, don't worry!

    "answer": "Orbiting an object means moving around it in a circle while staying a certain distance away from it. To put an object into orbit around the Earth, we have to use a rocket. \nThe rocket has to be powerful enough to lift the object off the ground and high into the air. Then, the rocket has to be pointed in the right direction and go fast enough to escape the Earth's gravity. If the rocket goes fast enough and is aimed at the right angle, the object will start orbiting the Earth. \nTo make sure that there aren't any collisions with other objects in space, we use a system called \"traffic control.\" Traffic control helps us track where all the objects in space are and where they're going. We use computers to do this. If two objects are going to get too close to each other, we can use traffic control to send a signal to one of the objects and change its course so that it doesn't crash into the other object. This helps us keep track of all the objects in space and make sure that they're all safe.",

    "answer": "In general , we have what we call blood types as a result of our immune system , and how it deals with foreign entities . That 's my understanding anyways . You mention evolution in the question , so I 'll address that first . What we call \" evolution \" is more like a result of a number of factors . Understanding that brings us to why we have features that seem useless or even situationally disadvantageous . When a mutation occurs , the mutation itself does n't care about the organism 's chances at survival due to the change . That 's where \" natural selection \" comes into play , where organisms that do n't get to reproduce die off . But if the organism does reproduce , then the change is kept , and is passed on . That 's evolution So then , why do we have different blood types ? Because some where down the line , we developed antigens , and then they split off into two types , and at no point did they disadvantage the organism . They only become disadvantageous when you need to artificially ( the only way you can ) perform a blood - transfusion .",

    "question": "Evolutionarily speaking , why are there different blood types ? There 's A , B , AB , and O but why are there different alleles anyway ? Would n't it be simpler just to have one blood type ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Sure! So, blood types are determined by the presence or absence of certain proteins, called antigens, on the surface of red blood cells. There are two main antigens that determine blood type: A and B. People who have the A antigen on their red blood cells are said to have type A blood, while people who have the B antigen on their red blood cells are said to have type B blood. People who have both A and B antigens on their red blood cells are said to have type AB blood, and people who have neither A nor B antigens on their red blood cells are said to have type O blood. \nNow, why do we have different blood types in the first place? Well, that's because different blood types have different functions in the body. For example, type A blood is good at protecting against certain diseases, while type B blood is good at carrying oxygen to the body's tissues. Having different blood types allows our bodies to be better equipped to handle different challenges and situations. \nSo, while it might seem simpler to just have one blood type, having different blood types actually gives us an evolutionary advantage. It's kind of like how humans have different eye colors, or how there are different breeds of dogs - they all have different characteristics that help them thrive in different environments.

    "answer": "The cost of a PC component, such as a processor, is determined by a variety of factors, including the materials and technology used to make it, the cost of research and development, and the overall demand for the product. More expensive processors often use more advanced technology and materials, which can make them more expensive to produce. In addition, more expensive processors may be targeted at a higher-end market, where consumers are willing to pay more for a product with better performance. \nIt's also important to keep in mind that the price of a processor is just one factor to consider when building a PC. Other components, such as the motherboard, memory, and graphics card, can also have a significant impact on a PC's performance and overall cost.

    "answer": "Shooting a gun into the air is very dangerous and should never be done. When a bullet is fired from a gun, it travels very fast and has a lot of energy. This energy can cause the bullet to travel long distances, even miles, before it comes back down to the ground. When the bullet comes back down, it can still have a lot of energy and can cause serious injury or death if it hits someone. \nImagine you throw a rock up into the air. It goes up, up, up and then comes back down. When it comes back down, it might not hit you, but it could still hurt if it lands on your foot. A bullet is like a very fast and heavy rock that can travel much farther than a rock and has the potential to cause much more damage. \nShooting a gun into the air is not only dangerous for the person who is shot, but also for anyone else who might be nearby. Even if the bullet does not hit anyone directly, it can still cause harm if it lands on a hard surface and breaks into pieces, or if it hits something else and bounces off in a different direction. \nIn short, shooting a gun into the air is very dangerous and should never be done.

In some cases, the label of \"terrorist\" may be used to discredit or delegitimize the actions of a group or individual, even if their actions do not meet the legal definition of terrorism. \nUltimately, the label of \"terrorist\" is a subjective and often controversial one, and whether or not a group or individual is considered a terrorist can depend on the context in which they are operating and the motivations and actions they are perceived to have.

Additionally, luck and timing can also play a role in a musician's success. For example, a musician may be in the right place at the right time and get discovered by a record label, or they may have access to resources and connections that can help them get their music out there. Ultimately, the music industry is complex and there are no guarantees of success, even for talented musicians.",

    "question": "Why is there so much hype surrounding Fifty Shades of Grey ? From an outside perspective it just seems everyone has a secret bdsm fantasy . I 've never read the books and I 'm curious why everyone was so crazy over that book Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Well , in terms of actual BDSM it is actually an incredibly shitty book . The guy in it is basically the textbook example of a shitty , abusive dom . That said , the book is not aimed at people in the BDSM lifestyle . It is aimed at average women with a ravishment fantasy . And there are many of those out there . There was one college study that found roughly half of the women had ravishment fantasies . Why ? Because in general it is a way to avoid any guilt . Women are raised with lots of conflicting sexual messages . Be sexy , but do n't be a slut ! Wait until marriage , but if you say no to a man , you are a frigid bitch . There is lots of attention to male sexuality , but very little to female sexuality ( at least not women owned female sexuality ) . And a lot of these conflicting messages lead to very many women having some level of guilt about enjoying sex . They enjoyed this , are they now a slut ? With ravishment fantasies you kind of bypass that guilt because it is someone else ' forcing ' you to do something . You were n't the one making the decisions , so none of the guilt can rest on you . Additionally , there are many women with a very low self esteem . To these women too , these kind of ravishment fantasies can also be highly attractive , because it basically means that a guy finds them so attractive ( even if they do n't find themselves attractive ) that he can not contain himself . Fifty Shades of Grey plays into a lot of these sexual tropes , which is what made it so popular . It is also written in a very simple , accessible way , so it is easy to pick up even by people who do n't read a lot . ( Just as a note , there are also a lot of men that have ravishment fantasies . Not quite as many as women , but it is not a female - only thing or something . )",

    "answer": "Fifty Shades of Grey is a bestselling novel that was published in 2011. The book and its sequels, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed, have been widely read and have gained a significant following, particularly among women. The books tell the story of a young woman named Anastasia Steele who becomes involved in a BDSM (bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism, and masochism) relationship with a wealthy businessman named Christian Grey. The books explore themes of love, romance, and sexual desire, and have been described as \"mommy porn\" due to their explicit sexual content. Many people became interested in the books because they offer a glimpse into the world of BDSM, which is a topic that is often shrouded in mystery and taboo. The books were also popular because they were written from the perspective of a woman and were seen as a departure from traditional romance novels, which often feature a male protagonist.",

I 'm a newly diagnosed Type 1 Diabetic and with the relatively \" convenient \" pocket glucometers that we have now how much more inconvenient would diabetes be without them ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Before personal glucometers, diabetics had to visit their healthcare provider to have their blood sugar levels checked. This typically involved taking a small sample of blood from the finger using a needle and sending it to a laboratory to be analyzed. This process was not only inconvenient, but it also required a lot of time and effort, as the individual had to make a trip to the healthcare provider's office or clinic. \nPersonal glucometers have made it much easier for diabetics to monitor their blood sugar levels on their own, as they can be used at home or on the go. With a glucometer, a person with diabetes can simply prick their finger, place a drop of blood on a test strip, and get a reading of their blood sugar level within seconds. This allows them to make adjustments to their insulin doses or other treatments as needed to help keep their blood sugar levels within a healthy range. \nOverall, personal glucometers have made it much more convenient for diabetics to manage their condition and have likely had a significant impact on improving the health outcomes of people with diabetes.",

    "answer": "US politics are extremely divided along internal cultural lines . It is exceedingly rare in the US to change which party you vote for - they appeal to an entirely different group of people , and focus their policies around that group of people . Where many other democracies have parties who 's fortunes rise and fall with the economy or popular culture , in America you are either liberal or conservative , and you generally will shift at most once in your lifetime . Red States are states that almost always vote Republican . Places like Utah or Texas , where a majority of people are conservatives . Blue States are states that almost always vote Democrat . Places like New York or California , where a majority of people are liberals . Swing states are states that have about 50 % of each . This is a place where the ebb and flow of politics has an impact , because how ' energized ' conservatives or liberals feel will impact how many go to the polls . Because of that , these states change who they vote for from election to election - not because their citizens change parties , but because when 10 % fewer liberals vote than usual that electorate swings conservative . It 's a caustic problem that has lead to parties crafting policy to energize their bases , rather than trying to appeal to Americans as a whole .

    "answer": "A swing state is a state that does not consistently vote for the same political party in presidential elections. These states are considered important because the outcome of the election can be influenced by the results in these states. \nThere are a few reasons why certain states are typically swing states. One reason is that the population of these states is evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, so the outcome of the election in these states is often very close. \nAnother reason is that these states have a large number of electoral votes, which are used to determine the winner of the presidential election. The more electoral votes a state has, the more influence it has on the outcome of the election. \nFinally, swing states are often targeted by both political parties because they can be won over with targeted campaign efforts. This means that both parties will spend a lot of time and resources trying to get people in these states to vote for their candidate.",

    "question": "What happens when you use water from an electric well when you have no power ? What kind of damage can it cause ? Aparently it can hurt some kind of pressure tank ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "An electric well is a type of well that uses an electric pump to bring water up from underground and into your home. When you use water from an electric well, the pump turns on and sends water through a pipe and into your home. If you try to use water from an electric well when there is no power, the pump will not be able to turn on and the water will not be able to flow. This means that you will not be able to use any water from the well until the power comes back on. \nIf you try to use water from an electric well when there is no power, it could cause damage to the pressure tank. The pressure tank is a large container that holds water under pressure. When you turn on a faucet or use water in any way, the pressure in the tank decreases. When the pressure in the tank gets low enough, the pump turns on and adds more water to the tank to bring the pressure back up. If you try to use water from an electric well when there is no power, the pump will not be able to turn on and the pressure in the tank will not be able to stay high enough. This can cause the tank to become damaged or even burst, which could cause water to leak out and cause damage to your home. \nIn summary, if you try to use water from an electric well when there is no power, it will not be able to flow and it could cause damage to the pressure tank. It is important to make sure that the power is on before you try to use water from an electric well.",

    "answer": "1 . The economy does n't work like that . There are n't a lot of jobs in a lot of places . Unemployment may be back to relatively close to pre-2007 but the jobs that have been coming back have been created have overwhelmingly been low wage jobs . Throw onto that the fact that they put many small businesses out of business since they ca n't compete with the prices at Walmart , and Walmart can only sell at those prices by paying poverty wages at nearly every level of their operation . 2 . Why not ? Somebody has to stand up to Walmart , and politicians wo n't . All Walmart cares about is making money , and they do n't make money if workers do n't work . They are using collective action to make Walmart listen and respect their right to form a union . Walmart pretty much by policy violates labor laws every day by firing pro - union workers , telling employees not to talk about how much they make , and even making people work off the clock . 3 . Service work us the new bedrock of our economy . You ca n't outsource it . It 's here to stay . We can decide to make those jobs good middle class jobs . You probably think of jobs in manufacturing as solid middle class jobs . Well , until workers in the 20s and 30s started striking in the steel mills , paper mills , etc . , those jobs were the worst , most dangerous , lowest paying jobs around . But those workers fought to form unions , make their voices heaed , and made a whole new class of middle class jobs that led to the great expansion of the middle class in the 50s and 60s .

    "answer": "I'm sorry, but I don't have any information about Walmart employees going on strike. It's possible that you may be misunderstanding the situation or that there is misinformation being circulated. \nIn general, people go on strike when they are unhappy with their working conditions or pay, and they want to try to negotiate for better treatment. They do this by refusing to work until their demands are met. Going on strike is a way for workers to try to get their employer to listen to their concerns and make changes. \nSometimes, people may decide to quit their job and find another one if they are unhappy with their current employer. However, this is not always a feasible option, especially if the person is in a financial or personal situation where they are unable to leave their job. In these cases, people may choose to go on strike instead of quitting in order to try to improve their working conditions.",

When you crack your knuckles, you are pulling on the bones that make up the joint, which stretches the joint capsule. Inside the joint capsule, there is a small amount of synovial fluid, which is a lubricating fluid that helps to reduce friction in the joint. When you stretch the joint capsule, tiny pockets of air or gas can become trapped in the synovial fluid. As you continue to stretch the joint capsule, the pockets of air become larger and eventually burst, causing the cracking sound that you hear. The air that was trapped in the joint capsule then escapes and the joint goes back to its normal state.",

    "answer": "The most popular type uses the heat from radioactive decay to heat water and push the steam through turbines that spin and produce the power . \" Starting up \" a reactor means removing enough of the control rods ( radiation absorbers ) that the fuel gets hot and boils water to steam . Maintaining a stable reaction requires inserting or removing fuel or control rods so the temperature and reactions stay within defined ranges . For extra security , a huge pool of water is generally over the rods to absorb errant radiation and cool the rods should trouble arise . Storing the energy does not happen . It 's being created so it can be used nearly immediately .

    "question": "how does a nuclear reactor work ? Including how it starts up and maintains stability to how its energy get stored . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Sure! A nuclear reactor is a machine that uses nuclear reactions to generate heat, which is then used to produce electricity. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works: \n1. Inside the reactor, there are fuel rods made of a special type of metal called uranium. These fuel rods contain tiny particles called atoms. \n2. When an atom is hit by a neutron (a small particle found in the nucleus of an atom), it can split into two smaller atoms, called fission. This releases a lot of energy in the form of heat. \n3. To start the reactor, the fuel rods are placed inside the reactor and the atoms are hit with neutrons to start the fission process. This heat is used to turn water into steam, which is used to spin a turbine. The turbine is connected to a generator, which produces electricity. \n4. To maintain stability, the reactor has control rods that can be inserted into the reactor to absorb excess neutrons and slow down the fission process. This helps to control the amount of heat being produced and keeps the reactor running safely. \n5. The electricity produced by the reactor is stored in a power grid and can be used to power homes and businesses. \nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.",

People have always needed to keep track of time in order to know when to do things, like when to plant crops, when to go to bed, and when to meet up with friends. \nOne way that people have measured time is by using the sun. They noticed that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, and that it takes about a day for the sun to make one full trip across the sky. So, people started using the sun to measure time in days. \nAnother way that people have measured time is by using the moon. The moon goes through phases, like a full moon and a new moon, and it takes about a month for the moon to go through all of its phases. So, people started using the moon to measure time in months. \nPeople have also used other things to measure time, like water clocks, sand clocks, and clocks with hands. Today, we use all kinds of different clocks and watches to keep track of time. \nIn short, the concept of time has been around for a very long time, and people have used many different things to measure it.",

    "answer": "Dictionaries and bibles often have thin paper because they are designed to be small and portable, and using thin paper allows them to be smaller and lighter. Thin paper also allows more pages to fit into a book, which is important for dictionaries and bibles because they contain a lot of information. \nThe density of the book, or how much information it contains, does not necessarily have a direct relationship with the thickness of the paper. A book with a lot of information can still have thicker paper, and a book with less information can have thin paper. The decision to use thin paper in dictionaries and bibles is often a practical one, based on the desire to make the book as small and portable as possible. \nAs for whether it is a cultural thing, it's possible that certain cultural traditions or preferences may have influenced the decision to use thin paper in dictionaries and bibles.

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why countries don't simply divide their currency by 10 or 100 to get rid of extra zeros. \nFirst, it's important to understand that having a lot of zeros in the value of a currency does not necessarily make it less useful or valuable. The value of a currency is determined by many factors, including the strength of the country's economy and the stability of its political system. \nSecond, divvying up a currency can be a complicated and time-consuming process. It would require changing the value of all prices, wages, and other financial transactions to reflect the new, smaller value of the currency. This could be confusing and disruptive for people and businesses, especially if they have a lot of money saved up in the old currency. \nFinally, dividing a currency by 10 or 100 would likely lead to a significant increase in the number of coins and smaller bills in circulation. This could be inconvenient for people and businesses who have to deal with a lot of small change. \nOverall, while it might seem like an easy solution to get rid of extra zeros in a currency, it's not always practical or desirable for a country to divide its currency.",

    "answer": "Japan is a small country with a large population, which means that it has a lot of people living in a relatively small area. This is one reason why Japan's cities are so densely populated. \nAnother reason is that Japan has a long history of urbanization, with many people living in cities for centuries. This has led to the development of compact, efficient cities that make the most of the available space. In addition, Japan has a strong culture of public transportation, which helps to reduce the need for personal vehicles and makes it easier for people to live in smaller homes and apartments. \nFinally, Japan's mountainous terrain means that there is less flat land available for development, which has also contributed to the country's densely populated cities.

    "question": "Why do men and women have separate restrooms ? Is separate truly equal in this case ? Will society ever reach a point where this becomes an outdated practice ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Men's and women's restrooms are separate because they are designed to accommodate the specific biological needs of each gender. For example, men's restrooms typically have urinals, while women's restrooms typically have stalls with toilets. \nSeparate restrooms can be seen as a way to ensure that everyone has access to the facilities they need in a way that is convenient and private. Some people may feel more comfortable using a restroom that is designated for their gender, particularly if they are transgender or non-binary and may not feel safe using a restroom that does not align with their gender identity. \nIt is possible that society could reach a point where separate restrooms are no longer necessary or desired. Some people believe that gender-neutral restrooms, which are open to people of all genders, could be a more inclusive solution. However, it is important to consider the needs and preferences of all members of society when making decisions about restroom facilities.",

    "answer": "When there is an oil spill, it can be tempting to try to burn the oil because it might seem like an easy way to get rid of the oil and the mess it causes. However, there are a few reasons why burning the oil is not a good solution: \n1. Burning the oil creates air pollution. When the oil is burned, it releases harmful chemicals into the air. These chemicals can be harmful to people, animals, and the environment. \n2. Burning the oil can spread the spill. When the oil is burned, the fire can cause the oil to spread to other areas, which can make the problem even worse. \n3. Burning the oil can cause damage to the environment. The heat from the fire can damage plants and animals in the area, and the smoke from the fire can also harm these living things. \nInstead of burning the oil, it is usually better to try to clean up the spill and remove the oil from the environment. This can be done in a number of ways, such as using special chemicals to break down the oil, using booms to contain the oil, and using absorbent materials to soak up the oil. Cleaning up an oil spill is a big deal because it is important to protect the environment and the living things that depend on it.",

    "answer": "The European settlers didn't die off from native diseases for a few reasons. First, many of the European settlers had already been exposed to similar diseases in Europe, so their bodies were somewhat prepared to fight off the diseases that they encountered in the Americas. Additionally, the European settlers often brought their own diseases with them, such as smallpox, which devastated Native American populations who had never been exposed to these diseases before and had no immunity to them. Finally, the European settlers had access to better medical care and treatments than the Native Americans, which helped them survive illnesses that might have otherwise been fatal.",

    "answer": "The death penalty, also known as capital punishment, is considered by some to be the worst punishment because it involves taking the life of a person as punishment for a crime. Some people believe that this is wrong because they think that every person has the right to life, and that taking someone's life is not an acceptable way to punish them. Other people believe that the death penalty is necessary to protect society and to deter others from committing serious crimes. \nTo be forced to live the rest of your life in jail, also known as a life sentence, can also be a very severe punishment. It means that you will spend the rest of your life in prison, separated from your family and friends, and with very few freedoms. Some people may see this as worse than the death penalty because it means living in prison for a very long time, possibly for the rest of their lives. \nOverall, both the death penalty and a life sentence can be considered very severe punishments, and it is up to each person to decide which one they think is worse.",

These awards can be called things like \"Game of the Year,\" \"Top Game,\" or \"Best Game.\" These organizations and websites have experts who play and review a lot of different games, and then they decide which ones they think are the best based on various criteria, such as graphics, gameplay, story, and innovation. \nIt's important to note that these awards are just opinions, and different people might have different opinions about which games are the best. Also, the titles \"Game of the Year\" or \"Top Game\" are just marketing terms that are meant to highlight the fact that a particular game has received a lot of positive reviews or has won an award. They are not necessarily official titles or certifications. \nIn general, it's always a good idea to do your own research and read reviews from multiple sources before deciding to buy a game.

    "answer": "In some places, people who are in jail are not allowed to vote because they are not considered to be legal residents of the community.

They argue that everyone should have a say in how their community is run, and that people in jail are still affected by the decisions made by the government, even if they are not physically present in the community. \nIt's important to note that the rules around voting rights for people in jail vary from place to place.

    "question": "In WWII , why did the Americans use inferior Sherman tanks ? In every other aspect of the war , Allied technology was superior . Compared to German Tiger tanks , Shermans were outgunned and outarmored . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "So here 's the thing - The Sherman was not really that inferior . This is a myth based on a misinterpretation of history . It was a strong tank , with a reasonable gun and was easy to produce and maintain . Its gun was a little under - powered against late war German tanks but those tanks were rare , and the Sherman 's outnumbered them dramatically . Historians have done extensive analysis of all the tank engagements in World War II and they uncovered one constant truth - * The side that fired first won an overwhelming amount of the time * . It was n't skill , or equipment that decided battles ... it was typically \" who got to shoot first \" . Now consider the situation of World War II where the Sherman actually encountered things like Tigers and Panthers . Let 's set the stage - The Allies are in the attacking role for most of the post D - Day events . They are advancing against the Germans , with the Sherman 's often leading the charge . Arrayed against them are the Germans fighting a primarily defense war . They know the Allies are coming and from where so they have time to set up positions . With the powerful German guns this often means getting highly effective first shots on the advancing Shermans . As a visual example - Watch the \" Tiger \" scene in the movie Fury . The Tiger 's first shot is from cover and is an ambush . From there the Shermans are fighting a Tiger in a battle that the Tiger picked to give it the best shot of victory .",

    "answer": "During World War II, the United States used Sherman tanks because they were relatively cheap and easy to produce in large numbers. The United States was a large and industrial country, and it was able to produce a lot of tanks and other military equipment to support the Allied war effort. \nSherman tanks were not necessarily \"inferior\" to German tanks like the Tiger. While the Tiger was certainly a formidable tank, it was also expensive and time-consuming to produce, which meant that the Germans could not build as many of them as the Americans could build Shermans. In addition, the Sherman tank had some strengths that made it useful in certain situations. For example, it was faster and more maneuverable than the Tiger, which made it better suited for some types of warfare. \nOverall, the use of Sherman tanks by the Americans was a matter of practicality and strategy. The United States needed a large number of tanks that it could produce quickly and inexpensively, and the Sherman tank fit the bill. While it may not have been the most powerful tank on the battlefield, it played a crucial role in the Allied victory in World War II.",

    "answer": "When we mix colors of paint, we are combining different pigments together to create a new color. Pigments are particles of color that are suspended in a liquid medium, such as water or oil. When you mix two pigments together, the particles of color combine to create a new color. For example, when you mix blue paint with yellow paint, the blue and yellow pigments combine to create a green color. \nOn the other hand, when we mix colors of light, we are combining different wavelengths of light together. Light is made up of many different wavelengths, and each wavelength corresponds to a different color. When you mix two colors of light together, the wavelengths of light combine to create a new color. For example, when you mix blue light with yellow light, the wavelengths of light combine to create a white light. \nSo, the reason that mixing colors of paint and mixing colors of light work differently is because they are two different things: pigments and wavelengths of light. When you mix pigments together, you are combining particles of color. When you mix wavelengths of light together, you are combining energy waves.",

    "answer": "Well , yes . Lucifer does n't refer to the Devil as the Devil , it refers to the Angel that fell to create him . Lucifer means \" Morning light \" or \" falling light \" and was supposedly one of the Archangels that fell because God wanted angels to serve humans . Satan is the Abrahamic Devil .

Devil refers to the generic term for the Evil counterpart to God . There is the Abrahamic Devil , Satan . Zoroastrianism has Angra Mainyu , who is the principle of destruction / evil .

There are many different names and titles that have been given to Satan over the years, and these names can have different meanings or connotations depending on the context in which they are used. \nFor example, the name \"Satan\" is derived from a Hebrew word that means \"adversary\" or \"opponent,\" and it is often used to refer to the ultimate embodiment of evil in Abrahamic religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. \nThe name \"Devil\" is another word that is often used to refer to Satan, and it comes from the Greek word \"diabolos,\" which means \"slanderer\" or \"accuser.\" In many traditions, the Devil is depicted as a tempter who tries to lead people astray and convince them to do evil things. \nOther names for Satan include \"Baphomet,\" which is a name that has been associated with Satanism and the occult; \"Beelzebub,\" which is a name that appears in the Hebrew Bible as a name for a demon; and \"Belphagor,\" which is a name that has been used in some legends and myths to refer to a demon or malevolent spirit. \nIt's important to note that these names and titles are often used symbolically or metaphorically, and they may not necessarily represent specific beings or entities.

    "answer": "Water can conduct electricity because it contains ions, which are atoms that have gained or lost electrons and have a positive or negative charge. When water contains a lot of dissolved minerals, it can conduct electricity because the ions in the minerals allow electricity to flow through the water. \nHowever, pure water does not conduct electricity very well because it does not have many ions. This is because the hydrogen atoms in water are bonded to the oxygen atoms through covalent bonds, which do not allow electrons to flow freely. As a result, pure water is a very poor conductor of electricity. \nSo, when you touched a slightly damp iPad charger, the water on your skin may have conducted electricity, which is why you got a bit of a jolt.

Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "There are a few reasons why meteorite fragments are not as valuable or sought after as diamonds and other rare earth minerals. \nFirst, meteorites are much less common than diamonds and other minerals that are found on Earth. While diamonds and other minerals can be mined in large quantities, meteorites are much harder to find and are not found in the same abundance as these other minerals. \nSecond, meteorites are generally not as visually appealing as diamonds and other precious stones. While diamonds and other precious stones have a beautiful sparkle and shine, meteorites tend to be dull and unimpressive in appearance. This makes them less appealing for use in jewelry and other decorative items. \nFinally, meteorites are much harder to work with than diamonds and other precious stones. They are often irregular in shape and can be difficult to cut and polish into the smooth, symmetrical shapes that are desirable in jewelry. This makes them less practical for use in jewelry and other decorative items. \nOverall, while meteorites are certainly interesting and have a unique connection to outer space, they are not as valuable or sought after as diamonds and other precious stones due to their rarity, appearance, and difficulty in working with.",

    "question": "Why do people like alcohol ? I am going to college next year and I know that there will be parties all that , but I just do n't get . Especially something like shots etc . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "There are many different reasons to enjoy alcohol . In moderate doses , it makes you feel more relaxed , it may have some health benefits , it enhances the taste of food ( the right wine pairing is an excellent complement to a good meal ) , it can taste good on itself , etc . Beer is extremely refreshing in a hot day , and can be warming in a cold day , depending on the type of beer . To young people , it is attractive because it can make you feel happier , more confident , and take more risks . This is particularly attractive if you are just learning how to behave socially , need to make friends in a strange place , would like to start dating , need to relieve stress - all common situations in college , especially for freshmen . But I think that there is a distortion , in particular in the US . Alcohol in college becomes more important than it should be because for most of the kids , it has been such a taboo most of their lives . College is the first time that you may find yourself without close supervision and surrounded by people your age who have access to alcohol . Then you turn 21 and suddenly you can legally have the stuff . As a result , most Americans are completely unprepared for this , when the time comes . They do n't know what they like , they do n't know what their limits are , they do n't know how their bodies will react , and they have to deal with peer pressure telling them that drinking is required and that being wasted is desirable fro some reason . Finally , there is a small percentage of the population who are vulnerable to alcohol addiction , which is something that you really do n't want in your life . It 's like most other addictions , except that it is very visible , very public , and very hard to escape . For all these reasons , my suggestion is simply , be careful . Do n't let yourself get carried away . Put a very small limit on yourself . Go to a party , for instance , with the firm limit of 1 beer . No matter how you feel then , do n't push that limit . After you go home and it wears off , think about it and see if it would be wise to raise your limit next time . No matter who you are , though , more then 4 or 5 beers in one event are a bad sign . Stay away from hard liquors as much as you can . If / when you are ready to try , make sure you do it with a group of friends , and that at least one of you is going to be sober . You will eventually get a hangover , inevitably . Remember that if you feel bad , it 's for a reason - you probably pushed your body more than it was able to go . Finally , remember that in large quantities alcohol can kill . Every year there are reports of kids killing themselves in colleges , by drinking too much and not knowing how to deal with it . As a parent , this is one of my biggest fears . So know that it is not normal for someone to drink so much that they pass out . If this happens to someone around you , be a true friend and try to stop them . If you ca n't and they do pass out , try to wake them up . Take them home , give them a shower , have them drink some coffee . They can sleep after they feel better . Most important , if someone has been drinking a lot , passes out , and you ca n't wake them up , please , please call 911 or take them to a hospital . Yes , there will be consequences , but any consequence is better than your friend dying because no one was responsible enough , brave enough to get them help when they need it . be safe .",

    "answer": "There are a variety of reasons why some Cuban Americans may not want the United States to normalize relations with Cuba. \nOne reason may be because they disagree with the political system in Cuba and the actions of the Cuban government. They may believe that normalizing relations would give the Cuban government legitimacy and support their rule. \nAnother reason may be because they or their family members have experienced negative consequences as a result of the Cuban government's actions. For example, they may have been imprisoned or had their property taken away by the government. They may feel that normalizing relations would be a betrayal to those who have suffered under the Cuban government. \nIt's also possible that some Cuban Americans may simply prefer to maintain the existing policy, even if it means limited relations with Cuba. They may feel a strong connection to their Cuban heritage and want to maintain a sense of separation from the Cuban government. \nOverall, the opinions of Cuban Americans on the matter of normalizing relations with Cuba can vary widely and are influenced by a variety of factors, including personal experiences, political beliefs, and cultural connections.",

    "question": "Why do plastic school chairs have holes in the back of them ? Thanks for your knowledge Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Plastic school chairs often have holes in the back of them because they are designed to be lightweight and easy to carry. The holes make the chairs lighter and more comfortable to sit in because they allow air to circulate around the back of the chair. Additionally, the holes can help reduce the amount of heat that builds up in the chair, which can make sitting in the chair for long periods of time more comfortable. Finally, the holes can also help to reduce the amount of material needed to make the chair, which can save money and resources. So, overall, the holes in plastic school chairs are there to make the chairs more comfortable and easier to use.",

    "question": "Will we be able to make giant robots ( like the ones in pacific rim or gundam ) with the technology we have today ? Maybe in my lifetime we can have giant robot battle royales ... Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "the comprehensive answer is that on the modern battlefield ( ever since WWII ) weapons have been superior to armor . Modern tanks survive on the battlefield against anti - tank weapons by being low to the ground and taking advantage of terrain to stay hidden or at least reduce their exposure . Bipedal tanks would have the problem of not being able to take advantage of terrain for safety , and not being able to take advantage of sloping to improve the effectiveness of the armor thickness they can reasonably carry . The only potential advantage of a bipedal tank would be use in a city where they could use buildings as cover . However , even in this situation infantry with anti - tank weapons would have the greater advantage . Finally , for large gundam or pacific rim sized bipedal tanks the surface pressure under their feet would tear huge furrows in the ground . Making them impractical . However , smaller maybe 1 or 2 ton sized powered armor could be highly effective . Offering better protection from small arms while still being able to use terrain for protection from anti - tank weapons .",

    "answer": "Cats are naturally skittish and easily scared because they have evolved to be cautious around potential threats. In the wild, cats need to be constantly alert and ready to defend themselves or flee in order to survive. This instinctual behavior helps them avoid danger and stay alive. \nEven though domestic cats are generally safe from predators, they still have this natural instinct to be cautious and alert. This is why they may startle easily or run away when they hear loud noises or sense movement nearby. \nAs for why domestic cats don't display more dominant traits like their larger cousins (such as lions and tigers), it's important to remember that domestic cats have been domesticated over many generations. This means that they have been bred to be more friendly and social with humans, rather than displaying the more dominant and aggressive behaviors that are common in their wild counterparts. Domestic cats are also generally much smaller and less powerful than larger cats like lions and tigers, so they may not need to rely on dominant behavior as much in order to survive.",

    "answer": "Sloppy math explanation : Let 's say a mattress gets 10 years of life . ( Manufacturer recommendations and consumer behavior both vary between 5 and 10 years ) . Let 's also say that the average person owns one mattress . ( Yes , many couples share , but many also have guest beds ... so let 's stick with one mattress per person to keep the math simple ) . That means , in your town , there are around 100,000 total mattresses in homes , and about 10,000 of them are replaced each year . If there are 20 stores , then each store sells on average 500 mattresses per year , or more than one per day . If it 's an owner operated business with no additional staff , that means he only needs to make $ 200 profit on each mattress ( after rent and other expenses ) in order to have a six - figure income . As others have noted , profit margins are often much higher than that . Another critical factor : Cars , homes and mattresses are about the only things that consumers wo n't buy online , both because shipping is problematic and , more importantly , because they want to actually test it out in person before buying .",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why mattress stores might be able to stay in business, even if there are many of them in a town of around 100,000 people. Here are a few possibilities: \n1. People often need to buy new mattresses for various reasons, such as when they move to a new home, when their old mattress becomes uncomfortable or unsupportive, or when they want to upgrade to a higher-quality mattress. This means that there is a steady demand for mattresses, which can help support multiple mattress stores in a given area. \n2. Mattress stores may offer a wide range of products at different price points, which can appeal to people with different budgets and preferences. For example, some stores may focus on luxury mattresses, while others may offer more affordable options. \n3. Mattress stores may also offer financing options or other promotions, such as discounts or free delivery, to help make their products more accessible to potential customers. \n4. Finally, mattress stores may be able to stay in business by offering good customer service and a helpful shopping experience. For example, they may have knowledgeable sales staff who can help customers find the right mattress for their needs, or they may have comfortable showrooms where customers can test out different mattresses before they make a purchase.",

    "question": "Why do some species ( e.g. salmon ) die after mating once ? What genetic advantage is there in doing so ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "In some species of animals, such as salmon, the females lay eggs and the males fertilize them. After the eggs are fertilized, the males and females may both die. This is called semelparity. \nSemelparity, also known as \"big bang\" reproduction, is a reproductive strategy in which an organism reproduces only once and then dies. This is in contrast to iteroparity, in which an organism reproduces multiple times over the course of its lifetime. \nOne reason why some species may have evolved to reproduce this way is that it can allow them to put all of their energy into producing a large number of offspring at once, rather than spreading their energy out over multiple reproductive events. This can be especially advantageous in environments where conditions are variable and unpredictable, because it allows the organism to take advantage of good conditions when they occur. \nFor example, salmon reproduce in streams and rivers, and the conditions in these habitats can vary significantly from year to year. By reproducing all at once and then dying, salmon can ensure that their offspring will have a good chance of surviving and reproducing, even if conditions become unfavorable in the future. \nOverall, semelparity may not always be the most advantageous reproductive strategy, but it can be beneficial in certain situations.",

    "answer": "Paper toilet seat covers, also known as \"ass gaskets,\" are thin sheets of paper that are placed on top of the toilet seat in a public restroom. The idea behind using these covers is that they can provide a barrier between your skin and the surface of the toilet seat, which may be contaminated with germs or bacteria. Some people believe that using a paper seat cover can help reduce the risk of getting a urinary tract infection (UTI) or other illness from coming into contact with germs on the toilet seat. \nHowever, the effectiveness of paper toilet seat covers as a way to prevent illness is controversial. Some experts believe that paper seat covers may actually be less effective at preventing the spread of germs than simply wiping down the toilet seat with a disinfectant. This is because paper seat covers are often thin and may not provide a complete barrier between your skin and the toilet seat. In addition, paper seat covers can be easily torn or punctured, which could allow germs to come into contact with your skin. \nOverall, it is important to practice good hygiene when using public restrooms, regardless of whether you use a paper toilet seat cover or not. This includes washing your hands thoroughly with soap and water before and after using the bathroom, and avoiding touching your face or other areas of your body while in the bathroom.",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why medical care is generally more expensive in the US than dental care. One reason is that medical care is typically more complex and requires more specialized training and equipment. For example, a surgeon needs to have a lot of education and experience, and they also need to use expensive equipment like MRI machines and operating theaters. This can drive up the cost of medical procedures. \nAnother reason is that there is less competition in the medical field compared to the dental field. There are fewer hospitals and medical centers, and they often have more bargaining power when it comes to setting prices. In contrast, there are many more dentists and dental practices, which can create more competition and drive down prices. \nFinally, there are also different insurance policies and payment systems for medical care and dental care. Medical insurance is often more expensive and covers a wider range of procedures, while dental insurance is usually cheaper and covers a more limited range of procedures. This can also contribute to the difference in prices between medical care and dental care.",

    "answer": "Radiation can be harmful, but it can also be used to treat certain medical conditions. When used in the right way, radiation can help kill cancer cells or shrink tumors. It can also be used to treat other conditions, like an overactive thyroid gland or certain types of blood disorders. \nRadiation works by damaging the DNA inside cells. This makes it hard for the cells to grow and divide, which can help kill cancer cells or shrink tumors. Normal cells can also be damaged by radiation, but they are usually able to repair themselves. Cancer cells, on the other hand, may not be able to repair themselves as well, which is why radiation can be effective at killing them. \nWhen doctors use radiation to treat someone, they carefully plan the treatment to make sure that the right amount of radiation is used in the right place. They also try to protect normal cells as much as possible to minimize side effects. Even with these precautions, side effects can still happen, and that's why radiation is usually only used when the benefits outweigh the risks.",

    "answer": "Old English and modern English are considered the same language because they are both descended from a common ancestor, which is called Proto-Indo-European. This ancestor language was spoken by ancient people who lived in Europe thousands of years ago. Over time, the language has changed and evolved, and different versions of it have developed in different parts of the world. \nOld English, also known as Anglo-Saxon, is the earliest form of the English language that we have written records of. It was spoken in England from about the 5th to the 12th century. It is called \"Old English\" because it is no longer spoken or used today, but it is still an important part of the history and development of the English language. \nModern English, on the other hand, is the form of English that is spoken and written today. It has evolved from Old English and has been influenced by a number of other languages, including French, Latin, and various Germanic languages. While Old English and modern English may seem very different at first glance, they are actually closely related and share a common ancestry. \nIn summary, Old English and modern English are considered the same language because they both come from the same ancestor language, and they have evolved and changed over time.",

    "answer": "There are several reasons why the United States has seen such a dramatic increase in its prison population while other Western countries have seen a decline. \nOne reason is that the United States has a higher rate of crime than many other Western countries. This means that more people in the United States are being arrested and charged with crimes, which leads to more people being imprisoned. \nAnother reason is that the United States has tougher sentencing laws than many other Western countries. For example, the United States has longer mandatory minimum sentences for certain crimes, which means that people who are convicted of those crimes must serve a minimum amount of time in prison. \nFinally, the United States also has a higher rate of recidivism, or the tendency for people who have been released from prison to commit new crimes and end up back in prison. This can contribute to the overall prison population remaining high. \nOverall, the United States has a complex and multifaceted criminal justice system that has contributed to the high rate of imprisonment in the country.",

    "answer": "Cancer is a complex disease that can be difficult to treat, even when we know how it starts and how it spreads. There are several reasons why we have not been able to eliminate cancer entirely: \n1. Cancer cells are very good at evading our body's natural defenses. They are able to hide from the immune system and continue to grow and spread. \n2. Cancer cells are also very good at adapting and changing, which makes it difficult for treatments to effectively target and kill them. \n3. Different types of cancer can behave very differently, and what works for one type of cancer may not work for another. This means that researchers and doctors have to come up with different approaches and treatments for each type of cancer. \n4. Early detection and treatment of cancer is important, but it is not always possible to catch cancer in its early stages. Some types of cancer do not have obvious symptoms until they have already advanced, which can make them more difficult to treat. \n5. Finally, cancer research is a very complex and time-consuming process. It takes a lot of effort and resources to develop new treatments and to test them to make sure they are safe and effective. \nOverall, timing of treatment is just one factor that can affect the success of cancer treatment.

    "answer": "Swear words, also known as profanity or obscenities, are words that are considered offensive or taboo because they are generally considered to be rude, vulgar, or insulting. The origins of swear words can be traced back to the earliest human societies, where certain words and phrases were used to express strong emotions or to convey disrespect or aggression. \nOne theory is that swear words originally evolved as a way for people to vent their anger or frustration without physically harming others. Swearing may have also served as a way to bond with others and build solidarity, as people who swore together may have been seen as belonging to the same social group. \nOver time, certain words and phrases came to be considered inappropriate or offensive in many cultures and societies, and using them in public or in polite conversation became taboo. In some cases, this may be due to the words being associated with particular groups or activities that are considered taboo or shameful. In other cases, the taboo nature of certain words may simply be due to their association with strong emotions or with disrespectful or aggressive behavior. \nIn general, it is considered rude to use swear words in public or in polite conversation because they can be offensive or disturbing to others, and because they can reflect poorly on the person using them. However, there is often a great deal of cultural and personal variation in what is considered to be a swear word, and what is considered acceptable language.",

    "answer": "Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system. It can be thought of as a way to describe the amount of uncertainty or randomness in a system. \nHere's an example to help explain entropy: Imagine you have a jar with 10 red marbles and 10 blue marbles. The jar is organized, with all the red marbles on one side and all the blue marbles on the other side. In this case, the jar has low entropy because everything is very organized and there is little uncertainty about where the marbles are. \nNow imagine that you shake the jar up, so that the marbles are mixed together. Now it is difficult to predict where any individual marble will be when you reach into the jar. In this case, the jar has high entropy because there is a lot of randomness and uncertainty about where the marbles are. \nIn thermodynamics, entropy is often used to describe the randomness or disorder of a system at the molecular level. For example, when a gas is allowed to expand, the molecules will spread out and become more disordered, resulting in an increase in entropy. Similarly, when a substance is cooled, the molecules will slow down and become more organized, resulting in a decrease in entropy. \nI hope this helps to give you a basic understanding of entropy!

That energy can cause biological damage and is therefore dangerous ( especially if ingested ) .",

    "question": "How does radioactivity work If radioactivity is a decaying atom . What is left behind at sites like chernobyl . What causes some atoms or isotopes of atoms to be radioactive while others are not ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Radioactivity is the process by which an atom becomes unstable and releases energy as it decays into a more stable form. This happens because the nucleus of the atom, which is made up of protons and neutrons, is not perfectly balanced. Some atoms, called isotopes, are more stable than others because they have a different number of protons and neutrons in their nucleus. \nWhen an atom is radioactive, it means that the nucleus is unstable and will eventually break apart, or decay. This process releases energy and sometimes particles, such as alpha particles or beta particles, which are types of radiation. \nAt sites like Chernobyl, what is left behind after the radioactive atoms decay is called nuclear waste. This waste is still radioactive and can be dangerous to people and the environment if it is not properly stored and handled. \nNot all atoms or isotopes are radioactive. Some isotopes are stable and do not decay, while others are only slightly radioactive and take a very long time to decay. The stability of an atom or isotope depends on the balance of protons and neutrons in its nucleus. If there are too many or too few of either one, the atom can become unstable and start to decay.",

    "question": "Why was HIV / AIDS blamed on the homosexual community in the early stages of its discovery ? Please by respectful in your answers . Thanks ! Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, was first identified in the 1980s, and in the early years of the epidemic, it was primarily associated with the gay, bisexual, and transgender communities. This association was largely due to the fact that HIV was initially identified in these communities and because it was primarily spread through sexual contact. However, it is important to note that HIV and AIDS do not discriminate and can affect anyone, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. \nIt is also important to recognize that the initial response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic was not always informed or compassionate. There was a lot of fear and misunderstanding surrounding the disease, and some people responded with stigma and discrimination towards those who were affected by it. This included blaming and shaming the gay community, even though HIV and AIDS can affect anyone, regardless of their sexual orientation. \nIt is important to remember that HIV and AIDS are serious public health issues that require understanding, education, and compassion, rather than fear and discrimination.",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why it might be difficult for Reddit to keep the site from crashing: \n1. Traffic: Reddit is a very popular website, with millions of users visiting the site every day. This can put a lot of strain on the servers and infrastructure that support the site, which can make it more prone to crashing. \n2. Complexity: Reddit is a very complex website, with many different features and functions. This complexity can make it more difficult to maintain the site and keep it running smoothly. \n3. Bugs: Like any software, Reddit can have bugs or other issues that can cause the site to crash. Fixing these bugs can take time, especially if they are hard to identify or reproduce. \nAs for buying gold, that is a separate issue. Gold is a precious metal that has been used as a form of currency and a store of value for centuries. Some people buy gold as a way to diversify their investment portfolio or as a hedge against inflation. However, the stability of Reddit has no direct impact on the value of gold or the decision to buy it.",

    "answer": "Your skin contains molecules that can be synthesized into vitamin D when they 're exposed to ultraviolet light .

    "question": "How does getting vitamin D through sunlight work ? I 've been told for years that sunlight exposure is a good source of vitamin D. How is it that vitamin D can be received through sunlight when other vitamins have to be ingested ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Vitamin D is a special vitamin that your body can make on its own when your skin is exposed to sunlight. It's not like other vitamins that you have to get from the food you eat. \nWhen sunlight hits your skin, a chemical called 7-dehydrocholesterol is turned into vitamin D. Your body then uses vitamin D to help absorb calcium, which is important for strong bones and teeth. \nSo, to get vitamin D from sunlight, you just need to spend some time outside with your skin exposed to the sun. This is especially important during the summer months, when the sun is strongest. You don't need to spend a long time in the sun, just a few minutes a day can be enough. \nIt's also important to remember to wear sunscreen when you're outside to protect your skin from the sun's harmful rays. But don't worry, you can still get enough vitamin D even if you're wearing sunscreen. Just make sure to spend a little extra time in the sun if you're using sunscreen.",

    "answer": "During sleep, your body goes into a state of muscle paralysis called \"sleep paralysis.\" This is a normal part of the sleep cycle and it helps to prevent you from acting out your dreams and potentially harming yourself. When you are in the state of sleep paralysis, you may feel like you cannot move or speak, but this is only temporary and will pass as you continue to sleep. It is not uncommon for people to experience vivid dreams and sensations while in the state of sleep paralysis, and some people may even feel like they are rolling around in bed or moving in some other way, even though their body is still paralyzed. \nIt is also possible that you were not actually in a state of sleep paralysis when you woke up hanging off your bed. It could be that you simply moved around in your sleep and ended up in that position. Some people are more active in their sleep and may move around more than others. If you are concerned about your sleep habits or have experienced episodes of sleep paralysis, it may be a good idea to speak with a healthcare professional for further evaluation and guidance.",

    "answer": "Allergies are a type of immune system reaction that occurs when the body mistakes a normally harmless substance, such as pollen or peanuts, for a harmful invader. When this happens, the body releases chemicals called histamines in an attempt to protect itself, which can cause symptoms like sneezing, itchy eyes, and trouble breathing. \nIt's not clear why some people develop allergies and others don't. It's thought that a combination of genetic and environmental factors may play a role. For example, people who have a family history of allergies may be more likely to develop them, and certain environmental exposures (such as being exposed to cigarette smoke or pollution) may also increase the risk. \nIt's also not clear whether allergies are beneficial or not. Some scientists believe that allergies may have evolved as a way to protect against certain parasites or infections, but this is still an area of active research and debate. \nThere are some potential benefits to having allergies, such as increased sensitivity to certain substances or a heightened immune response. However, allergies can also be very disruptive to daily life and can cause significant discomfort or even be life-threatening in severe cases.",

    "answer": "Energy drink companies use caffeine because it is a legal and safe stimulant that is widely available and has been extensively studied. Caffeine is a stimulant that can help to increase alertness and improve mental and physical performance. It is also relatively inexpensive to obtain and use in energy drinks. \nEphedrine is a stimulant that is similar to caffeine, but it is not as widely available and is not as well-studied. It has also been linked to some potential negative side effects, such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, and it is not legal for use in dietary supplements in many countries. \nModafinil is a prescription medication that is used to treat narcolepsy, a condition that causes excessive daytime sleepiness. It is not typically used in energy drinks because it is a prescription medication and is not legal to sell or use without a prescription. \nIn summary, energy drink companies use caffeine because it is a legal and safe stimulant that is widely available and has been extensively studied, while other stimulants like ephedrine and modafinil may not be as widely available or have as much research to support their use, and may also have potential negative side effects or be subject to legal restrictions.",

    "answer": "Animals and humans can both be affected by radiation from a nuclear disaster. However, animals may be able to survive in contaminated areas because they have different ways of coping with radiation. For example, some animals may be able to avoid areas that are highly contaminated, while others may have physical characteristics that help protect them from the effects of radiation. \nOne reason why humans may have a harder time living in contaminated areas is because we are more sensitive to the effects of radiation. Our bodies are more vulnerable to the damaging effects of radiation, and we are more likely to develop health problems as a result of being exposed to high levels of radiation. \nIn addition, humans rely on technology and infrastructure to survive, and these can be disrupted or damaged by a nuclear disaster. This can make it difficult for us to access the resources we need to survive, such as food, water, and shelter. \nOverall, it's important to remember that both animals and humans can be affected by radiation, and it's important to take steps to protect ourselves and the environment from the harmful effects of nuclear disasters.",

    "answer": "Vomiting can be a common side effect of taking vitamins on an empty stomach, especially if the vitamins are in pill or capsule form. This can happen because the vitamins can irritate the lining of the stomach, causing it to feel uncomfortable or upset. \nWhen you eat food, it helps to coat the lining of the stomach and can make it easier for your body to tolerate the vitamins. When you take vitamins on an empty stomach, there is nothing there to help protect the stomach, so the vitamins can irritate it more easily. \nIf you are experiencing this issue, you may want to try taking your vitamins with food or with a small snack to see if that helps. You can also try taking liquid vitamins or chewable vitamins, as these may be easier for your body to tolerate.

    "answer": "Preordering games is a practice in which a customer pays for a game in advance of its release, sometimes receiving certain bonuses or perks for doing so. Some gamers have become opposed to preordering games for a variety of reasons. One reason is that it can be risky to preorder a game, because there is no way to know for certain whether the game will be good or not until it is actually released. If the game turns out to be disappointing, the customer who preordered it may feel like they wasted their money. \nAnother reason some gamers are against preordering is that it can create unnecessary pressure on game developers to meet certain deadlines or targets, which can lead to rushed or unfinished products. This can lead to a lower quality product and a less enjoyable gaming experience. \nFinally, some gamers believe that preordering games takes money away from smaller, independent game developers and instead supports larger, established companies. By not preordering games, gamers can show support for smaller developers and help promote diversity in the gaming industry. \nOverall, the decision to preorder a game is a personal one, and gamers may choose to do so for a variety of reasons, including to get bonus content or to show support for a particular game or developer.

    "question": "What is the Mars One missions to Mars and is it really possible and going to happen ? Do they have the funding , technology , proper sanity , ect Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Hey there , aerospace engineer here who has experience in the space industry , and with college level mission design and analysis specifically oriented towards manned Mars missions . Mars one does not have the funding , technology , resources , time , scientific understanding , or technical acumen needed to pull off a mission of the caliber they are proposing . For their mission to succeed , several major things will need to change ; most are completely outside of the organization 's control . First , they will need an exorbitant amount of funds . Their projected plan is to use around $ 6 billion . Not only is this a ludicrously small amount , it 's a pretty sure sign of just how serious their program is ( not at all ) . As a conservative estimate , $ 20 billion is probably a better first guess for development of a Mars surface habitat capable of sustaining 4 people for a number of years . Cost drivers include a complete lack of appropriate Mars EDL ( entry , decent , and landing ) capabilities for large cargo , lack of a properly secured life support and resource utilization loop , launch and in space propulsion costs ( which alone would cost more than their projected mission costs to put several dozen tons of cargo on Mars ) , and other similarly large obstacles that require a good deal of funding well before their company will be able to sell the media rights to anyone ( and as far as I , or anyone else in the public is aware , no one is interested in buying to the tune of $ 6 + billion ) . Technology , science , and R & D : as I 've already pointed out , there are huge technical gaps left to completing a Mars mission , even ignoring the whole \" bring your astronauts home \" problem . Launch costs , Mars EDL , and life support are only the most visible and ( probably ) most costly examples . There are a huge variety of additional technical hurdles that Mars one has made little to no effort to adequately address . No human has ever spend more than a few days in an environment between 1 and 0 g 's . No one has created ISRU capabilities that are ready for industrial use and consumption on Mars . No one has used machines to remotely construct a habitat in a space - like environment , beyond self constructing satellites . No one has built structures on Mars ; the long term corrosive and erosive effects are not understood or adequately modelable on Earth . No one has sampled Martian soil , or measured it 's effects as a possible radiation shield ; without knowing how effective it is , it 's impossible to determine how much needs to be used to safely accommodate your astronauts , and thus how strong your structure needs to be to support it . No one has studied the psychological effects operating on astronauts embarking on known one way missions ; it is difficult to predict how team dynamics will play out , and how the astronaut 's sanity and productivity will be impacted . I could go on , but I think the point is clear . As far as time goes , their proposed schedule is as questionable as their budget , if not more so . With an initial funding of less than a few million dollars , they plan to have a custom built rover designed , built , launched , and to land on Mars by the early 2020 's . Let that sink in for a moment . This sort of endeavor takes many millions of dollars , and years just to develop . Their reason for optimism ? That they are going to reuse designs . To anyone who 's worked in the space program , this is a dubious way to save time and money . While it 's certainly better than starting from scratch ( in some cases ) , entire aspects of the rover 's design will always need to be re - examined , re built , re optimized , re analyzed , and re assessed for their impacts on the surrounding structure . I ca n't go to Lockheed Martin and buy another Mars rover , for buy one get one free . These things are n't bicycles , they are some of the most complicated pieces of robotic equipment designed and built . Testing alone takes years , unless you have the money to burn and risk to take to accelerate the schedule . And again , almost all of their proposed structures are going to need to be designed , redesigned , built , tested , redesigned , rebuilt , and retested from scratch , over many years and for billions of dollars . Their assessment of and relationship to the aerospace industry is also questionable . A true development plan does not consist of \" We will pay companies to design and build components to meet our needs \" . You ca n't go to one company , pay for a Mars rover to build your habitat , then go to another and pay for a habitat , then get to Mars and expect them to work together . You need teamwork , integration , cross compatible requirements and design considerations , communication between organizations concerned about intellectual property , profits , and competition , systems level testing and program management , clear program driving factors , and everything else that goes into making a mission like Apollo or ISS or Skylab work . To give one more , truly solid idea of just how unrealistic their plans are , consider this . To get to the moon on Apollo 8 , three astronauts launched atop a Saturn V in an Apollo CSM . The command / service module had a mass of almost 30 metric tons . It could support three astronauts for two weeks , with around 2 cubic meters of space for each astronaut . At the end of that journey , it was discarded . It had no ability to recycle food or water or air , or generate power . And it was launched on that journey by the Saturn V , the largest rocket ever to launch humans into space , a rocket that had more than twice the payload capacity of the Falcon Heavy , Mars one 's proposed launch vehicle . It took the full force of the US government , spending billions of dollars a year for almost a decade , to build the capabilities to travel to the moon , and the tools , engineering base , and equipment involved . Have spacecraft come significantly further in the intervening decades ? Yes . Has our understanding of the problems involved with a Mars mission ? Yes . Are we considerably more ready to tackle the challenge ? Yes . But that does n't change the fundamental variables : you need mass . You need time . You need money . You need expertise . You need launchers . You need organization , skill , planning , coordination , and a bureaucratic machine built to handle the legal , regulatory , ethical , and political ramifications of the mission you are undertaking . These are the things Mars one lacks ; not ideas or enthusiasm or spirit , but manpower and money and influence .",

    "question": "How do insects survive the winter ? Over winter they just disappear , so where do they go ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Winter survival strategy varies wildly between insect species . Some ( Monarch butterflies ) move south for the winter , even if it takes several generations of insects to actually complete the trip . Some ( cicadas ) lay eggs and the species survives as an egg or larvae in a protected location . Some ( ants ) simply withdraw to a secure location and wait it out , re - emerging when the weather starts to turn .",

    "question": "How do insects survive the winter ? Over winter they just disappear , so where do they go ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Insects have many different ways of surviving the winter, depending on the species and the conditions in their environment. Some insects, like ladybugs and monarch butterflies, migrate to a warmer place for the winter. They fly to a new location where they can find food and shelter until the weather gets warmer again. \nOther insects, like bees and ants, stay in their nests or hives and huddle together to keep warm. They may also store food to eat during the winter when there isn't as much to find outside. \nSome insects, like moths and butterflies, lay their eggs in the fall, and the eggs hatch into larvae or caterpillars in the spring. The larvae then grow into adult insects and emerge when the weather gets warmer. \nOther insects, like ladybugs and praying mantises, go into a state of dormancy during the winter. This means that they stop moving and become very still, almost like they are sleeping. They are able to do this because their bodies are able to slow down their metabolism and use very little energy until the weather gets warm again. \nSo, insects have many different ways of surviving the winter, but they all have to find a way to stay warm, find food, and avoid predators until the weather gets warm again.",

    "question": "Why does Japan have such bizarre pornography ? Edit to clarify question : What are the social factors which cause the strange porn ? Also , why so much pubic hair ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "It's not accurate or fair to say that Japan has particularly \"bizarre\" pornography. Like in any country, there is a range of pornography that is produced and consumed in Japan, and the content of this material varies greatly. There is no single explanation for why some pornography produced in Japan may be perceived as strange or unusual to some people. \nIt's also important to note that pornography is a form of media that is meant to be sexually suggestive or arousing. It is not necessarily intended to reflect real-life relationships or sexual practices. Therefore, it is not appropriate to try to draw conclusions about a society's attitudes towards sex or relationships based on the content of its pornography. \nAs for the presence of pubic hair in Japanese pornography, this is a matter of personal preference and can vary from one individual to another. Some people may prefer to leave their pubic hair unshaved, while others may prefer to shave it. There is no one \"correct\" way to groom pubic hair and what is considered attractive can vary from one culture to another.",

    "question": "Why do posts from default subs like nosleep , philosophy , etc . reach the top pages when they only have ~50 upvotes ? Do these subs have \" guaranteed \" positions in the top 100 , etc ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Posts from default subreddits like nosleep and philosophy don't necessarily reach the top pages just because they are from default subreddits. Reddit's algorithms for determining what appears on the top pages take into account a variety of factors, such as the number of upvotes a post has received, the age of the post, and the engagement the post has received (e.g., comments, shares). \nIt's also important to note that the top pages of a subreddit are not the same as the front page of the entire site. The front page is a collection of the most popular posts from across all of Reddit, while the top pages of a subreddit are the most popular posts within that specific subreddit. So, even if a post from a default subreddit doesn't make it to the front page, it could still be very popular within its own subreddit and appear on the top pages of that subreddit. \nI hope that helps!

    "answer": "A line is a one-dimensional object because it has only one measure of length. It extends infinitely in two directions, but it has no width or thickness. A point is an even simpler object that has no dimensions at all. It has no length, width, or thickness. \nImagine a line drawn on a piece of paper. The line goes on and on, but it only takes up a certain amount of space on the paper. It has one dimension, which is its length. Now imagine a dot drawn on the same piece of paper. The dot is even smaller than the line and takes up even less space on the paper. The dot has no dimensions at all because it has no length, width, or thickness. \nI hope that helps to clarify things!

    "answer": "Michelin is a company that is best known for making tires, but it also publishes a series of guides that rate restaurants, hotels, and other types of travel-related businesses. The guides are called the Michelin Guide, and they are widely regarded as some of the most prestigious and respected guides in the world. \nThe Michelin Guide started as a way to help people who were traveling by car find good places to eat and stay. The company's founders, Andr\u00e9 and \u00c9douard Michelin, believed that if they could help people have a better experience while traveling, they would be more likely to buy Michelin tires. \nThe Michelin Guide rates restaurants using a system of stars. One star means that the restaurant is \"a very good restaurant in its category,\" two stars mean that it is \"excellent cooking, worth a detour,\" and three stars mean that it is \"exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey.\" Restaurants that earn three stars are considered some of the best in the world. \nPeople care about what the Michelin Guide thinks about restaurants because they believe that the guide's ratings are a good way to find high-quality places to eat. If a restaurant has a lot of stars, it means that the food is probably really good and that the restaurant is worth visiting.",

    "answer": "Human beings are omnivorous, which means that we eat both plants and animals. Many other animals are also omnivorous, but some are herbivorous (only eat plants) and others are carnivorous (only eat meat). \nOne reason why we have to cook our food is that cooking can make it easier for our bodies to digest and absorb the nutrients in the food. Cooking can also kill harmful bacteria and parasites that can cause illness or infection if we eat raw or undercooked food. \nOur digestive system is well-suited to processing a wide range of foods, including both plant and animal sources. However, it is not as strong as the digestive systems of some other animals that have evolved to eat a more specialized diet. For example, some carnivorous animals have much stronger stomach acids than humans, which helps them to break down raw meat and bones. \nIt is generally not safe for humans to eat raw meat because it can contain harmful bacteria or parasites that can cause illness. Raw or undercooked meat can also contain toxins that can be harmful to humans. It is important to cook meat thoroughly to kill any harmful bacteria or parasites and to reduce the risk of food poisoning.",

    "answer": "Oil spills can happen for a variety of reasons, and it can be difficult to completely eliminate the risk of an oil spill occurring. For example, oil spills can occur due to human error, such as when a ship captain makes a mistake while navigating or when a worker at an oil refinery mishandles equipment. Oil spills can also occur due to equipment failure, such as when a pipe or tanker ship develops a leak. \nThere are measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of oil spills, such as improving the design of oil transport vessels and pipelines, training workers to follow safety protocols, and implementing emergency response plans to quickly contain and clean up spills when they do occur. However, it can be challenging to completely eliminate the risk of an oil spill, especially given the complexity of the systems involved in the transport and processing of oil.",

    "answer": "In movies and in real life, soldiers are usually told not to fire their weapons until they are close enough to the enemy because it increases the chances of hitting their target. When a person shoots a gun, the bullet travels through the air and can be affected by things like wind, gravity, and other forces. The farther away the target is, the more time the bullet has to be affected by these forces, which can make it more difficult to hit the target. \nSo, if a soldier is too far away from the enemy, their bullets might not hit the enemy even if they are aiming at them. This is why it's important to wait until the soldier is close enough to the enemy before firing their weapon. This way, the bullet has less time to be affected by external forces and is more likely to hit the target. \nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

    "answer": "Democrats want to put money into social programs . They believe that given the chance , most people will work . However there are a significant percentage of people who are not working because of issues surrounding education , child care , health or other aspects of being poor . Essentially they want to \" help people up , so they can get back to work \" Getting more people to work will improve their quality of life AND bring in additional tax money ( because working people pay more taxes ) .

They think that if you give money to people who are not working , you create an incentive to be a lazy ass . They think that if you make it harsher to be poor , fewer people will want to be poor and therefore more people will work . They also feel that if you give tax breaks to the wealthy then those wealthy people will use that money to invest in businesses who will turn that investment into jobs .

    "answer": "In the United States, the Republican Party and the Democratic Party are two major political parties that have different ideas about how to address economic issues. Here is a general overview of some of the main differences in economic policy between the two parties: \nRepublicans: \nTend to support lower taxes, especially for businesses and high-income earners. They believe that lower taxes will stimulate economic growth and create jobs.\nTend to support smaller government and fewer regulations. They believe that the government should not interfere too much in the economy and that businesses should be free to operate as they see fit.\nTend to support free trade and global economic integration. They believe that free trade helps to increase economic efficiency and create wealth. \nDemocrats: \nTend to support higher taxes, especially for businesses and high-income earners. They believe that higher taxes are necessary to fund important government programs and reduce income inequality.\nTend to support larger government and more regulations. They believe that the government has a role in regulating the economy to protect workers and the environment, and to ensure that all Americans have access to basic services like healthcare and education.\nTend to support more protectionist trade policies and a greater emphasis on domestic production. They believe that these policies can help to create and protect American jobs. \nWhen it comes to international economic policy, both parties generally support policies that promote economic growth and stability around the world. However, they may have different ideas about how to achieve these goals. For example, Republicans may prioritize free trade and economic integration, while Democrats may prioritize domestic economic growth and the protection of American jobs.",

    "question": "How can film editors remove green screen through an actors hair ? Here is an example : URL_0 Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Green screen technology is used in film and video production to allow filmmakers to superimpose one video clip over another. It works by filming a subject in front of a green or blue background, which can then be removed in post-production and replaced with any other desired image or video. \nTo remove the green screen from an actor's hair, film editors can use a technique called \"chroma keying.\" This involves using specialized software to select the green (or blue) color in the background and \"key it out,\" or remove it from the image. The software looks for pixels in the image that match the color of the green screen, and then removes them, replacing them with a transparent area. \nOnce the green screen has been removed, the editor can then add in a new background image or video behind the actor. This allows filmmakers to create the illusion that the actor is in a completely different location or environment, even if they were actually filmed in front of a plain green or blue screen. \nI hope this explanation helps!

    "answer": "In real life, it is possible for people, including police officers, to quickly memorize a license plate number under stressful circumstances. This is because the human brain is capable of rapidly processing and committing important information to memory when it is necessary. \nOne way that police officers might be able to quickly memorize a license plate number is by using a technique called \"chunking.\" This involves breaking the long string of numbers and letters on the license plate into smaller, more manageable chunks that are easier to remember. For example, a license plate number might be broken up into three chunks: ABC-123, XYZ-456, or something similar. By breaking the information into chunks, the brain can more easily process and retain it. \nAnother way that police officers might be able to quickly memorize a license plate number is by using visual imagery. For example, they might associate the numbers and letters on the license plate with familiar objects or images. This can help make the information more memorable and easier to recall. \nOverall, being able to quickly memorize a license plate number under stressful circumstances is a skill that can be developed through training and practice.

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why companies might hire foreign people to do technical or customer support. One reason is that it can be less expensive to hire workers in other countries, especially if the cost of living is lower there. For example, if a company is based in a country with a high cost of living, it might be able to save money by hiring workers in a country with a lower cost of living. \nAnother reason is that there may be a shortage of qualified candidates in the company's home country, or the company may have difficulty finding people with the necessary skills or experience. In these cases, the company may look to other countries to find the talent it needs. \nWhile it's true that language barriers can sometimes be a challenge when working with foreign technical or customer support staff, many companies provide language training or hire staff who are fluent in the language used by their customers. Additionally, advances in technology, such as translation software, can also help to bridge language gaps. \nOverall, companies hire foreign workers for technical or customer support for a variety of reasons, including cost savings and access to a larger pool of qualified candidates.

    "answer": "Animals, including dogs, are able to hear a wider range of frequencies than humans. They also have a more finely tuned sense of hearing, which allows them to pick up on sounds that we may not be able to hear. This is why your dog may be able to hear your voice or other sounds while sleeping, but may not react to music or other digital sounds. \nOne reason for this is that animals are more sensitive to sounds that are associated with potential threats or dangers. For example, a dog may be more likely to wake up if they hear the sound of someone approaching or talking, because these sounds could indicate the presence of a potential threat. On the other hand, music and other digital sounds may not be as closely associated with potential threats, so the dog may not react to them as readily. \nIt's also possible that your dog may have become accustomed to hearing music while they are sleeping, and has learned to ignore it as a result. Dogs are highly adaptable and can quickly learn to associate certain stimuli with positive or negative experiences. If your dog has had positive experiences while music was playing, they may be more likely to ignore it, even if it is played loudly. \nIn general, it's important to remember that every animal is different and may react differently to different stimuli. Some dogs may be more sensitive to sounds than others, and may be more likely to wake up in response to music or other digital sounds. Similarly, some dogs may be more resilient and may be able to sleep through loud noises that would wake up other dogs.",

    "answer": "Super glue is a type of adhesive that is made up of a liquid chemical called cyanoacrylate. It is a very strong adhesive that can bond many different materials together, including plastic, metal, and glass. \nOne reason that super glue sticks to most surfaces is because it can chemically bond with the molecules on the surface of the material. When the glue comes into contact with the surface, it starts to harden and form a strong bond. \nHowever, the inside of the glue bottle is made of a special type of plastic that does not allow the glue to bond with it. This is because the plastic is coated with a special chemical that prevents the glue from sticking to it. \nAs for why super glue does not work in outer space, it's because there is no oxygen present in space. Super glue needs oxygen to harden and form a strong bond, so without oxygen, the glue cannot harden and it will not work properly. \nI hope this helps to explain why super glue sticks to most surfaces but not to the inside of the glue bottle, and why it does not work in outer space.",

    "answer": "In the Christian tradition, Jesus is believed to be the son of God and the fulfillment of ancient Jewish prophecies. One of these prophecies, found in the Hebrew Bible, states that the Messiah, or savior, would be descended from the line of King David. Because Mary was engaged to be married to Joseph at the time of Jesus' conception and birth, it was traditionally believed that Joseph was Jesus' legal father and that Jesus inherited his royal lineage through Joseph. \nThis belief is based on the idea that in ancient times, a person's family and ancestry were traced through the father's side. So even though Jesus and Joseph were not biologically related, Jesus was considered to be part of the family of Joseph and therefore part of the royal line of King David. \nIt's important to note that this belief about Jesus' ancestry is based on tradition and faith, and it is not a scientific or historical fact.",

It is often compared to cinemas in the advertising while forgetting to mention the difference in size and exaggerated curve of the TV .

Unless you 're sitting directly in front of the TV ( dead center ) with the viewing spacing taking up your peripheral vision you will see a distorted curve .

    "question": "What does \" the curve \" even do in Samsung 's new TV ? Why does it matter ? It just seems pointless ... Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The curve on a Samsung TV refers to the shape of the screen. Some Samsung TVs have screens that are curved, meaning they have a slight inward or outward curve to them. The curve of the screen is designed to provide a more immersive viewing experience, as it can make the screen feel larger and more surrounding. \nThere are a few reasons why the curve on a Samsung TV might matter to some people. First, the curve of the screen can help to reduce distortion and improve the overall image quality of the TV. This is because the curve of the screen helps to align the pixels on the screen more evenly, which can help to reduce image distortion and improve the overall picture quality. \nSecond, the curve of the screen can also make the TV feel more immersive and surround-like, as it can give the impression of the screen wrapping around your field of vision. This can be especially helpful for people who enjoy watching movies or TV shows on their TV and want to feel more immersed in the content. \nOverall, the curve on a Samsung TV is a design feature that can enhance the viewing experience for some people by improving image quality and providing a more immersive viewing experience. However, it is not necessary for everyone and some people may prefer a flat screen TV instead.",

    "question": "How does city zoning work in London ? For example , Camden is a borough in the city of Westminster which itself is in the city of London . How is it that a city exists within a city ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Lifelong Londoner here . I 'll try to explain . First , you have one outright mistake in your question , and a couple of points of confusion . The outright mistake is this : \" Camden is a borough in the city of Westminster \" . No , it is n't . So let 's try to clarify . \" Greater London \" is a geographic and political entity . It 's approximately 600 square miles in size and has a population of around 8.5 million people . Certain functions , such as transport and many development and economic issues , are considered important enough that there is an elected mayor for the whole of Greater London ( known , unsurprisingly , as the Mayor of London , but we 'll come back to this ) , and an elected body , the Greater London Assembly , which between them set policies . The Mayor and GLA also provide the budget for the police and fire service in London , and have a say in their running . To provide more local representation and deal with less London - wide issues , Greater London is then subdivided into 33 boroughs . One of these boroughs is the London Borough of Camden , another is the London Borough of the City of Westminster ( we 'll come to the reason for it having \" city \" in its name later ) . But Camden and Westminster are completely separate entities ; apart from the fact that they 're both one of the 33 boroughs they have nothing else in common . Most of the boroughs have an official name of \" The London Borough of * whatever * \" but a couple are called \" The City of * whatever * \" . This is because the history of human settlement in the London area dates way , way , back , long before the establishment of Greater London . For example the city of Westminster grew up from about the 10th century , so as the area that was later called London grew it was eventually swallowed up . The borough retains the name of what was once a separate , independent city , however . And then there 's the borough called \" The City of London \" . This one is special in many ways . The City of London ( the word \" City \" is * * always * * spelt with a capital in this context ) is tiny . It 's only about one square mile in size . It 's essentially the area that once sat within the old Roman walls of their city of * Londinium * , and today it 's completely dominated by being the headquarters of many financial companies -- so much so that in the UK simply saying \" The City \" is a shorthand way of saying \" financial services companies \" , just as in the US saying \" Wall Street \" has the same connotation . Despite being a borough of Greater London , the City of London has many special privileges and rights , which have been laid down over about a thousand years worth of legislation . In particular it elects its own mayor , known as \" The Lord Mayor of London \" although this is now a ceremonial position rather than one with any specific power . The City has its own separate police force from the rest of Greater London , has many of its own laws , and ( somewhat controversially ) positions on the City of London council are voted for by the corporations that are based in the City , rather than the ( very few ) people who live there , as happens in every other UK election .",

    "answer": "In London, and in many cities around the world, there are different levels of government that have authority over different areas. \nThe city of London is a city within the larger country of England. Within the city of London, there are several smaller areas called boroughs. Camden is one of these boroughs. Each borough is responsible for taking care of the needs of the people who live there, such as providing schools, libraries, and trash collection. \nSo, to summarize, the city of London is a larger area that is made up of smaller areas called boroughs. Camden is one of these boroughs, and it is part of the city of London. This system helps to make it easier for different levels of government to take care of the needs of the people who live in different parts of the city.",

    "question": "If time moves slower the faster an object goes , why do n't clocks in cars or on airplanes ever get out of sync . Basically title . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Time dilation is a phenomenon that occurs when an object moves very fast relative to another object. According to the theory of relativity, time appears to move slower for objects that are moving very fast compared to objects that are not moving as fast. This means that if you were to travel in a fast-moving car or airplane, the clock on board would appear to run slower than a clock on the ground. \nHowever, the difference in time between the two clocks is very small, and it would be almost impossible to notice the difference unless you were able to travel at very high speeds for a very long period of time. For example, if you were to travel in a car at the speed of light for one year, the clock on the car would appear to run about 20 minutes slower than the clock on the ground. \nSo, even though time dilation does occur, the effects are usually too small to notice in everyday life. Clocks in cars and airplanes do not usually get out of sync because the difference in time is so small that it is not noticeable.",

    "answer": "An image of a spinning object can appear to change direction if the object is actually changing direction, or if the way the image is being captured or displayed is changing. \nIn the case of the tire in the video you linked, it appears that the tire is changing direction because it is actually changing direction. The tire is mounted on a vehicle that is driving in a circle, and as the vehicle turns, the tire changes direction. This is why the tire appears to stop and then start rotating in the opposite direction. \nIf the way the image is being captured or displayed is changing, it can also cause an object to appear to change direction. For example, if the camera filming the tire is moving or shaking, it can cause the tire to appear to change direction. Or, if the video is played in reverse, it can make the tire appear to change direction even if the tire itself is not actually changing direction. \nI hope this helps to explain why the tire in the video appears to change direction.

    "question": "How do chinese people Alphabetize ? EDIT : Oh shit , I need to get bored in class more often . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Just like everyone else ; the English alphabet does n't change if you 're Chinese ... On a more serious note , there are two ways : 1 . You group in radicals ( i.e. the radical \u5973 means \" woman \" and makes all characters that contain it have a feminine quality : - \u5988 = Mother - \u59d0 = older sister - \u597d = good Within radicals , you group by number of strokes needed to write that radical : - \u5973 takes 3 strokes to write - \u6728 takes 4 strokes to write Therefore , words that contain \u5973 as a radical come before those that contain \u6728 in a dictionary . For a complete list of radicals in the order they come in a dictionary : URL_3 2 . The other way to alphabetize is quite modern since it 's a western adaptation . Every character in mandarin Chinese can be pronounced using the western alphabet plus an accent , so in dictionaries that use this classification , they 'll convert \u5973 to \" n\u01da \" , \u5988 to \" m\u0101 \" , \u59d0 to \" ji\u011b \" . It would work just like an English dictionary , j coming before m , \u59d0 would come before \u5988 . Now to classify accents , they follow this simple order : - Flat accent ( horizontal line above the letter you want accented ) comes first : - ( e.g. \u0101 ) - Ascending accent comes second : / ( e.g. \u00e9 ) - Valley accent comes third : v ( e.g. \u011b ) - Descending accent comes fourth and last : \\ ( e.g. \u00e0 ) There are of course special cases like \u00a8 , but that 's more advanced , and not incredibly relevant to the main question . Third way , mentioned by someone else that I did n't know about ( probably the most ancient of all 3 methods ): URL_0 EDIT : WOW THANK YOU FOR GOLD ! EDIT2 : The proper word for \" accent \" is \" tone \" as some have pointed out . Also , for tones in Cantonese : URL_1 EDIT3 : changed \" neutral accent \" to \" flat \" EDIT4 : Some have asked why \u6728 takes 4 strokes , when you can technically do it in 3 . The ^ in \u6728 is n't a legitimate stroke ( based on millennia of customs ) . List of legitimate strokes : URL_2 EDIT5 : Added \" sort by stroke \" , 3rd method .",

    "question": "How do chinese people Alphabetize ? EDIT : Oh shit , I need to get bored in class more often . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "In China, the official writing system is Chinese characters, which are not based on an alphabet. Chinese characters represent the pronunciation of a word and its meaning, but they do not represent individual sounds like the letters of an alphabet do. \nInstead of using an alphabet, Chinese people use a system called pinyin to alphabetize words. Pinyin is a system that represents the sounds of Chinese characters using the letters of the Latin alphabet. For example, the Chinese character for \"apple\" is \u82f9\u679c (p\u00edng gu\u01d2) in pinyin. \nTo alphabetize words in Chinese using pinyin, you would simply arrange the words in order based on the pinyin spelling. For example, \"apple\" would come before \"banana\" because \"a\" comes before \"b\" in the alphabet. \nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

    "answer": "Capitalism by its nature leads to a concentration of power , benefiting the few elites at the top at the expense of everyone else , thus leading to grave social inequality .

    "answer": "When a person receives a blood transfusion, it is very important that the blood type of the donor and the recipient are compatible. If a person receives a blood transfusion with incompatible blood, it can cause serious problems and can even be life-threatening. \nThere are different blood types, and each person has one of these types: A, B, AB, or O. In addition to these blood types, there is also a factor called the Rh factor, which can be positive or negative. This means that there are eight possible blood types: A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, and O-. \nWhen a person receives a blood transfusion, their immune system may recognize the donated blood as foreign and attack it. This can cause a reaction called transfusion reaction, which can lead to serious complications such as anemia, kidney damage, and even death. \nTo avoid transfusion reactions, doctors and hospitals carefully match the blood type of the donor and recipient before a transfusion is given. They do this by testing the blood of both the donor and recipient to determine their blood type and Rh factor. This way, they can make sure that the donated blood is compatible with the recipient's blood, and that the transfusion will be safe. \nIn the past, it was common for doctors to try different blood types on patients to see which one worked best. However, this practice was very risky and led to many deaths. Today, doctors and hospitals use careful blood typing and testing to ensure that transfusions are as safe as possible.",

It helps the singer keep in tune by blocking out external noise and playing back the band audio through the earpiece so the singer can hear themselves in relation to the rest of the band . Without such monitors , it 's actually very difficult for singers to sing in tune because the sound of the band gets drowned out by everyone in the audience and most people ca n't sing with absolute pitch ( i.e. sing the correct frequency / pitch without a reference point ) . As an alternative to ( or in combination with ) in - ear monitors , there often speakers set up on stage that are pointed directly toward the singer / band members that perform a similar function . In - ear monitors are also sometimes used to secretly provide instructions or other messages to performers . Edit : It 's also worth noting that , in some cases , the audio played back through the in - ear monitor is a pre - recorded version of the song ( e.g. from an album ) . Each band member and/or dancer can then match their live performance to the track played in their ear .

    "answer": "Reservoir dams are usually curved towards the lake because it helps to increase their stability. When a dam is built, it is subjected to a variety of forces, including the weight of the water in the reservoir, the pressure of the water against the dam, and the forces of the earth and rocks on either side of the dam. \nIf a dam is straight, these forces can cause it to bend or even break. But if the dam is curved, the forces are distributed more evenly along the length of the dam, which makes it stronger and more stable. \nImagine holding a piece of paper straight up in front of you. If you push down on the top of the paper, it will bend easily. But if you curve the paper slightly, it will be much stronger and harder to bend. It's the same principle with reservoir dams - the curve helps to distribute the forces more evenly, which makes the dam stronger and more stable.",

    "answer": "It is true that humans are one of the few animals that regularly brush their teeth as part of their daily hygiene routine. Most animals do not need to brush their teeth because they have a diet that is different from ours and does not cause as much damage to their teeth. \nFor example, many animals, such as cats and dogs, eat a diet that is high in protein and low in sugar. This type of diet can help keep their teeth clean and healthy. In contrast, humans tend to eat more sugary and starchy foods, which can cause cavities and other problems with the teeth. \nTo keep our teeth healthy, it is important for humans to brush and floss regularly to remove plaque, a sticky film of bacteria that forms on the teeth and can lead to tooth decay. Brushing and flossing help to remove plaque and prevent tooth decay and gum disease. \nSo, while most animals do not need to brush their teeth like humans do, it is still important for us to take good care of our teeth to keep them healthy and strong.",

If someone walks into a church , any denomination or faith , and asks to see the minister , they 're in crisis : they will see the minister , who will sit down with them , hear what they 're having issues with , and either offer advice and counseling , put them in touch with social and other community services , or help them right then and there . I was traveling cross country and left my wallet at a restaurant a few hours behind me . It was a small town , and I stopped by the local Catholic Church . I told the Father straight up I 'm not a catholic , and he jokingly said \" Nobody 's perfect \" , put me up in a room of the church for the night , someone took me out to breakfast the next morning , the fueled up my car , handed me $ 40 cash incase I needed another fuel - up , and sent me on my way . I needed help , and they helped out . I drove back to the diner , got my wallet , bought an envelope and a stamp , stuffed $ 100 cash from an ATM into the envelope , and when driving back through town stopped at the local PO and dropped the letter in the mail . If it had not been for the kindness and generosity of a community I 'm politically at odds with , I would have been up - a - creek without a paddle . Could I have gotten assistance some other way ? Sure , but a church is a clearly - visible place to seek guidance , help , or if you 're into it , faith . It was a logical place to go . Do churches turn people away ? All the time , especially if they have reason to believe they 're pulling a fast one on them . As a Red Cross volunteer , we set up shelters at religious centers of all faiths , from Buddhist to Muslim , many times and every time they responded with generosity unbelievable for people who were not of their faith . We can disagree with the faith and politics of any particular faith or religious groups , but more often than not they 're out there doing some of the grimy dirty work helping the poor and affected by disaster , personal and regional . I 'm part of a UU church that takes turns with other churches of other faiths and denominations to house homeless women one night a week . We cook for them , we make sure they have toiletries and things for the night , and stand guard over them while they sleep , and feed them in the morning before sending them off . Some women were there by choice : druggies and the like , others through situations beyond their control . This is why faith groups have religious exemption , and why they always will .",

    "question": "Why are churches / other religious fronts exempt from tax ? I 'm pretty hazy on the tax thing in general , but this makes no sense to me . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "In the United States, churches and other religious organizations are generally exempt from paying federal income tax. This tax exemption is based on the principle of separation of church and state, which is reflected in the First Amendment to the Constitution. \nThe First Amendment protects the freedom of religion, and one way it does this is by preventing the government from interfering with the operations of religious organizations. This includes not requiring them to pay taxes on their income. \nHowever, it's important to note that religious organizations are still subject to other taxes, such as property taxes on any buildings or land they own. They are also required to follow all other laws and regulations, just like any other organization. \nIt's also worth noting that not all religious organizations are exempt from paying taxes. For example, churches and other religious organizations may lose their tax-exempt status if they engage in political activities or if they do not meet certain requirements, such as filing annual tax returns or disclosing certain financial information.",

    "answer": "Human beings actually have a pretty good sense of smell, especially compared to other primates. However, it is true that some animals, like dogs and bears, have a much stronger sense of smell than humans do. This is because their brains have a larger area dedicated to processing smells, called the olfactory bulb. \nThere are a few reasons why humans might not have evolved to have such a strong sense of smell. One reason is that our brains are larger and more complex than those of many other animals, and so we have had to trade off some abilities in order to develop others. For example, while we might not have as good a sense of smell as a dog, we have much better language skills and problem-solving abilities. \nAnother reason is that humans have developed other ways of finding food and avoiding danger that do not rely on our sense of smell. For example, we have developed tools and technologies that allow us to hunt and gather food, and we have learned to use our eyes and ears to detect danger. \nSo, while it might be helpful to have a stronger sense of smell in some situations, it is not necessarily the most important sense for human survival. Humans have evolved to be very adaptable and capable of thriving in a wide range of environments, and our senses have evolved to help us do so.",

    "answer": "The system of nobility and peasanthood, also known as feudalism, developed in medieval Europe around the 9th and 10th centuries. It was a way for lords and kings to organize their lands and the people who lived on them. \nUnder feudalism, lords granted land to nobles in exchange for their loyalty and military service. These nobles, also known as vassals, owed the lord a certain amount of service, such as fighting in wars or providing soldiers for the lord's army. In return, the lord protected the noble and their land. \nTo become a noble, a family had to be granted land by a lord or king. They could also inherit noble status from their parents. Nobles had certain powers and responsibilities, such as the right to collect taxes from the peasants who lived on their land and the responsibility to provide justice for those peasants. They were also expected to serve the lord and participate in wars if needed. \nIn summary, the system of nobility and peasanthood was a way for lords and kings to divide their lands and the people who lived on them. Nobles were granted land in exchange for their loyalty and military service, and they had certain powers and responsibilities as a result.",

    "question": "What is the relationship between resolution ( pixels ) and the dimensions of a printed photo ? In other words : \" How big of a poster could I make with a 12 megapixel photo without losing quality ? \" Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The measurement you are looking for is dots - per - inch , or DPI . Let 's use some easy numbers ... Imagine you had a picture that was 1,000 x 1,000 pixels . That picture would actually contain 1 million pixels , or what modern marketing called 1 megapixel . If you tried to print it 10 \" x 10 \" , you would have 100 dots per inch ( 1,000 dots / 10 inches = 100 dots per inch ) . On the other hand , if you tried printing a 5 \" x 5 \" print , you would have 200 dots per inch and the picture would look much clearer . Ideally , you want at least 300 dots per inch for quality prints . Since real images are rarely square , you have to choose one dimension to work with , usually the width . A 12 - megapixel image is usually 4368 ( wide ) by 2912 ( height ) pixels . So , if you want to print a 4x6 , you end up with 4368 / 6 = 728 DPI ( measured by width ) That is about double the quality that you actually need to print . To answer your question , you can work the other way , too , with some algrbra . If 300 DPI is acceptable to you : 4368 / x = 300 DPI 300x = 4368 x = 14.5 \" And since y = 2/3 x , y = 9.7 \" So , maintaining a minimum of 300 DPI , the biggest picture you could print is 14.5 \" x 9.7 \" You could print it larger with lower quality , and the smaller you print it , the better it would look . On the other hand , if your printer prints at 300 or 360 DPI maximum , having a picture with more detail will not help . That turned into a long answer ! Hope it helps ...",

    "question": "What is the relationship between resolution ( pixels ) and the dimensions of a printed photo ? In other words : \" How big of a poster could I make with a 12 megapixel photo without losing quality ? \" Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The resolution of a photo, measured in pixels, refers to the number of tiny dots that make up the image. The more pixels there are, the higher the resolution and the more detail the photo will have. The dimensions of a printed photo, on the other hand, refer to the size of the print in inches or centimeters. \nSo, to answer your question, the size of the poster you can make with a 12 megapixel photo without losing quality depends on the print resolution that you use. If you print the photo at a high resolution, you will be able to make a larger poster without losing quality. If you print the photo at a lower resolution, the poster will still be the same size, but the image may not be as sharp and clear as it could be. \nFor example, if you want to make a poster that is 24 inches by 36 inches and you want to print it at a high resolution, you will need a photo with a lot of pixels, such as a 12 megapixel photo. On the other hand, if you only want to make a small poster, say 8 inches by 10 inches, you could use a photo with a lower resolution, such as a 5 megapixel photo, and it would still look good. \nSo, in general, the bigger you want to print your photo, the more pixels you will need to maintain good quality.",

    "answer": "A Clockwork Orange is a novel written by Anthony Burgess and later adapted into a film directed by Stanley Kubrick. The story follows the life of a young man named Alex, who is a delinquent and enjoys committing acts of violence and crime. He is eventually arrested and undergoes an experimental form of rehabilitation that aims to cure him of his violent tendencies. \nThe fuss around A Clockwork Orange is due to the controversial themes and ideas that it explores. One of the main themes of the novel and film is the nature of free will and the consequences of trying to control or manipulate it. The story raises questions about whether it is ethical to try to change someone's behavior through means such as brainwashing, and whether it is possible to truly reform someone who has engaged in violent or criminal behavior. \nAnother theme of the story is the idea that true freedom involves the ability to choose between good and evil, and that taking away this choice removes an essential aspect of what makes us human. The novel and film also explore the theme of the dangers of a society that becomes too focused on order and control, and the potential for this to lead to a loss of personal freedom and individuality. \nOverall, the message of A Clockwork Orange might be seen as a cautionary tale about the dangers of trying to control or manipulate people's behavior, and the importance of preserving individual freedom and choice.",

    "question": "Why is n't it considered corruption when politicians grant access to lobbyists in return for financial gain . EDIT : Since lobbyists give campaign donations and receive access to politicians in return , why is n't this considered corruption ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Hi- I 've been a registered lobbyist in the US so I can give you a perspective different than most of the others here . First , when a lobbyist gives money , they 're probably not giving their own money . Instead , they they are giving money from a Political Action Committee which collects money from other donors . Corporations can also have corporate PACs . This is important because lobbyists are speaking on behalf of others . In the US there is a constitutional right to petition government . Donating to political campaigns is also recognized an as expression of free speech . The US also has a strong tradition of legal representation -- Americans generally want a lawyer to advise them on issues in the courtroom whereas in some other , often authoritarian countries , you do n't have that luxury and are forced to navigate a complex legal system you do nt understand by yourself . So when a lobbyist donates money to a politicians campaign , they are ( 1 ) assisting donors to exercise their freedom of speech and ( 2 ) assisting donors to petition their government . Lobbyists are specialists , just like plumbers or lawyers . They understand the byzantine way that a government works and they can provide expert advice about what is realistic , what is ethical and how to accomplish a goal . So , now the question is , does money equal access . The answer , based on a long history of studies is -- yes . Money does get you access . But you can also get access when you do n't give money . And you can be ignored even if you do give money . Getting in the door is really hard and really important . I ca n't tell you how many hours I 've spent just trying to figure out how to get into a room . That said , getting into a room does n't get you anything more than face time . I 've sat across a coffee table from members of congress who loathed the group I represented . Being in their presence did n't get me anything ( other than making conservative members of my group happy that i reached out ) . I do not agree that corruption is getting in the room . It does n't actually get you anything . Getting something is ... well ... getting something . And yes , you do see that some companies are able to getting everything that they want from certain members of congress , but the reality is that * * they were bought and sold before they even ran for office . * * Another thing -- if you talk to lobbyists , a large percentage , i 'd say half , will say that money really does ruin politics . I personally believe in 100 % public financed campaigns and a prohibition on any contribution or in kind contribution . It will never happen , and the reason is not because politicians wo n't let it happen . The reason is that the public wo n't let it happen . Politicians are n't any different than anyone else . They 're just a reflection that people do n't like to see .",

    "answer": "Lobbying is a legitimate way for businesses, organizations, and individuals to try to influence decisions made by government officials, such as lawmakers. Lobbyists may give campaign donations to politicians in order to gain access to them and present their viewpoints on issues that are important to them. While this type of activity may be seen as potentially influencing a politician's decision-making, it is not necessarily considered corruption. \nCorruption is generally defined as the abuse of power or position for personal gain. In the context of lobbying, if a politician were to grant special favors or take specific actions in exchange for campaign donations or other forms of personal gain, that would be considered corruption. However, simply receiving campaign donations and allowing lobbyists to present their viewpoints does not necessarily constitute corruption. It is important for politicians to be transparent about their interactions with lobbyists and to disclose any campaign donations they receive in order to ensure that the process is fair and aboveboard.",

    "question": "Why do drugs make our eyes look different ? why do we experience dilated pupils , red eyes , glossy eyes , low eyes ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "It depends on what the drug is . Cannabis , for example , causes blood vessels in your eyes to expand slightly , which makes them more visible . Some people also get it from mild allergies to something in the plant . Drugs that cause increases of seratonin levels ( cocaine , LSD , MDMA ) cause dilation . Seratonin stimulates the 5 - HT2A receptor . It has an inhibitory effect on areas in your visual cortex . I suspect its inhibiting the ability of the sphincter muscles that constrict your iris to work . More simply , drugs like LSD cause a bunch of a chemical to pool in your brain that shuts of the iris constriction muscles . Some drugs increase norepinephrine levels , including cocaine and meth . This stimulates the sympathetic nervous system , causing the \" fight or flight \" response . One of these responses is the dilation of the pupils . This uses the iris dilator muscle , which does the opposite of the sphincter muscle and pushes the iris open . Opiates cause pupil constriction . I ca n't find the exact mechanism , but I believe it stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system , which is sorta like the opposite of the \" fight or flight \" response . I also just found that dextromethorphan ( DXM ) acts on the parasympathetic nervous system , so I would also expect it to cause constriction , though I do n't know for sure . Glassy eyes are caused by drugs that depress the central nervous system . One reason this happens is that you blink less if your nervous system gets turned down . This appearance is exacerbated by pupil dilation . ELI5 summary : Red eyes are caused by blood vessel expansion . Dilation is caused either by the brain shutting down the constriction muscles or by turning on the dilation muscles , depending . Constriction is caused by the brain activating the constriction muscles . Glassy eyes are caused by eyes drying out and pupil dilation .",

    "answer": "Sure! When you take drugs, they can affect the way your body works and feels. Different drugs can have different effects on your body, including your eyes. \nDilated pupils: Pupils are the small, black circles in the center of your eyes that control how much light enters your eyes. When you take certain drugs, your pupils may get bigger, or dilated. This is because the drug is affecting the muscles around your pupils, causing them to relax and open wider. \nRed eyes: Some drugs can make your eyes red because they can cause blood vessels in your eyes to become larger and more visible. This can also happen if you smoke certain drugs, like marijuana. \nGlossy eyes: Glossy eyes can happen when a person takes drugs that cause their eyes to feel dry or produce less tears. Without enough tears, the surface of the eye may look glossy or shiny. \nLow eyes: Low, or droopy, eyes can happen when a person takes drugs that relax the muscles around their eyes. This can cause the eyelids to feel heavy and droop down. \nIt's important to remember that drugs can have many different effects on the body and can be dangerous to use. If you have any concerns about drugs and their effects, it's a good idea to talk to a trusted adult or a healthcare professional.",

Everything with mass is constantly pulling on everything else with Mass no matter how far they are . If they are n't moving fast enough to counteract the force pulling them together then they eventually collide and form a larger object with a greater pull . This continues to happen until you get planets . In some cases the planets get so massive that their gravitational pull is stronger than the forces keeping atoms far apart and then the sun will collapse into a black hole . Second question : > There are three main sources of heat in the deep earth : ( 1 ) heat from when the planet formed and accreted , which has not yet been lost ; ( 2 ) frictional heating , caused by denser core material sinking to the center of the planet ; and ( 3 ) heat from the decay of radioactive elements .",

How did a gravitational pull in a single location built mass that became a planet ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Sure! So, planets form from the leftover material that was left over after the sun formed. This material was made up of gas, dust, and small rocks. When the sun formed, it was so hot that it blew most of the gas away, but some of the dust and small rocks stuck together because of their own gravitational pull. \nAs more and more of these small pieces stuck together, they formed bigger and bigger clumps. Eventually, these clumps became big enough to be called planets. The bigger the planet, the stronger its gravitational pull, which is why it can hold onto more material and grow even bigger. \nThe core of a planet is hot because it is made up of very heavy elements, such as iron and nickel, which are denser and heavier than the other materials that make up the planet. When the planet was forming, these heavy elements sank to the center of the planet and formed the core. The heat in the core comes from the pressure of all of the material above it, as well as the heat that was generated when the planet was forming. \nI hope that helps!

    "answer": "Prescribed burns are a way of intentionally setting fire to a specific area in a controlled and planned manner. They are often used as a tool for managing forests and grasslands. \nThere are several reasons why prescribed burns can be good for the environment: \n1. Prescribed burns can reduce the risk of uncontrolled wildfires. Wildfires can be extremely destructive and dangerous, and they can be difficult to control once they start. By conducting prescribed burns, land managers can reduce the amount of dry, dead vegetation that can fuel a wildfire, which can help to prevent future fires from spreading out of control. \n2. Prescribed burns can improve habitat for wildlife. Many plants and animals depend on fire to maintain their habitats. For example, some plants have seeds that only germinate after a fire, and some animals rely on the open, grassy areas created by burns for foraging and nesting. \n3. Prescribed burns can improve the health of forests and grasslands. Over time, dead plants and debris can build up on the forest floor, which can make it difficult for new plants to grow. Prescribed burns can help to clear out this debris, which can allow new plants to take root and thrive. \n4. Prescribed burns can also help to improve air quality. When vegetation is burned, it releases smoke and other particles into the air. While this can be a concern for air quality in the short term, prescribed burns are typically conducted in a way that minimizes the amount of smoke produced, and they can help to reduce the amount of pollutants that build up in the air over time. \nI hope this helps to explain the benefits of prescribed burns. It's important to remember that they are a tool that is used by land managers to help manage and protect natural areas, and they can have many positive impacts on the environment.",

    "answer": "In the United States, it is common for stores to require customers to show identification (ID) when purchasing certain over-the-counter (OTC) medications, such as Nyquil and acetaminophen, if they appear to be under a certain age. This is because some OTC medications contain ingredients that can be harmful if taken in large amounts or if taken by certain age groups. For example, Nyquil contains a sedating ingredient called diphenhydramine that can cause drowsiness and should not be taken by people under the age of 12. Acetaminophen is generally safe to take, but taking too much can cause liver damage, so it is important to follow the dosing instructions on the label. \nIf you are under the age of 18 and in need of medication, you should talk to your parent or guardian about getting the appropriate treatment. If you are unable to do so, you can consider seeking medical attention from a healthcare professional, such as a pharmacist or a doctor. They may be able to provide you with the medication you need or suggest alternative treatment options. \nIn summary, it is important to follow the age recommendations for OTC medications to ensure your safety and to avoid potential harm. If you are under the age of 18 and need medication, you should talk to a trusted adult or healthcare professional for help.",

    "answer": "There are slight discrepancies in gene expression with regard to how hair color is expressed on body hair vs. head hair , and it 's possible to have body hair of a slightly different color . With blonde hair , you lack pigmentation altogether , while if a gene that 's only expressed in the follicles on the body does code for pigment , then you can end up brownish hair on the body while being a natural blond . It 's not like there 's one gene for color and that tells the whole story - there are multiple genes expressed in different ways that give us more of the myriad of hair colors than just simply identical brown , black , blond and red .",

    "question": "(NSFW)Why is it common for blonde haired people to have Dark pubic hair instead of blonde ? Redheads have red pubes Why do n't blondes have blond pubes ? EDIT : Damn that blew up Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The color of a person's hair is determined by a pigment called melanin, which is produced by cells called melanocytes. The amount of melanin in a person's hair, skin, and eyes is determined by their genetics. \nThe color of a person's pubic hair is also determined by melanin, but it is not necessarily the same color as the hair on their head. This is because the hair follicles that produce pubic hair are different from the ones that produce the hair on a person's head. The amount of melanin in the hair follicles that produce pubic hair may be different from the amount of melanin in the hair follicles that produce head hair. \nIn general, people with blond hair have less melanin in their hair than people with darker hair. This is why blond hair is often lighter in color than darker hair. However, the amount of melanin in a person's pubic hair may be different from the amount of melanin in their head hair, which is why some people with blond hair may have darker pubic hair. \nIt is also worth noting that the color of a person's pubic hair can change over time due to factors such as aging and hormonal changes. So, it is possible for a person's pubic hair to be a different color than their head hair at different points in their life.",

    "answer": "In a criminal trial, the defendant is considered innocent until proven guilty. The prosecution, or the side that is trying to prove that the defendant is guilty, is responsible for presenting evidence and witness testimony to show that the defendant committed the crime. The defense, or the side representing the defendant, is responsible for challenging the prosecution's evidence and presenting their own evidence and arguments to try to show that the defendant is not guilty. \nAs part of this process, the defense lawyer is not responsible for asking the defendant whether they committed the crime. Instead, the lawyer's job is to present a defense for the defendant, which may include questioning the prosecution's evidence and witnesses, presenting evidence and witness testimony on behalf of the defendant, and making legal arguments to try to show that the defendant is not guilty. \nThis process is in place to ensure that the defendant receives a fair trial. It allows the defendant to have an advocate who can present a defense on their behalf, and it also helps to protect against wrongful convictions by requiring the prosecution to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt.",

    "question": "How Can Headphones or Speakers Pick Up Radio Waves ? as seen here : URL_0 Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Sure! Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation, just like light or heat. Electromagnetic radiation is a type of energy that travels through the air (and through space) as a wave. \nRadio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation that travels through the air at the speed of light. They have a longer wavelength than other types of electromagnetic radiation, such as visible light or X-rays. Radio waves are used to transmit information, such as music or news, through the air from one place to another. \nHeadphones and speakers are able to pick up radio waves because they have a small device inside called a radio receiver. The radio receiver is made up of tiny electronic components that are able to detect radio waves and convert them into an electrical signal. When the electrical signal is sent to the speakers, they use it to produce sound waves that we can hear. \nSo, to sum it up: radio waves are a type of energy that travels through the air and can be picked up by a radio receiver inside headphones or speakers, which converts the radio waves into an electrical signal that the speakers use to produce sound waves that we can hear.

    "answer": "When you click the back button in your web browser, it takes you back to the previous page you were on. However, if you were watching a YouTube video and clicked a link to go to a new page while the video was still playing, then clicking the back button will take you back to the YouTube video rather than the page you were on before. This is because the video is still playing in the background and the page you were on before is no longer being displayed. \nClicking the back button twice will take you back to the page you were on before the video. \nAs for the view count on the video, each time the video is loaded and played, it counts as a view. So if you click back and watch the video again, it will count as an additional view. However, if you simply click back and don't watch the video again, the view count will not increase.",

This can lead to high or low blood sugar levels, which can cause serious health problems. \nOne of the places that diabetes can cause problems is in your feet. When you have diabetes, it can be harder for your body to fight off infections, and it can be harder for cuts and sores on your feet to heal. This means that if you have a cut or sore on your foot, it could become infected and get worse quickly. \nThat's why it's important for people with diabetes to be extra careful with their feet. They should check their feet every day for cuts, sores, or other problems, and they should wear shoes that fit well and protect their feet. If they notice a problem with their feet, they should tell their doctor right away so they can get treatment. \nBy taking good care of their feet, people with diabetes can help prevent serious problems and keep their feet healthy.",

    "answer": "Scientists think that there could be more than three dimensions because there are some theories in physics that suggest the existence of extra dimensions. For example, one theory called string theory suggests that there could be as many as 10 dimensions. \nAs for time being considered the fourth dimension, it's a bit more complicated. In our everyday experience, we move through three dimensions of space (left/right, up/down, and forward/backward) and we experience the passage of time. However, in the language of physics, time is often treated as a dimension just like the three dimensions of space. \nThink of it like this: Imagine you are an ant crawling on a sheet of paper. You can only move left/right and up/down on the sheet, so you are only aware of two dimensions. But if you could somehow \"travel\" through the paper, you would be moving in a third dimension (into and out of the paper). Time is a little bit like that third dimension - we can move \"forward\" in time, but we can't move \"backward\" in time like we can move up/down or left/right in space. Does that make sense?",

    "answer": "HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is present in every region of the world, including Asia. However, the prevalence of HIV and AIDS can vary significantly from one region to another due to a variety of factors. \nOne reason that HIV and AIDS may be more prevalent in certain regions, such as Africa, is because of limited access to healthcare and HIV prevention services. In Africa, for example, many people may not have access to HIV testing, antiretroviral therapy, or other forms of treatment that can help prevent the transmission of HIV. This can lead to higher rates of HIV and AIDS in certain populations. \nIn addition to access to healthcare, the prevalence of HIV and AIDS can also be influenced by social and cultural factors, such as stigma and discrimination surrounding HIV and AIDS. In some regions, people who are living with HIV or AIDS may face discrimination or social exclusion, which can make it more difficult for them to access the care and support they need. \nIt's important to note that HIV and AIDS can affect anyone, regardless of their income or social status. While HIV and AIDS may be more prevalent in certain regions or among certain populations, it's important for everyone to take steps to protect themselves and their communities from HIV and AIDS. This includes practicing safe sex, getting tested regularly for HIV, and seeking treatment if necessary.",

    "question": "What gives atoms their various properties ? Glancing at the period table I can discern no pattern . Can you predict what behaviour an atom will have because of the balance of subatomic particles in the system ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Yes , broadly speaking . Atoms gain their properties due to their valence . Learning about this is basically most of the first semester of a college chemistry course , but the short version is : Atoms are basically clouds of electrons surrounding a core of protons and neutrons . The clouds of electrons behave in a way that is random , but overall very predictable , and they try to form a pattern that resembles a shell of electrons composed of sets of four pairs to make an octet . Bigger atoms have many shells of eight , smaller ones may have only one ( or fewer than one complete shell ) but it 's only the outermost shell that really matters for bonding and chemical properties . When two elements bond , they share an electron or two to fulfil their octets . Different atoms as you go down a row of the periodic table have different numbers of valience electrons in their outermost shell . These are what make atoms react differently . Lithium , sodium , potassium , etc , have one atom in their outermost valience shell - that means they want to bond very much with something that can fill their shell . If you put sodium in water , it rips the water apart , and causes an explosion as the oxygen and hydrogen heat up . Likewise , flourine , chlorine , iodine , etc , all have seven electrons in their outer shell - they want badly to fill with things with only one electron , like hydrogen . That 's why these elements can make such powerful acids - it 's very easy for them to steal a hydrogen from water . Carbon has four electons . It ( and silicon , to a lesser degree ) is the whore of the elemnts . It loves to bond with a lot of stuff becuase there 's so many ways it can make pairs . Oxygen has six , so it loves to double bond ( share two pairs of electrons ) with carbon , or one each with hydrogen ( to make water . ) Finally the nobel gasses come complete with eight already . That 's why they hardly ever bond with * anything * . There 's more to this explanation than just that - radioactivity , transition elements , metals , different levels of valence shells , different types of bonds , subatomic forces , resonance , etc , but that is basically an entire chem course worth of information . But valence electrons are the most important thing overall .",

    "question": "What gives atoms their various properties ? Glancing at the period table I can discern no pattern . Can you predict what behaviour an atom will have because of the balance of subatomic particles in the system ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Atoms are made up of three types of subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. The number of protons in an atom's nucleus determines what element the atom is. For example, all atoms with 6 protons are carbon atoms, all atoms with 8 protons are oxygen atoms, and so on. \nThe properties of an atom are determined by the arrangement of its electrons. The electrons are arranged in shells around the nucleus, and each shell can hold a certain number of electrons. The outermost shell is called the valence shell, and the number of electrons in the valence shell determines how the atom will behave. \nIf an atom has a full valence shell, it is stable and not very reactive. Atoms that have only a few electrons in their valence shell, on the other hand, are more reactive because they want to gain more electrons to fill their valence shell. This is why some elements, like sodium and chlorine, are very reactive: they have only one or a few electrons in their valence shells and are eager to gain or lose those electrons to become more stable. \nSo to sum up: the number of protons in an atom's nucleus determines what element it is, and the arrangement of electrons around the nucleus determines the atom's properties.",

    "answer": "Programming bugs, also known as software bugs, are mistakes that are made by programmers while writing code. These mistakes can cause the program to behave unexpectedly or not work at all. \nThere are many ways that bugs can be introduced into a program. For example, a programmer might forget to include an important line of code, or might use the wrong type of data in a calculation. Sometimes, bugs are caused by mistakes in logic, where the programmer has written code that doesn't do what they intended it to do. \nIt can be difficult to create something without bugs because programming is a complex task that involves many steps and requires attention to detail. It is easy to make mistakes when writing code, especially if the programmer is working on a large and complex program. In addition, it is often difficult to test all possible scenarios and combinations of inputs to a program, so it is possible for bugs to remain hidden until the program is being used in the real world. \nTo reduce the number of bugs in a program, programmers often use techniques such as testing, debugging, and code reviews to identify and fix problems before the program is released. However, it is still possible for bugs to slip through and be discovered after the program is in use.",

    "answer": "The constellations do change, but it's hard for us to notice because the changes happen very slowly over a long period of time. \nThink about it this way: imagine you are standing on a very tall ladder, looking at the stars. You see a group of stars that form a shape, like a bear or a hunter. Now imagine that the ladder is slowly turning around. The stars are still there, but they seem to move in the sky as you change your perspective. \nThe same thing happens with the constellations. The Earth is moving around the sun, and the sun is moving around the galaxy, so the stars seem to move in the sky. But because the Earth takes a whole year to go around the sun, and the sun takes even longer to go around the galaxy, it takes a long time for the constellations to change. So, even though the constellations are always moving, it's hard for us to notice the changes because they happen so slowly.",

    "answer": "Most of the time it 's to do with behavioral modification . A vasectomy does n't remove any of the male hormones or change behavior at all . Intact male dogs will go wandering looking for females in heat , and also tend to be a little more argumentative . It also can be hard to keep weight on intact males . Dogs \" tie \" during sex , and can be severely injured if one partner breaks the tie . And of course all animals get STDs . Testicular cancer is also extremely common in intact males . Toms are much more likely to get in fights , and they will spray everything in your house . Stallions can be aggressive , very mouthy , and difficult to handle . They also tend not to grow as tall as geldings . Also difficult to keep weight on them , and need to be housed completely separately from mares .

    "question": "Why are n't animals given a vasectomy instead of being neutered ? It seems like it would be much more humane Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "There are a few reasons why veterinarians usually prefer to neuter animals (i.e., remove their testicles) rather than performing a vasectomy (i.e., cutting the vas deferens to block the flow of sperm). \nFirst, a vasectomy is a more complicated and invasive surgery than neutering. It requires a higher level of surgical skill and specialized equipment, and the recovery period is typically longer for the animal. In contrast, neutering is a relatively straightforward procedure that can often be performed under general anesthesia in a veterinary clinic setting. \nSecond, neutering is more effective at reducing unwanted behaviors in animals, such as aggression, marking territory, and roaming. This is because neutering removes the source of hormones (testosterone) that contribute to these behaviors. A vasectomy, on the other hand, only blocks the flow of sperm and does not significantly reduce the production of hormones. \nFinally, neutering is a more cost-effective option for pet owners, as it is generally less expensive than a vasectomy. \nOverall, while a vasectomy might seem more humane in theory, in practice it is usually a less practical and effective option for preventing unwanted pregnancies and modifying behavior in animals.",

    "answer": "Great question! The Earth is not a perfect sphere, it is actually slightly flattened at the poles and bulges at the equator. This means that the Earth's rotational axis, which is an imaginary line that runs through the center of the Earth and around which the Earth rotates, is not perpendicular to the surface of the Earth. Instead, it is tilted by about 23.5 degrees. \nThe North Pole is the point on the Earth's surface that is directly above the Earth's rotational axis. This is the point that is used to define the direction of \"north.\" \nTrue North, on the other hand, is the direction of the North Pole relative to the surface of the Earth. It is the direction that a compass needle points towards, which is not the same as the direction of the North Pole. This is because the Earth's magnetic field causes the compass needle to be attracted to the Earth's magnetic north pole, which is not exactly the same as the Earth's rotational north pole. \nSo, to sum it up: \"North\" is the direction that is defined by the Earth's rotational axis, and \"True North\" is the direction that a compass needle points towards due to the Earth's magnetic field. Both of these directions are important for different reasons, and that's why we have both of them.",

    "answer": "Global warming and climate change are often used interchangeably, but they refer to slightly different things. \nGlobal warming refers to the increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere, especially at the surface, which has been occurring over the past century or so. The main cause of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, which releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun and cause the Earth's temperature to rise. \nClimate change, on the other hand, refers to the broader range of changes that are occurring in the Earth's climate, including not only the increase in temperature, but also changes in precipitation patterns, sea level, and other factors. Climate change can be caused by both natural and human factors, and it can have a range of impacts on the environment, including more frequent heatwaves, droughts, and extreme weather events like hurricanes and floods. \nSo, to sum it up, global warming is a specific aspect of climate change, which is a broader term that encompasses a range of changes that are occurring in the Earth's climate.",

    "answer": "Cars only have defroster grids in the rear window because the front windshield is made of different material than the rear window. The front windshield is made of laminated safety glass, which is two layers of glass with a plastic layer in between. The laminated safety glass is designed to stay in one piece even if it cracks or breaks, so it doesn't need a defroster grid to help clear it. \nThe rear window, on the other hand, is usually made of tempered glass, which is a type of glass that shatters into small pieces if it breaks. Tempered glass is used in the rear window because it is stronger and more durable than regular glass, but it is also more prone to fogging up or getting covered in condensation. That's why the rear window has a defroster grid, which is a grid of heating elements that help clear the window of fog or condensation. \nSo, in short, cars have defroster grids in the rear window because it is made of a different type of glass that is more prone to fogging up, and because the front windshield is made of laminated safety glass that doesn't need a defroster grid.",

    "question": "When I need to pee , and I 'm standing there waiting , but nothing is coming out , what 's happening in my body that 's making me wait ? Shy pissers unite ! Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "You brain is good at knowing when the appropriate time to \" go \" is , so much so that it lets you be largely in charge of it . This happens because of 4 different types of nerves controlling the urinary mechanisms : Sensory ( afferent ) nerves , which tell you your bladder is full ; sympathetic ( \" fight / flight \" ) nerves which relax the bladder and keep the urinary sphincter tight ; parasympathetic ( \" rest / digest \" ) nerves which contract the bladder and relax said sphincter ; and somatic nerves ( that act on skeletal muscles , i.e. Muscles you can control voluntarily ) which let you initiate when to go . When you are in line at Fatty 's Pizza Shack , for instance , your sympathetic nervous system ( fight / flight ) is keeping that bladder sphincter tightly closed ( it does this without you even knowing it , much like you do n't need to consciously make your heart beat ) . Later , after drinking your extra large Floaty Shake , your bladder fills with urine , and sensory nerves alert you to this fact via stretch receptors on the bladder itself . As your bladder fills with more urine , the stretch sensors cause little contractions in the bladder which you feel as urges . When you finally feel like it 's a good time to pee on something , your somatic nerves signal your accessory muscles ( abdominals ) to assist with voiding ( a fancy word for micturition which is an even fancier word for urination ) , and your parasympathetic nerves ( rest / digest ) takes the hint and squeezes the bladder and relaxes your urinary sphincter . The result is pee happening . Several regions in the brain are also involved , mainly keeping you from peeing when you do n't want to pee . You can consciously keep from wetting yourself for quite a while , unless you have some sort of disease where nerves are damaged or the muscles in your bladder ( detrusor muscle and sphincters ) do n't cooperate . Incontinence = ca n't hold it in . Enuresis = bedwetting .",

    "answer": "When you feel the urge to urinate, your body is sending a signal to your brain that your bladder is full and needs to be emptied. The bladder is a muscular sac in your pelvis that stores urine until it is ready to be expelled from the body. \nWhen you stand at the toilet and try to urinate, your brain sends a signal to the muscles in your pelvic area to relax, including the muscles that control the bladder. At the same time, the muscles in the wall of your bladder contract, pushing the urine out through the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body). \nSometimes, when you try to urinate, the muscles in your pelvic area may not fully relax, or the muscles in the wall of your bladder may not contract strongly enough. This can make it difficult to start urinating, or to urinate as much as you normally would. This is more common in men, but it can happen to anyone. \nThere are a few things you can try to help you urinate more easily when you're having difficulty: \n1. Take a deep breath and try to relax your muscles. \n2. Try massaging your lower abdomen or stomach area gently. \n3. Drink a glass of water or another fluid. This can help to increase the volume of urine in your bladder, making it easier to start urinating. \n4. Try going back to bed and waiting a little while longer. Sometimes, just waiting a few minutes can help your muscles relax enough to allow you to urinate. \nIf you continue to have difficulty urinating, or if you have other symptoms such as pain or blood in your urine, you should speak with a healthcare provider. They can help to determine the cause of your symptoms and provide treatment if necessary.",

    "answer": "It's generally better for your teeth to have sugar in small amounts rather than all at once. That's because sugar can cause tooth decay, which is a process that happens when bacteria in your mouth use sugar from the foods you eat to make acids. These acids can attack your tooth enamel, which is the hard outer layer of your teeth. If the enamel gets weak or wears away, it can lead to cavities. \nWhen you eat or drink something with sugar in it, the bacteria in your mouth start making acid right away. The more sugar you eat or drink, the more acid they can make. So if you eat or drink a lot of sugar all at once, your teeth will be exposed to a lot of acid at once, which can be harmful. \nOn the other hand, if you have small amounts of sugar throughout the day, your teeth will be exposed to acid for a longer period of time, but the amount of acid they're exposed to at any given moment will be smaller. This can be less harmful to your teeth. \nIt's also important to remember to brush your teeth twice a day and floss once a day to help remove sugar and plaque from your teeth. Plaque is a sticky film of bacteria that can build up on your teeth and cause tooth decay. \nSo, to sum up: it's better for your teeth to have sugar in small amounts rather than all at once, and it's important to brush and floss your teeth to help protect them from sugar and plaque.",

    "answer": "There are several reasons why prescription drugs may be more expensive in the United States compared to other countries. \nOne reason is that the prices of prescription drugs are often higher in the United States because the manufacturers of those drugs can charge more. These higher prices may be due to the high cost of researching and developing new drugs, as well as the cost of marketing and selling them. \nAnother reason is that the government in the United States does not regulate the prices of prescription drugs as closely as it does in other countries. In other countries, the government may negotiate with drug manufacturers to get lower prices for prescription drugs, or it may regulate the prices of drugs to make them more affordable for people. In the United States, the government does not have this power, so drug manufacturers can set the prices of their drugs at whatever level they choose. \nFinally, the United States has a complex system for paying for prescription drugs, which can also contribute to higher prices. Insurance companies, pharmacies, and drug manufacturers all play a role in determining the final cost of a prescription drug, and this can make the pricing process more complicated and expensive. \nSo, to sum it up, prescription drugs may be more expensive in the United States because the manufacturers can charge more, the government does not regulate drug prices as closely, and the system for paying for drugs is complex.",

    "answer": "The 1.2W = 10W on an LED lightbulb means that the LED bulb uses 1.2 watts of electricity, but it produces the same amount of light as a traditional incandescent bulb that uses 10 watts of electricity. In other words, the LED bulb is a more energy-efficient way to produce light because it uses less electricity to produce the same amount of light. \nTo understand this better, let's compare how a traditional incandescent bulb and an LED bulb work. An incandescent bulb works by heating a thin wire called a filament until it becomes so hot that it glows and produces light. Because the filament gets so hot, it uses a lot of electricity to produce light. An LED bulb, on the other hand, works by using a semiconductor to convert electricity into light. Because the LED doesn't have to heat anything up to produce light, it uses much less electricity than an incandescent bulb. \nSo when you see 1.2W = 10W on an LED lightbulb, it means that the LED bulb uses 1.2 watts of electricity to produce the same amount of light as a traditional incandescent bulb that uses 10 watts of electricity. This means that the LED bulb is a more energy-efficient way to produce light because it uses less electricity to do the same job.",

    "answer": "Yes, it is true that going to the hospital in the United States can be very expensive, especially if you need major medical treatment such as surgery. There are several reasons for this. \nOne reason is that the cost of medical care in the United States is generally higher than in other countries. This is due to a variety of factors, including the high cost of new medical technologies and the high salaries of medical professionals. \nAnother reason is that the way the healthcare system works in the United States is different from how it works in other countries. In the United States, most people get their health insurance through their employer or by buying it on their own. The cost of this insurance can be very expensive, especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition or if you are older. \nIf you do not have health insurance, or if your insurance does not cover the full cost of your medical treatment, you may have to pay a lot of money out of your own pocket to cover the costs. This can be very difficult for some people, especially if they are already struggling to pay their bills. \nThe government does provide some assistance with healthcare costs through programs such as Medicaid and Medicare, which provide healthcare coverage to low-income individuals and seniors, respectively. However, these programs do not cover everyone, and the benefits may not be enough to cover all of the costs of medical treatment.",

    "question": "How is a place like Chernobyl uninhabitable due to radiation but Hiroshima is fine . What was the difference between the radiation in the two instances ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "There are a few of things that make Chernobyl still far more radioactive than Hiroshima and Nagasaki . First , the bombs actually did n't use very much radioactive material , all things considered . A nuclear reactor consumes much greater quantities of fuel than does a bomb , since the bomb is made to go BOOM and then be done with while the reactor needs a long , energetic , sustained reaction . Second , the fissile material in the atomic bombs was vaporized . I do n't mean that it disappeared , completely , but I mean was turned into plasma in the explosion . This pushed it much higher in the atmosphere and spread out the material over a huge distance . Without large concentrations , what little radioactive decay takes place over time ( remember that U235 and P239 have fairly long half lives and do n't release a ton of highly energetic particles when they do decay ) quickly became nominal compared to the standard background radiation . Third , very little of the fuel actually turned into the more dangerous radioactive intermediates . The percentages of the fuel actually consumed in those bombs is minute - more modern nuclear weaponry may leave longer lasting radiation . So that 's what happened in the bomb areas - Big releases of radiation at the time of explosion , but not much retained in the soil and region afterwards . In Chernobyl , on the other hand , large quantities of highly radioactive material were released into the atmosphere because of the heat from the fire generated . This includes radioactive steams ( heavy water ) , irradiated metals , intermediates , large quantities of spent and active fuels , the works . These were concentrated on the town , and were n't largely consumed in a big nuclear boom - most of those materials do n't actually go boom either . As a result of the varying half lives and the extremely large quantities of material in the area , it 's still very radioactive , especially near the core which got a logarithmically greater dose than the surrounding areas .",

    "question": "How is a place like Chernobyl uninhabitable due to radiation but Hiroshima is fine . What was the difference between the radiation in the two instances ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Chernobyl and Hiroshima are two very different places that were affected by radiation in very different ways. \nChernobyl was the site of a nuclear power plant disaster in 1986. A reactor at the plant exploded, releasing a huge amount of radiation into the environment. This radiation made the area around the plant unsafe for people to live in for a long time. \nHiroshima, on the other hand, was the site of an atomic bomb explosion during World War II. While the bomb did release a lot of radiation, it was only released for a very short period of time. The radiation levels in Hiroshima returned to normal relatively quickly, so people were able to go back and live there again. \nThe main difference between the two is the amount and duration of radiation released. In Chernobyl, the radiation was released over a longer period of time and covered a larger area, making it unsafe for people to live there. In Hiroshima, the radiation was released for a very short period of time and only affected a small area, so it was safe for people to return and live there again.",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why police departments might be reluctant to use body cameras. One reason is the cost of purchasing and maintaining the cameras and the associated technology. Body cameras and the infrastructure needed to support them can be expensive, and some police departments may not have the budget to implement a body camera program. \nAnother reason is the potential for privacy concerns. Body cameras record video and audio of everything that happens while they are turned on, and this can include personal conversations and interactions that might be considered private. There are also concerns about how the footage will be stored and who will have access to it. \nFinally, there may be logistical challenges to using body cameras, such as deciding when they should be turned on and off and how to handle footage that is recorded during sensitive or confidential situations. \nOverall, while body cameras can provide protection for police officers by providing a record of their interactions with the public, there are also potential costs and challenges associated with their use.",

    "question": "If cancer is just cells mutating and dividing without abandon , how does it cause the \" rot \" we see in later stages ? Title . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The cancerous \" rot \" you show below is a result of necrosis where the tumor has grown so much that it no longer get nutrients and oxygen from the blood supply . The cells on the interior of the tumor die . There are two types of cell death : apopotosis , which is tightly regulated , and necrosis , which is unregulated . Unregulated dying , as is the case in tumor rot , causes a cell to release all of its contents onto neighboring cells , causing those cells to necrose as well . This usually results in the entire area to start decomposing , causing secondary bacterial infections and general gross - ness . This is part of the reason why people with necrotising fasciitis ( flesh eating disease ) have to get entire areas of necrosis removed , like arms or legs or whatever to prevent the rot from spreading . Fortunately , in humans cancer rarely gets so bad that you see that extent of rot . Usually the tumor is palpable and can be treated or removed before huge rotting occurs .

    "answer": "Cancer is a group of diseases that are characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells in the body. When normal cells divide and grow, they follow a specific pattern that helps the body function properly. But when cancer cells develop, they don't follow this pattern and can grow out of control, forming a mass of tissue called a tumor. \nCancer cells can also spread to other parts of the body, where they can grow and form new tumors. This is called metastasis. When cancer cells spread to other parts of the body, they can interfere with the normal functioning of those organs and tissues, which can cause a variety of symptoms and complications. \nAs cancer cells grow and divide, they can interfere with the normal functioning of the body's tissues and organs. For example, a tumor in the lung may make it difficult for a person to breathe. A tumor in the stomach may cause a person to feel full and have trouble eating. And a tumor in the brain may cause a person to experience headaches and changes in their thinking or behavior. \nIn the later stages of cancer, the tumors may become very large and may begin to interfere with the body's vital functions, such as the ability to breathe or pump blood. The cancer may also spread to other parts of the body, which can lead to additional symptoms and complications. \nCancer can also weaken the body's immune system, making it more difficult for the body to fight off infections and other diseases. This can make a person more susceptible to getting sick and may cause additional complications. \nI hope this helps to explain cancer to you.

    "answer": "Cancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow and multiply in an uncontrolled way. When cancer cells form a mass or tumor, it can be treated by surgically removing the tumor. However, cancer cells can also spread, or metastasize, to other parts of the body. In this case, removing the tumor alone may not be enough to cure the cancer. \nFor example, if someone has testicular cancer and the cancer has spread to other parts of their body, such as their lymph nodes or lungs, removing the testicles (a procedure called orchiectomy) would not be sufficient to treat the cancer. In this case, the person would need additional treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, to kill any remaining cancer cells and prevent the cancer from returning. \nIt is important to note that in many cases, testicular cancer is caught early and can be treated with surgery alone. However, it is always important to discuss all treatment options with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action.",

    "question": "Why do humans have different bloodtypes ? URL_0 This was interesting Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "If you 're looking for the anatomical reason , it deals with the Red Blood Cell surfaces . RBCs are the cells that contain hemoglobin , which act to pick up / drop Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide in the blood stream to metabolically support and \" feed \" all of the cells in your body . An antigen is a protein on the surface of a cell that acts as a \" flag \" for the immune system . RBCs in a certain person contain contain types of antigens . In reality , there are thousands of antigens present , but in terms of labeling RBCs , there are 3 important ones : A , B , and D ( Rh ) . A person with a certain antigen of these three would also have blood plasma ( surrounding liquid around RBCs ) containing antibodies ( bind to the antigens ) for the other blood types . For example , a person with Type A blood would have antigens for Type B and D Blood . This is why you ca n't give blood to a person of a different blood type because the antibodies will react with your antigens on your RBCs , causing clumping and apoptosis . The Rh antigen brings the + /- factor that you often see on blood types . If Rh ( D ) is present , the type is + and the plasma contains no Rh antibodies . If Rh is not present on the surface , the type is - and the plasma contains Rh antibodies . Effectively , these are the blood types : A+ : contains A , D antigens and B antibodies A- : contains A antigens and B , D antibodies B+ : contains B , D antigens and A antibodies B- : contains B antigens and A , D antibodies AB+ : contains A , B , D antigens and no antibodies AB- : contains A , B antigens and D antibodies O+ : contains D antigens , and A , B antibodies O- : contains no antigens , and A , B , D antibodies This would make O- the universal donor blood type because the blood cells contain no antigens for which a recipient 's antibodies could react with . AB+ is the universal recipient because it has no antibodies in the plasma that could react with a donor 's blood 's antigens .",

    "question": "Why do humans have different bloodtypes ? URL_0 This was interesting Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Sure! The different blood types in humans are determined by proteins called antigens that are found on the surface of red blood cells. There are two main antigens: A and B. People can have either A, B, both A and B, or neither A and B. \nIf a person has the A antigen on their red blood cells, they are said to have type A blood. If they have the B antigen, they have type B blood. If they have both A and B antigens, they have type AB blood. And if they don't have either A or B antigens, they have type O blood. \nThe different blood types are important because they can affect whether or not a person can receive certain types of blood transfusions. For example, if a person with type A blood receives a transfusion of type B blood, their body may react to the B antigens and cause serious problems. This is why it's important to match the blood type of the donor and the recipient when giving a blood transfusion. \nI hope that helps to explain it! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

    "answer": "Rubber is a good insulator, which means that it does not conduct electricity well. When electricity flows through a conductor, it can create heat and cause the conductor to wear out over time. Rubber, on the other hand, does not conduct electricity well, so it does not create heat and does not wear out as easily. \nWhen rubber is used as a covering for a conductor, it can help to prevent the conductor from coming into contact with other materials that might conduct electricity. This can be important in situations where electricity could cause harm, such as when electrical wires are exposed. \nRubber is not the only material that can be used to insulate or protect against electricity. Other materials that are commonly used for this purpose include glass, plastic, and ceramic. These materials can also be used to help neutralize or prevent the flow of electricity.",

    "question": "Why do AM and FM radio signals sound so different ? A show I listen to on FM in the afternoons replays the next morning on AM , why does the AM station sound so much different ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Imagine writing out a message in your own handwriting , and later printing the same message with your printer . The letter will look wildly different . Your handwriting most likely is unclearer and more messy , but cheaper . Your printer makes everything perfectly clear and understandable , but printer ink is expensive . . AM and FM are separate methods of encoding and broadcasting radio signals . M works by modulating the amplitude of the signal according to the information being sent , while the frequency remains constant . This differs from FM technology in which sound is encoded by varying the frequency of the wave and the amplitude is kept constant . . This difference in signal type is what causes the sounds to change . AM has poorer sound quality compared with FM , but is cheaper and includes lower bandwidth making it ideal for having many stations in a small broadcast range . FM has a sharper quality at the cost of higher bandwidth , but can be blocked by physical hindrances ( mountains or your wall ) making it much shorter range .",

    "answer": "AM and FM radio signals sound different because they use different methods to transmit information. AM stands for \"amplitude modulation,\" and FM stands for \"frequency modulation.\" \nIn AM radio, the strength or amplitude of the radio signal is used to carry the information, such as music or speech. The signal is sent out at a specific frequency, and the amplitude (or strength) of the signal is changed to transmit the information. \nIn FM radio, the frequency of the radio signal is used to carry the information. The signal is sent out at a specific frequency, and the frequency of the signal is changed slightly to transmit the information. \nBecause AM radio uses changes in the amplitude of the signal to transmit information, it can be more prone to interference from things like electrical storms or other sources of interference. This can make the sound quality of AM radio less clear than FM radio. FM radio, on the other hand, uses changes in the frequency of the signal to transmit information, which makes it less prone to interference and generally gives it better sound quality. \nI hope this helps!

So , lucid dreaming means the state in a dream where you know you Are in a dream . Usually this results in you waking up , but sometimes and for some People they stay in the dream state . Staying in the dream gives you the ability to influence the outcome . For example : I often had the Same Dreams over and over as a Child , often involving dinosaurs .

Crazy stuff happened , in puberty the dinosaurs mostly changed to naked women but at some point i just went back to regul\u00e4r Dreams . Now how do you train it ? I am far from an expert here , but as far as I know you should start with writing a dream diary . Immediatly After you wake up Focus on the dream , writing it down or speaking it into a recording Device . Do this every night and you will start to remember your Dreams more vividly . It takes time , but if you Look into what you write down you can often find certain patterns , helping you to understand how your own Dreams work . Focus before falling asleep , get the idea into your head that all That s comming is a dream and you want to remember it . It takes time , but it can certainly enhance your own personal sleeping quality . Also nothing could happen , it depends on the person .",

Some people believe that it is possible to train yourself to have lucid dreams, and there are a few different techniques that you can try to increase your chances of having one. \nOne way to train yourself to have a lucid dream is to keep a dream journal. Every morning after you wake up, write down everything you can remember about your dreams from the night before. This can help you become more aware of your dreams and may increase your chances of having a lucid dream. \nAnother technique is to do something called \"reality checking.\" This means that you regularly check during the day to see if you are awake or dreaming. For example, you can try to push your finger through your palm or look at a clock and then look away and look back to see if the time has changed. If you do this enough, you may start doing it in your dreams and realize that you are dreaming. \nThere are also some other techniques that you can try, such as setting an intention to have a lucid dream before you go to sleep, or trying to stay as awake as possible just before you fall asleep. \nOverall, whether or not it is possible to train yourself to have lucid dreams is still a topic of debate, and different people may have different experiences.

    "answer": "Infrared thermometers work by measuring the amount of thermal radiation (heat) emitted by an object. When an object is heated, it emits infrared radiation, which is a type of electromagnetic radiation that is not visible to the human eye but can be detected by certain sensors, such as those found in infrared thermometers. \nWhen an infrared thermometer is pointed at a mirror, the sensor in the thermometer detects the infrared radiation emitted by the surface of the mirror. This is because the mirror is reflecting the infrared radiation emitted by the object that the mirror is facing, so the sensor in the thermometer is able to detect the radiation coming from the surface of the mirror. \nIt's important to note that the infrared thermometer is not measuring the temperature of the object that the mirror is reflecting. Instead, it is measuring the temperature of the surface of the mirror itself. This is why an infrared thermometer will measure the temperature of a mirror's surface, rather than the surface that the mirror is reflecting.",

As the tape moves past the heads, the signals are converted into an electrical current, which is then amplified and played through the speakers of the VHS player. \nThe audio on a VHS tape is typically recorded in a format called \"analog audio,\" which means that the audio is stored as a continuous, wave-like signal on the tape. This is different from \"digital audio,\" which stores audio as a series of 1s and 0s. When you play a VHS tape, the audio is read from the tape and converted into sound waves that you can hear through the speakers. \nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

    "answer": "Microphones can and do repeat what they hear , and if the hear louder than the speakers are putting the sound out , you 'll get a feedback loop and hear that horrible ringing sound you hear so frequently with indie bands . Keys to reducing the effect : * Use a directional ( Cardiod pattern is a very common semi - directional mic , however other patterns such as supercardiod exist too ) microphone and point it away from the speakers * Do n't set the sensitivity of the mic ( or the gain ) too high , or you 'll risk creating positive feedback * Software can \" remember \" what it put out of the speakers and subtract a large part of the unintended signal that it would become part of microphone 's signal .",

    "answer": "When you are on a Skype call and you speak into your microphone, the microphone converts the sound waves of your voice into an electrical signal. This electrical signal is then sent through a wire (or wirelessly, if you are using a wireless microphone) to the computer or other device you are using for the Skype call. The computer processes the electrical signal and converts it back into sound waves, which are then played through the speakers for the other person on the call to hear. \nAt the same time, the other person's voice is also being captured by their microphone and converted into an electrical signal, which is sent to your computer. Your computer processes this electrical signal and plays the sound waves through your speakers so that you can hear the other person. \nThe microphone and the speakers are connected to different parts of the computer or device, so they do not interfere with each other. The microphone is able to pick up sound waves from your voice, but it is not able to pick up the sound waves that are being played through the speakers. Similarly, the speakers are able to play sound waves that are being sent to them, but they do not interfere with the microphone's ability to pick up sound waves. This is why you are able to have a conversation on Skype without the microphone repeating what it hears through the speakers.",

    "answer": "A libertarian philosophy is laissez - faire ( minimal interference from the government ) advocating only minimal state intervention in the lives of citizens . An anarchist philosophy is based on the absence of government , and we are self - governed . So one has a government that works minimally , and the other has no government .",

    "question": "Anarchy vs Libertarian What is the difference between libertarian philosophy and anarchist philosophy ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Sure! Libertarianism is a political philosophy that emphasizes individual freedom and liberty. It is based on the idea that people have the right to do what they want as long as they do not harm others. This means that people should be free to make their own choices about how they live their lives, as long as they do not hurt anyone else in the process. \nAnarchism is also a political philosophy, but it takes the idea of individual freedom and liberty even further. Anarchists believe that there should be no government or laws at all. Instead, they think that people should be free to make their own decisions and live their lives however they want, without interference from any authority. \nSo, the main difference between libertarianism and anarchism is that libertarians believe in some limited government, while anarchists believe in no government at all. Both philosophies value individual freedom, but they have different ideas about how much control the government should have over people's lives.",

    "answer": "When we see or do something startling or unexpected, our bodies often respond with a physical reaction called the \"fight or flight\" response. This is a natural instinct that helps us prepare to either fight or run away from a perceived threat. \nDuring the fight or flight response, our bodies release a hormone called adrenaline, which increases our heart rate and blood pressure. This can make our heart feel like it is racing or \"dropping,\" and can also cause us to feel scared or anxious. \nSometimes, when a teacher calls us over to their desk, we may not know what to expect and our brains may perceive this as a potential threat. This can trigger the fight or flight response and cause us to feel scared or anxious. \nIt's important to remember that these physical reactions are normal and can help us prepare to handle unexpected situations. However, if we feel scared or anxious a lot of the time, it might be helpful to talk to a trusted adult or a mental health professional for support.",

For example, MRI is often used to examine the brain and spinal cord, while X-rays are often used to examine bones. \n2. The type of information needed: Different types of scans can provide different types of information. For example, MRI can provide detailed images of soft tissues, while CT scans can provide detailed images of both soft tissues and bones. \n3. The patient's condition: Some types of scans may not be suitable for certain patients, such as those who have pacemakers or are pregnant. \n4. The availability of the equipment: Not all hospitals or clinics have all types of scanners, so the availability of the equipment may also play a role in the decision. \n5.

This started up right after people discovered that collectors would pay big bucks for their old Barbies , GI Joe 's or other toys . Ty manufactured a false demand by promising the cheap stuffed animals were an investment .

    "answer": "Beanie Babies were small stuffed animals that were popular in the 1990s. They were made by a company called Ty Inc., and each Beanie Baby was named and had a unique appearance. Some people believed that Beanie Babies would become valuable collectors' items because they were made in limited quantities and were thought to be well-made and cute. As a result, some people started buying Beanie Babies as an investment, thinking that they would be worth a lot of money in the future. \nHowever, it's important to note that not all Beanie Babies became valuable. In fact, many of them are not worth much at all. The value of a Beanie Baby depends on a number of factors, including its rarity, condition, and popularity. Some Beanie Babies that were made in small quantities or had special features, such as errors on their tags, became more valuable than others. However, it's important to remember that the value of any collectible item can change over time, and there is no guarantee that a Beanie Baby will increase in value.",

    "answer": "When you run a program as an administrator, it means that the program will have access to more system resources and will be able to make changes to your computer that a normal user might not be able to. This is useful for tasks that require higher privileges, such as installing software or making changes to system settings. \nHowever, it's also important to be careful when running programs as an administrator, because they can potentially cause harm to your system if they are not used correctly. For example, a program that is run as an administrator could delete important system files or make other changes that could cause your computer to stop working properly. \nBy requiring you to explicitly choose to run a program as an administrator, Windows helps to prevent accidental or malicious changes to your system. It also gives you more control over which programs have access to higher privileges, which can help to keep your system more secure.",

    "answer": "Boiling water is water that has reached a temperature of 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius) at sea level, at which point it begins to turn into steam. At this temperature, the water has a lot of energy, and the molecules are moving around very quickly. When you add something to boiling water, it can cook quickly because the hot water will transfer heat to the food or drink. \nVery hot water that is not boiling is water that is hot, but has not reached the boiling point. The temperature of this water will depend on how hot it is, but it will not be as hot as boiling water. When you add something to very hot, but not boiling water, it will not cook as quickly as it would in boiling water because the water does not have as much energy and the molecules are not moving around as quickly. This is why it is usually recommended to add things like tea bags or pasta to boiling water rather than very hot, but not boiling water.",

    "answer": "Yes, it is possible that the color you call red is different from the color that I call red. This is because the way we perceive colors can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the type of lighting we are in, the colors that are around us, and even our own personal experiences and associations with different colors. \nFor example, imagine that you are standing in a room with bright red walls. If I were to show you a picture of a tomato and ask you to describe its color, you might say \"red\" because the tomato's color is similar to the color of the walls. However, if I were standing in a room with white walls and showed you the same picture of a tomato, I might describe its color as \"orange\" because the tomato's color would appear differently to me in the different lighting. \nSo, while we may both use the same word to describe a color, we might be perceiving that color differently based on our own individual experiences and surroundings.",

    "question": "What actually happens when a random command is issued to a computer ? How does the computer compute something random ? e.g. songs on shuffle , random integer generators etc . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "When you give a computer a command to do something random, it uses a special program called a \"random number generator\" to come up with a random answer. A random number generator is like a machine that can spit out any number at all, and it's really hard to predict what number it will spit out next. \nFor example, if you tell a computer to play a song on shuffle, it might use a random number generator to decide which song to play first. It might choose a number between 1 and 100, and then it will look at a list of 100 songs and play the one that corresponds to the number it chose. \nSimilarly, if you ask a computer to generate a random integer (a whole number like 1, 2, 3, etc.), it will use a random number generator to come up with a number. You can specify a range of numbers that you want the computer to choose from, like \"pick a random number between 1 and 10,\" and the computer will use its random number generator to choose a number within that range. \nI hope that helps!

    "question": "What Happens In Your Body The Exact Moment You Fall Asleep ? Wow Guys , thanks for all your answers ! ! ! ! I learned so much today ! Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "See , you do n't actually fall asleep all at once . It 's more of a well - defined process that everyone makes their way through in their own time . I 'll attempt to explain it . ----------------------------------------------------------------------- You start off moving into what 's called Stage 1 , from being completely awake . When you first lay down to go to sleep , you pass from your awake state to what 's called Alpha state . You 've daydreamed before , right ? That 's basically Alpha state . You 're still mostly conscious , but you start to see some little bouts of color behind your eyes ( hypnogogic hallucinations ) and you start to feel more relaxed . After Alpha , you enter Theta state . Theta state is when you could technically be considered asleep . This is when you move completely into sleep paralysis ( have you felt like you were falling then woken up with a start ? that 's sleep paralysis setting in and you not being completely unaware when it happened ) . You 're still sleeping relatively lightly , but if you can get through this stage you move into deeper sleep . ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The next major stage of sleep is called Stage 2 . Your brain starts to produce short periods of rapid brain waves that are called Sleep Spindles . This is the precursor to what comes next in sleep , deep sleep . Your body temperature begins to drop and your heart rate slows down , settling you in for the night . ------------------------------------------------------------------------ You then enter Stage 3 . When you enter stage 3 , really slow brain waves called Delta waves start happening . This is the true transition between light and deep sleep . ------------------------------------------------------------------------ You then enter Stage 4 . Stage four is commonly referred to as Delta Sleep because of the brain waves associated with it . It 's a deep sleep that lasts for about thirty minutes . You are the technically the most asleep in this stage . ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Here 's where it gets interesting . There is another stage of sleep unlike all the others . It 's called Stage 5 , or REM sleep . REM stands for Rapid Eye Movement , your eyes literally start moving rapidly behind your eyelids . Your breathing rate increases , and your brain waves shoot up to almost as active as if you were awake . Your voluntary muscles become completely paralyzed , and you start dreaming . REM is also where most of the body 's repairs happen . REM sleep is what makes you feel rested when you wake up , and where the body actually rests and restores itself ( which is why you usually do n't feel rested after a night of drinking or smoking weed , they both inhibit REM sleep ) . ----------------------------------------------------------------------- These stages come in cycles . It takes roughly 90 minutes for you to go from awake into REM . The first cycle typically has a short REM period , but subsequent cycles increase the duration of REM . When we actually fall asleep , we go from stage 1 into 2 , then 3 , then 4 , but here 's where something curious happens . We then go from 4 to 3 , then 3 to 2 , then into REM . After REM , we usually return to stage 2 , then go back to 3 , 4 , then 3 , 2 , REM . We have as many cycles as we stay asleep for , when we wake up , feeling refreshed and ready or the day . ------------------------------------------------------------------------ I do n't know if that answered your question , but I hope it shed some light on the subject . Edit : formatting . Edit 2 : I 'll be here if anyone has any other questions they 'd like answered about this topic . Edit 3 : Holy crap ! Thanks for popping my gold cherry anon !

    "answer": "When you fall asleep, your body goes through a series of changes. Here's what happens: \n1. Your muscles start to relax: As you start to fall asleep, your muscles begin to relax, especially in your face, neck, and limbs. You might notice that your arms and legs feel heavy and you might feel a tingling sensation in your hands and feet. \n2. Your breathing and heart rate slow down: As you fall deeper into sleep, your breathing and heart rate slow down. You might notice that your breaths become slower and deeper, and your heart rate becomes more regular. \n3. Your brain waves change: There are different types of brain waves, and the type of brain wave you have depends on what you're doing. When you're awake, your brain waves are fast and active. But as you fall asleep, your brain waves slow down and become more regular. \n4. Your body temperature drops: As you fall asleep, your body temperature drops slightly. This is why you might feel cold when you first go to bed, but then warm up as you fall asleep. \n5. Your body enters different stages of sleep: There are two main types of sleep: REM (rapid eye movement) sleep and non-REM sleep. Non-REM sleep is divided into three stages: light sleep, deep sleep, and very deep sleep. As you fall asleep, you move through these stages of sleep in a cycle that lasts about 90 minutes. \nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why people around the world might not use the local language to refer to other countries. Here are a few: \n1. History: Some countries have long histories of colonizing or being colonized by other countries. This can lead to the names of those countries being adopted in other languages. For example, \"Deutschland\" (Germany's name in German) might be called \"Germany\" in English because English speakers have a long history of interacting with Germany and its people. \n2. Language: English is spoken by a large number of people around the world and is often used as a common language for communication between people who speak different languages. This means that many people might use the English names for countries when they are communicating with someone who speaks a different language. \n3. Convenience: It can be easier to use a country's name in a common language like English because it is a name that is familiar to many people. Using a country's local name might be confusing to some people who are not familiar with the language. \nOverall, there are a variety of reasons why people might not use the local language to refer to countries.

In the United States, the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution protects citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government. This means that law enforcement officers generally need a warrant to search a person's home or property, and they must follow certain procedures when doing so. \nOne of these procedures is the \"knock and announce\" rule, which requires officers to announce their presence and purpose before entering a property. However, in some cases, officers may be able to get a no-knock warrant, which allows them to enter a property without first announcing their presence. \nNo-knock warrants are generally only granted in cases where there is a risk of danger to the officers or the public, or a risk that evidence might be destroyed if the officers announce their presence. In order to get a no-knock warrant, law enforcement officers must provide a judge with evidence that there is a good reason to bypass the knock and announce rule. \nThe Supreme Court has ruled that no-knock warrants are constitutional as long as they are used in a reasonable manner. This means that officers must have a good reason for using a no-knock warrant, and they must follow all other rules and procedures when executing the warrant. However, there have been cases where no-knock warrants have been used improperly, leading to controversy and calls for reform.",

    "answer": "On a gas stove, the flame is produced when gas flows from the gas line and is mixed with oxygen from the air. The gas is ignited by a spark from the stove's ignition system, which is usually a small electrical device that generates a spark when you turn the burner knob to \"light.\" \nThe flame is contained within the burner and does not travel down the gas line because the gas is mixed with just the right amount of oxygen to produce a flame that is stable and does not spread. The burner also has a design that helps contain the flame, such as a small metal ring around the edge of the burner that helps direct the flame upwards. \nSo, in short, the flame on a gas stove is kept from traveling down the gas line because the gas is mixed with the right amount of oxygen, and the burner is designed to contain the flame.",

    "question": "In a world filled with online anonymity . What is stopping a Valve or Bethesda employee from spilling the beans on projects that everyone is waiting for ? Fallout 4 ? Half life 3 ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "There are a few reasons why a Valve or Bethesda employee might not spill the beans on projects that everyone is waiting for, even if they have the ability to do so anonymously online. \nFirst, most companies have strict policies in place to protect company secrets. Employees are typically required to sign non-disclosure agreements, which means that they are not allowed to share confidential information about the company or its projects with anyone outside the company. If an employee were to violate this agreement, they could face serious consequences, such as losing their job or being sued by the company. \nSecond, most employees understand that leaking information about a project could harm the company and their own careers. If an employee were to leak information about a project that is not ready to be announced, it could ruin the surprise and create disappointment among fans. It could also harm the company's reputation and make it harder for the company to successfully launch the project in the future. \nFinally, most employees are professional and take pride in their work. They want to see a project succeed and be appreciated by its intended audience, and leaking information about it prematurely would not help that happen.",

    "question": "Why is the letter \" W \" pronounced \" double - u \" when \" double - v \" would seem to be more accurate ? Also , \" W \" is the only letter in the alphabet with more than one syllable . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "This goes back to the time when U and V were actually the same letter ; so , in fact , were I and J. This is what the classical Latin alphabet looked like : A B C D E F G H I K L M N O P Q R S T V X Y Z But in handwriting , it looked a bit more like this : * a b c d e f g h j k l m n o p q r s t u x y z * Notice that in the capital letters , there is no J or U ; and in the cursive letters , no * i * or * v * . Instead , you had the following capital / cursive pairs : I*j * and V*u * . So the name \" Julius \" would , in Latin , be carved in stone as \" IVLIVS \" , but written by hand as \" * juljus * \" . These letters could be used as vowels or consonants ; so the letter \" I \" as a vowel had a sound like the \" i \" in \" sit \" , and as a consonant a sound like the \" y \" in \" yes \" ; the letter \" V \" had as a vowel a sound like the \" u \" in \" put \" , and as a consonant ... well , it was either like our \" w \" , or like our \" v \" . The smart money is on \" w \" , but there were no tape recorders in those days so we ca n't be sure . But a word like \" * uacuum * \" might have been pronounced \" wack - woom \" , and explains why our word \" vacuum \" has two Us in it . The phrase \" * uenj ujdj ujcj * \" , which we usually spell \" veni vidi vici \" ( \" I came , I saw , I conquered \" ) might have been pronounced \" wenny weedy weeky \" or \" wenny weedy wee - chee \" ( again , we ca n't be sure ) . When the Roman alphabet was used to write other languages , those other languages often had sounds that did n't exist in Latin . Sometimes they added extra letters ( for example , the letters \u00d0 and \u00de , which are still used in modern Icelandic ) , sometimes they put two or more letters together to make a new sound ( for example , our TH ) . For some languages , a new letter was created by doubling the letter V -- so VV ; or , in cursive , * uu * . Hence the name , \" double - U \" . But additionally , the letters I and V were \" split \" , to make two versions of each -- originally , one for the vowel and one for the consonant . So the letter I*j * was split to make Ii for the vowel and Jj for the consonant ( which in modern English is now pronounced differently -- in modern German it 's still pronounced like our Y ) ; V*u * was similarly split to make Uu ( vowel ) and Vv ( consonant ) . The W took on the form of the V , but we kept the name \" double - U \" . This is actually appropriate , because the English \" w \" sound is , in effect , a very short \" u \" sound . Languages like French did n't originally have this letter , because it was n't needed -- except for writing foreign words , like \" le weekend \" . But since the W now looks like two Vs , the French called it \" double - V \" . Incidentally , although you might not think it , the sounds of \" W \" and \" V \" are , phonetically , very closely related . Native English speakers can hear the difference so clearly they do n't realise how similar they are ; many Germans , however , find it very difficult , and often confuse the sounds , saying \" wiolin \" instead of \" violin \" , for example . Both sounds are also very closely related to \" U \" .",

    "question": "Why is the letter \" W \" pronounced \" double - u \" when \" double - v \" would seem to be more accurate ? Also , \" W \" is the only letter in the alphabet with more than one syllable . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Great question! The letter \"W\" is pronounced \"double-u\" because that's how it has been traditionally pronounced in English. In fact, the letter \"W\" is not the only letter in the alphabet with more than one syllable - the letter \"A\" is also pronounced with two syllables when it is used as a long vowel sound, as in the word \"paint.\" \nThe letter \"W\" was originally derived from the runic symbol \"wynn,\" which was used to represent the sound \"w\" in Old English. Over time, the letter \"W\" came to be pronounced as \"double-u,\" even though it might seem more logical to pronounce it as \"double-v.\" \nOne reason for this is that the letter \"V\" and the letter \"W\" have very different histories and origins. The letter \"V\" comes from the Latin letter \"V,\" which was used to represent the sound \"v.\" On the other hand, the letter \"W\" comes from the runic symbol \"wynn,\" which was used to represent the sound \"w\" in Old English. As a result, the letters \"V\" and \"W\" have always had different sounds and pronunciations, even though they look similar. \nI hope this helps to clear things up!",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why people might sound different in old TV shows and radio broadcasts compared to more modern productions. \nOne reason is that the technology for recording and reproducing sound has improved over time. In the past, the equipment that was used to record sound was not as advanced as it is today, so the quality of the sound might not be as good. This can make it seem like people are speaking in a different way. \nAnother reason is that the way people spoke and the way that language was used has changed over time. Just like how people's fashion and the way they do things changes, the way people speak and use language changes too. This can make it seem like people are speaking in a different way, even if the sound quality is good. \nFinally, it's also possible that the acting styles or the way that dialogue was written in older TV shows and radio broadcasts was different from what we're used to today.

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why people in some parts of the world, such as the Netherlands and other Western European countries, are taller on average than people in other parts of the world. One reason is genetics. People inherit traits such as height from their parents, and certain genetic traits that contribute to taller height may be more common in some populations than in others. \nAnother reason is nutrition. People who have access to a varied and nutritious diet are more likely to grow to be tall and healthy. This is especially true during childhood and adolescence, when the body is still growing. In the past, people in the Netherlands and other Western European countries may have had better access to nutritious food, which could have contributed to their taller average height. \nThere are also other factors that can affect height, such as health care and living conditions. People who live in countries with good health care and safe, clean living conditions are more likely to grow to be tall and healthy. So, the combination of genetics, nutrition, and other factors has likely contributed to the taller average height of people in the Netherlands and other Western European countries.",

    "answer": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a particle accelerator, not a heat source. It is designed to collide particles together at very high energies, but these collisions do not produce heat in the way that burning a piece of wood does. Instead, the energy of the collisions is converted into other forms of energy, such as the kinetic energy of the particles that are produced in the collision or the energy of new particles that are created. \nTo understand how the LHC works, it helps to think about a simpler example: two cars colliding head-on at high speed. When the cars collide, they transfer their kinetic energy (the energy they have due to their motion) to each other. This energy can be converted into other forms of energy, such as the sound of the collision or the heat that is produced as the cars deform and the materials they are made of stretch and break. \nSimilarly, when particles collide in the LHC, they transfer their energy to each other, and this energy can be converted into various forms. The LHC is designed to produce very high-energy collisions, but the energy of the collisions is spread out over a very small volume, so it does not produce a significant amount of heat. \nI hope this helps to clarify how the LHC works and why it does not produce enough heat to burn a hole through the planet!

    "answer": "Our eyes are able to move independently to some extent, but they also have the ability to move together in the same direction. This is because our eyes are controlled by muscles and nerves that work together to allow us to move them. \nWhen we want to look at something, our brains send a signal to the muscles in our eyes telling them which way to move. These muscles are called extraocular muscles, and they are responsible for moving our eyes in different directions. \nThere are several benefits to being able to move our eyes together. For one, it allows us to have better depth perception, which is the ability to judge the distance of objects from us. When we look at an object, our brain uses the difference in the images that our two eyes see to determine how far away the object is. \nAdditionally, being able to move our eyes together helps us to track moving objects more easily. For example, if we are watching a bird fly through the sky, our eyes will move together to follow the bird as it moves. This helps us to keep the bird in focus and see it more clearly. \nSo in short, our eyes are able to move independently to some extent, but they also have the ability to move together in the same direction.

    "question": "Why ca n't you eat tea leaves ? Certain plants are eaten as is and others are brewed to make tea . Can you just eat a tea leaf ? Why or why not ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Tea leaves are generally not eaten because they are not very tasty on their own and can be quite bitter. Instead, tea leaves are usually dried and then brewed to make a hot beverage called tea. To make tea, the dried tea leaves are steeped in hot water to extract their flavor and aromas. The resulting liquid is then strained and served. \nEating tea leaves may not be harmful to your health, but they are not usually considered a food and are not a good source of nutrients. Additionally, some types of tea leaves may contain compounds that can cause digestive issues if consumed in large amounts. \nSo while it is technically possible to eat tea leaves, it is not a common practice and is not generally recommended. It is much more enjoyable to enjoy tea leaves as a hot, flavorful beverage.",

    "answer": "Porn sites, like any other websites, may display ads to generate revenue. These ads may come from various advertising networks, which act as intermediaries between websites and advertisers. Some of these advertisers may use tactics that are not ethical or legal, such as creating pop-up ads that contain malicious software (also known as malware) or attempting to trick people into clicking on ads by using misleading or deceptive tactics. \nPorn sites may not always be aware that the ads they are displaying contain malware or are using deceptive tactics. This can happen because the advertisers may use techniques to disguise their ads or because the porn sites may not have sufficient safeguards in place to detect and prevent the display of malicious or deceptive ads. \nIt is not legal for companies to pay porn sites to display ads that contain malware or use deceptive tactics. However, it can be difficult for law enforcement to track down and prosecute the individuals or organizations responsible for these kinds of activities, which is why they continue to happen.",

    "answer": "Your brain doesn't actually have a \"voice\" like you might think of it. When you hear a voice in your head, it's actually just your own thoughts. The reason you experience your thoughts as coming from inside your head is because that's where your brain is located. Your brain is the organ that controls all of your thoughts, movements, and sensations, so it makes sense that you would feel like your thoughts are coming from inside your head. \nAs for why you can't \"move\" the location of your thoughts, it's because your thoughts are just electrical and chemical activity happening in your brain. You don't have any direct control over this activity, so you can't really control where your thoughts seem to be coming from. \nThe frontal lobe is a part of the brain that is involved in things like thinking, planning, and decision-making, but it's not the only part of the brain that's involved in these processes. Your thoughts and perceptions come from activity in many different parts of your brain, not just the frontal lobe. \nIt's also not about discipline. You don't have any control over where your thoughts seem to come from, so it's not a matter of discipline or lack thereof.",

    "answer": "Sure! Let's pretend that you have a cookie jar that represents your virtual currency, and each cookie in the jar represents one unit of your virtual currency. When you bought $200 worth of virtual currency, you were essentially buying a certain number of cookies from someone else. \nNow, imagine that the value of each cookie can change over time, just like the value of a real-world currency like the US dollar can change. If the value of each cookie goes up, then the total value of all the cookies in your jar will also go up. \nFor example, let's say that when you bought your cookies, each one was worth $1. But over the next four years, the value of each cookie goes up to $10. If you have 200 cookies in your jar, then the total value of your cookies would be 200 cookies * $10 per cookie = $2,000. \nNow, let's say that the value of each cookie goes up even more, to $12. If you have 200 cookies in your jar, then the total value of your cookies would be 200 cookies * $12 per cookie = $2,400. \nSo, if the value of each unit of your virtual currency goes up over time, then the total value of your virtual currency can also go up. That's how $200 worth of virtual currency can turn into $2.4 million in four years.",

FM stands for \"frequency modulation,\" which refers to the way that the radio station sends its signal over the airwaves. FM radio uses higher frequency waves to transmit the signal, and these waves are able to carry more information and provide better sound quality. AM radio, on the other hand, stands for \"amplitude modulation\" and uses lower frequency waves that are not able to transmit as much information or provide as good of sound quality.

    "answer": "The official internet domains for the United Kingdom, Australia, and other countries do not end with \".uk\" or \".au.\" Instead, they use the top-level domains (TLDs) \".co.uk\" and \".com.au,\" respectively. These TLDs are part of the Domain Name System (DNS), which is a system that translates domain names (like google.com) into numerical IP addresses that computers can understand and use to communicate with each other over the internet. \nThe TLDs \".co.uk\" and \".com.au\" are used to indicate the country where a website is registered or based. In the case of the United Kingdom, the \".co.uk\" TLD is used for commercial websites, while the \".uk\" TLD is used for other types of websites, such as government, education, and personal websites. Similarly, in Australia, the \".com.au\" TLD is used for commercial websites, while other TLDs, such as \".edu.au\" and \".gov.au,\" are used for educational and government websites, respectively. \nThere are many different TLDs available for use, and they can be either two letters (like \".uk\" and \".au\") or more.

    "answer": "I can certainly help you explain to your friend that the video they saw is not a video of Russians dropping a nuke on Ukraine and that World War III has not started. \nFirst of all, it's important to understand that a nuclear weapon is a very powerful bomb that can cause a lot of destruction. It's not something that is used lightly, and countries try to avoid using them because of the potential for widespread devastation. \nThe video that your friend saw is likely a simulation or a mock-up of what a nuclear explosion might look like. It is not an actual event that is happening in the world. It is likely that the video was created as a way to educate people about the dangers of nuclear weapons or as a way to show what might happen if a nuclear weapon were used. \nIt's also important to understand that there is no current conflict between Russia and Ukraine that would justify the use of a nuclear weapon. While there have been tensions between the two countries in the past, they are not currently at war with each other. \nIn short, the video that your friend saw is not real and does not represent an actual event.

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why games like Destiny may not be able to be played across different platforms, such as the Xbox 360 and Xbox One. One reason is that the hardware and software of the different platforms may not be compatible with each other. For example, the Xbox 360 and Xbox One have different processors, graphics cards, and operating systems, which means that the game would need to be specifically designed to work on both platforms in order for cross-platform play to be possible. \nAnother reason is that the game's developer may not have made cross-platform play a priority or may not have the resources to make it possible. This could be because it is a technical challenge, or because the developer wants to keep the player bases for each platform separate in order to maintain a balanced and fair game experience for all players. \nFinally, there may be business or legal reasons why a game like Destiny cannot be played across different platforms. For example, the game may be owned or published by a company that has exclusive agreements with certain platforms, or there may be licensing issues that prevent the game from being played on certain platforms.",

    "question": "Why is my singing voice so much deeper just after waking up ? I notice I can hit notes lower than normal just after waking up from sleep . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "When you sleep, your body goes into a state of relaxation, which can affect the muscles in your throat and vocal cords. As a result, your singing voice may sound deeper just after waking up because the muscles in your throat and vocal cords are relaxed and not as tense as they usually are. This can allow your vocal cords to vibrate more freely, which can produce a lower pitch. \nIt's important to warm up your voice before singing or speaking for extended periods of time, especially if you've just woken up. This can help to get your vocal muscles ready to produce sound and prevent strain or injury to your voice. \nSo, in short, your singing voice may sound deeper just after waking up because your vocal muscles are relaxed and not as tense as they usually are, which can allow your vocal cords to vibrate more freely and produce a lower pitch.",

    "answer": "The Cheytac Intervention is a long-range sniper rifle that is known for its accuracy and consistent groupings at extreme ranges. However, it is not widely used by major militaries for a variety of reasons. \nOne reason is that the rifle is relatively expensive to produce and maintain. It uses a unique caliber (.408 Cheytac) that requires specialized ammunition, which can also be expensive to produce in large quantities. \nAnother reason is that the rifle is relatively large and heavy, which can make it less practical for certain types of operations or for soldiers who need to carry a lot of other equipment. \nFinally, the rifle is not necessarily the best choice for every situation. Different militaries have different requirements for their firearms, and they may choose different types of rifles based on their specific needs. For example, a military might choose a rifle that is more lightweight and portable for use in urban environments, even if it is not as accurate at long ranges as the Cheytac Intervention. \nOverall, the Cheytac Intervention is a highly specialized rifle that is designed for specific types of long-range shooting. While it is certainly a very effective rifle for those types of situations, it may not be the best choice for all situations, which is why it is not used more widely by major militaries.",

    "answer": "Marijuana is still illegal at the federal level in the United States, despite the fact that many states have legalized it for medical or recreational purposes. In order for marijuana to be federally legalized, it would require a change in the law. \nThe process for changing a federal law in the United States involves several steps. First, a bill (a proposed law) must be introduced in Congress. This bill must then be debated and voted on by members of the House of Representatives and the Senate. If the bill passes in both chambers, it goes to the President to be signed into law. \nThere are several ways that a bill can become a law, but this is the most common process. It can be a long and difficult process, and it requires the support of a majority of lawmakers and the President. \nSo, in order for marijuana to be federally legalized, a bill would need to be introduced in Congress, debated and voted on, and then signed into law by the President.

    "answer": "The chain rule . When you write sin^2 x ( a convenient notation ) as ( sin x)^2 the derivative is 2(sin x ) times the derivative of what is inside , which is cos x.

Write x^2 as ( x)^2 which has derivative 2x times the derivative of what is inside , which is 1 , but anything times 1 is itself so the derivative is just 2x . In general , the derivative of any differentiable function of the form f(g(x ) ) is f'(g(x))g'(x ) where f ' and g ' are the respective derivatives of f and g , and this is the chain rule . In your example , f(x)=x^2 and g(x)=sin x.

    "answer": "Derivatives and integrals are operations that allow us to find the rate of change of a function or the area under a curve, respectively. The derivative of a function tells us how the function is changing at any given point, and the integral of a function gives us the total amount that the function has changed over a certain interval. \nThe derivative of x^2 is 2x because x^2 is increasing at a rate of 2x at every point. In other words, if x is increasing by a small amount, then x^2 is increasing by twice that amount. This relationship is captured by the derivative of x^2, which is 2x. \nThe derivative of sin^2 x, on the other hand, is not equal to 2 sin x. The derivative of sin^2 x is actually 2 sin x cos x. This is because sin^2 x is not increasing at a constant rate like x^2. Instead, the rate at which sin^2 x is increasing depends on the value of sin x and cos x at that point. When sin x is large and cos x is small, sin^2 x is increasing quickly. When sin x is small and cos x is large, sin^2 x is increasing more slowly. The derivative of sin^2 x takes this changing rate of change into account. \nSimilarly, the integral of x is x^2/2 because the total amount that x has changed over a certain interval can be represented by the area of a rectangle with base x and height x/2. The integral of sin x or cos x, on the other hand, cannot be represented by a simple polynomial like x^2/2. Instead, these functions require more complex mathematical expressions to describe their total change over an interval.",

    "answer": "The ribs are bones that are attached to the spine and help protect the organs in the chest, such as the heart and lungs. While the ribs are generally not able to move or expand on their own, they do move slightly when we breathe. \nWhen we inhale, or take a deep breath in, the muscles between the ribs, called the intercostal muscles, contract and pull the ribs upwards and outwards. This expands the chest cavity and creates more space for the lungs to fill with air. When we exhale, or breathe out, the intercostal muscles relax and the ribs return to their normal position. \nSo, while the ribs themselves do not expand, the chest cavity can expand and contract when we breathe, which can make it seem like the ribs are expanding. This is an important part of the process of breathing and helps us get the oxygen we need to survive.",

Blu-ray discs are able to hold a lot more data than DVDs, which is why they are able to store large files like video games. \nOn the other hand, seasons of shows or movies may be stored on multiple DVDs because they may not fit on a single DVD. This is because DVDs can hold less data than Blu-ray discs. \nThink of it like a bucket. A Blu-ray disc is like a large bucket that can hold a lot of water (data). A DVD is like a smaller bucket that can hold less water. If you have a lot of water (data) to store, you might need to use multiple smaller buckets (DVDs) to hold it all.

They are made of large blocks of stone, which are much less prone to weathering and erosion than softer materials like sand or dirt. The stones were also cut and fitted together very carefully, which has helped them to stay in place over time. \nThe pyramids are also located in a desert region, where there is not a lot of rain or other types of weather that can cause erosion. The dry climate has also helped to preserve the pyramids, as there is no moisture in the air to wear away the stones. \nIn addition, the pyramids are located in a relatively isolated area, which means they are not exposed to a lot of foot traffic or other types of wear and tear that can damage them. All of these factors have contributed to the pyramids' longevity, and that's why they are still standing after all these years.",

    "question": "Why race car tires have more traction without treads but consumer tires have more traction with treads . Uh , see title . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Not including the compound of the rubber ( race ties being softer , and usually of a different chemical makeup ) , the difference comes down to water and heat cycles . Race tires without treads make the most contact , but they are used only in the dry . Consumer tires have to handle multiple conditions , including water . The treads channel water away from the tires surface , allowing the tire to make contact with the road instead of floating on top of the water . Consumer tires have far less traction when \" bald \" usually due to heat cycling , and the fact the the compound at that level is often different than the compound at the surface when a tire is newer . Heat cycling is essentially the hardening of the rubber each time the tire warms up and cools down . The harder the tire , the less grip . Many racers that are restricted to \" street \" tires will often shave tread off of brand new tires to reduce the amount of tread \" squirm \" and often get to a different compound ( if the tire is molded in such a way ) .",

    "question": "Why race car tires have more traction without treads but consumer tires have more traction with treads . Uh , see title . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Race car tires are designed to provide maximum grip and traction on a racetrack. They are made of a special rubber compound that is very sticky and helps the tires adhere to the track surface. In addition, race car tires are generally very smooth and have no treads. This is because treads can actually reduce grip on a smooth surface like a racetrack. \nOn the other hand, consumer tires are designed to be used on the road and are therefore built to handle a variety of surfaces and conditions. Treads on consumer tires help to provide grip on wet or slippery roads by channeling water away from the tire and increasing the tire's contact with the road. Treads also help to provide traction on loose or uneven surfaces, such as gravel or dirt roads. \nIn summary, race car tires have more traction without treads because they are designed specifically for use on smooth, dry racetracks. Consumer tires have more traction with treads because they need to be able to handle a variety of road conditions, including wet and slippery surfaces.",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why we still have wires and cables. \nFirst, wires and cables can transmit large amounts of data quickly and reliably. For example, if you want to download a movie or stream high-definition video, a wired connection can provide a faster and more stable connection than a wireless one. \nSecond, wireless technologies have limits on the distance they can transmit data. This means that if you want to connect devices that are far apart, you may need to use a wired connection. \nFinally, some devices simply work better with a wired connection. For example, a wired mouse might be more accurate and responsive than a wireless one. \nOverall, while wireless technologies have come a long way and have many advantages, there are still situations where a wired connection is the best choice.",

    "answer": "Grocery stores often have high ceilings for a few reasons. One reason is that high ceilings can make a space feel bigger and more open, which can be more appealing to customers. This is especially important in stores that are crowded or have a lot of merchandise, as it can help to create a sense of space and make the store feel less cluttered. \nAnother reason is that high ceilings can help to improve the lighting in a store. Higher ceilings allow for the use of more and bigger windows, which can bring in more natural light. This can create a brighter, more welcoming atmosphere and make it easier for customers to see and navigate the store. \nAdditionally, high ceilings can also help with air circulation and temperature control. Air can circulate more freely in a space with high ceilings, which can help to keep the store cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. This can make the store more comfortable for customers and employees, which can be important for customer satisfaction. \nOverall, while high ceilings may increase initial building costs and heating costs, they can also have many benefits that make them worth it for grocery stores.",

    "answer": "Punching through solid objects like wood or brick is not something that can be done by most people, and it is not a common or practical technique in martial arts. In fact, attempting to punch through hard surfaces can cause serious injury to the hand and wrist, as well as damage the object being punched. \nHowever, some people may demonstrate the ability to break certain objects, such as wood or brick, using techniques that involve striking the object with a focused, precise force. This is typically done using a combination of physical strength, speed, and technique, as well as proper conditioning of the hand and wrist to withstand the impact. \nThe scientific explanation for this phenomenon is that the force of the punch is concentrated on a small area, allowing the punch to break the object. In addition, the object being punched may have imperfections or weaknesses that allow it to break more easily when struck. \nIt's important to note that breaking objects is not a common or necessary skill in martial arts, and attempting to do so can be dangerous. It's always important to train safely and use proper protective equipment to prevent injury.",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why other vehicle manufacturers may not be using Tesla's batteries: \n1. Intellectual property: Tesla has invested a lot of time and resources into developing their batteries, and they may have patented certain aspects of their technology. This means that other companies would need to get permission from Tesla to use their batteries, which could be difficult or expensive. \n2. Cost: Tesla's batteries may be more expensive than those produced by other companies, which could make them less attractive to other manufacturers. \n3. Compatibility: Tesla's batteries are designed specifically for use in their own vehicles, and may not be compatible with the vehicles produced by other manufacturers. This means that other companies would need to make significant modifications to their vehicles in order to use Tesla's batteries. \n4. Different priorities: Different companies may have different priorities when it comes to the technology they use in their vehicles. Some companies may prioritize low cost over performance, while others may prioritize performance over cost. Tesla's batteries may not be the best fit for every company's needs. \nIn summary, there are a number of factors that may influence whether or not other vehicle manufacturers decide to use Tesla's batteries, including intellectual property considerations, cost, compatibility, and different priorities.",

Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Countries have nuclear weapons because they believe that they make them safer. Some countries believe that having nuclear weapons deters other countries from attacking them because the consequences would be so devastating. \nImagine that you are a leader of a country and another country has a lot of nuclear weapons. If that country threatened to attack you, you might feel very scared and vulnerable. You might want to protect your own country by getting your own nuclear weapons. That way, if the other country tries to attack you, you can threaten to use your nuclear weapons in response. This is called \"deterrence.\" \nHaving nuclear weapons can also make a country feel more powerful and respected by other countries. Some countries might want to have nuclear weapons so that they can have more influence on the world stage and be taken more seriously by other countries. \nIt's important to remember that nuclear weapons are very dangerous and should never be used. Most countries have signed a treaty called the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which is an agreement to not build new nuclear weapons or help other countries build them. However, some countries have not signed the NPT and have continued to develop nuclear weapons.",

    "question": "What does it mean to refinance a house ? I know someone who is refinancing their house . He was telling me about it , but I really could n't follow . So what happens ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Most people take out a loan to buy a house and they use the house as collateral for the loan . This means that if you do n't pay the loan , the bank can take the house and sell it to get its money back . These loans are called mortgages .

You once again use your house as collateral for the new loan and now have a mortgage with a different lender . People refinance to get better terms on their mortgage . If your original mortgage has an interest rate of 6 % but you can get a new one with a 4 % interest rate you can save money by refinancing . Reasons you may be able to get a lower interest rate include better credit on your part ( maybe your credit score rose since you took out the original loan ) or a better lending environment ( federal interest rates are low so banks are generally giving lower interest loans ) .",

    "question": "What does it mean to refinance a house ? I know someone who is refinancing their house . He was telling me about it , but I really could n't follow . So what happens ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "When you refinance a house, you are essentially taking out a new loan to pay off your existing mortgage. This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as to get a lower interest rate, to change the length of the loan, or to access the equity you have built up in your home. \nHere's an example of how refinancing might work: \nLet's say that you have a mortgage on your home with an interest rate of 5%. You've been paying on this mortgage for a few years and have built up some equity in your home. Now, you find out that you can refinance your mortgage and get a new loan with an interest rate of 4%. This would mean that you would be paying less in interest each month, which would lower your monthly mortgage payments. \nTo do this, you would need to apply for a new mortgage and go through the process of getting approved for the loan. Once you have been approved, the lender will pay off your old mortgage and give you a new loan with the lower interest rate. You will then make payments on this new loan instead of the old one. \nOverall, refinancing a house can be a good way to save money on your mortgage payments or to access the equity you have built up in your home. However, it's important to consider all of the costs associated with refinancing, such as closing costs, to make sure that it makes financial sense for you.",

    "question": "Why is there existence ? Why is there anything at all ? Deep thoughts .... Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "That's a very big and complex question that has puzzled philosophers, scientists, and thinkers for centuries. It's difficult to give a simple answer, but here is one way to think about it: \nEverything that exists has a cause or explanation for why it is the way it is. For example, if you have a pencil on your desk, you might wonder why it's there. The answer could be that someone put it there, or that you needed it for a task and got it out of a drawer. Either way, there is a reason or cause for why the pencil is on your desk. \nBut when we try to think about the whole universe and everything in it, it becomes more difficult to find a cause or explanation. If we ask why the universe exists, we might try to find something or someone that caused it to exist. But then we have to ask what caused that thing or person, and so on. This can lead to an infinite loop, where we keep asking \"why?\" but never find a final answer. \nOne possible way to think about the existence of the universe is that it simply exists, and there isn't necessarily a cause or explanation for why. This idea is sometimes called the \"principle of sufficient reason,\" and it suggests that the universe doesn't need a cause because it is a fundamental aspect of reality. \nIt's important to note that these are just some ways to think about the question of existence, and there is no one \"right\" answer. It's a topic that continues to be debated and explored by many people.",

    "answer": "Milk teeth, also known as baby teeth, are the first set of teeth that a child gets. These teeth are important because they help children learn to chew and speak properly, and they also hold space in the jaws for the permanent teeth that will come in later. \nMilk teeth are different from permanent teeth in a few ways. For one thing, they are smaller and more delicate than permanent teeth. They also have different shapes and are arranged differently in the mouth. Milk teeth also have thinner enamel, the hard outer layer that protects teeth, which makes them more prone to cavities. \nOne of the reasons that children lose their milk teeth is because they are simply not strong enough to last a lifetime. They were only meant to be temporary, and once the permanent teeth start to come in, the milk teeth are no longer needed. The permanent teeth are much stronger and will be able to do a better job of chewing and biting food. \nSo, in short, milk teeth are important for helping children learn to eat and speak, but they are eventually replaced by stronger, permanent teeth that are better able to do these tasks.",

    "question": "How do animals know who won a fight for dominance ? i 've always wondered how they know they have won without killing the other animal Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The victory for dominance comes when the an animal has established dominance over the other . Whenever the other animal feels powerless to continue , the dominating animal will psychologically feel being \" in charge \" . The other animal might feel \" under control \" , and thus he / she is n't dominative . How an animal \" knows \" who won the fight is how their minds make them feel . Dying is not necessary for this to happen , mere circumstances can be enough to induce these feelings . In battles of power , the classic psychological reactions are \" fight \" , \" flight \" and \" freeze \" . Flight and freeze automatically assert submission over the situation , as the animal feels that he / she is unable to fight and thus is n't dominative . Fight on the other hand implies dominance , and if both of the animals fight , whoever switches either to \" flight \" or \" freeze \" first loses dominance .

Similarly, if one animal is able to drive the other animal away or make them retreat, it may be clear that they have won the fight. \nIt's also important to note that animals don't always have to fight to determine dominance. In some cases, they may use other forms of communication, such as vocalizations or gestures, to establish their dominance without physically engaging in a fight. \nIn general, animals have developed a variety of ways to communicate with each other and establish social hierarchies, and they are often able to understand these signals and determine who has won a fight or other competition without resorting to lethal violence.",

    "answer": "A 100% satisfaction guarantee means that a business promises to make sure that their customers are completely satisfied with the products or services they have purchased. If a customer is not completely satisfied, they can contact the business and request a refund or some other form of compensation. This can be done by contacting the business through phone, email, or other means of communication, and explaining the problem or issue that led to their dissatisfaction. The business will then review the request and decide how to resolve the issue, which may include offering a refund or some other form of compensation. It's important to remember that businesses will often have specific terms and conditions that apply to their satisfaction guarantee, so it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with those before making a purchase.",

    "question": "Why are smoothbore cannons more prevalent in modern tanks when we previously hailed rifled guns as a large advancement e.g. M1 , AMX Leclrec , etc Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Rifled guns are still used in modern tanks, but smoothbore cannons have become more prevalent for a few reasons. \nOne reason is that smoothbore cannons can fire a wider variety of ammunition, including fin-stabilized projectiles and shaped charges, which can be effective against certain types of armor. Rifled guns, on the other hand, are typically limited to firing kinetic energy projectiles. \nAnother reason is that smoothbore cannons can fire projectiles at higher velocities, which can be useful for defeating modern armor. This is because the smooth bore allows the projectile to maintain a higher velocity as it travels down the barrel, whereas the rifling in a rifled gun can cause the projectile to slow down slightly. \nFinally, smoothbore cannons are generally simpler and cheaper to manufacture, which can be an important consideration when designing military equipment. \nOverall, the choice between using a rifled gun or a smoothbore cannon in a tank often comes down to the specific role that the tank is intended to play and the types of threats it is likely to encounter. Both types of guns have their own advantages and disadvantages, and both can be effective in the right circumstances.",

    "answer": "The Earth's core is a very difficult place to reach, and it's not something that humans have been able to do yet. The core is located about 3,000 kilometers (1,800 miles) below the surface of the Earth, and it's made up of mostly iron and nickel. It's extremely hot down there, with temperatures reaching up to 5,500 degrees Celsius (9,932 degrees Fahrenheit). \nTo reach the core, we would have to dig through a lot of rock and other materials, which would be very hard and time-consuming. Plus, the extreme heat and pressure at the core would make it very dangerous for humans to be there. \nSo while it might be interesting to know what's at the Earth's core, it's not something that we can easily do right now. Scientists are still learning about the Earth's core through other methods, like studying how the Earth's magnetic field works and how earthquakes and other natural disasters happen.",

    "answer": "Yes, it is possible to not have citizenship of any country. This is called being stateless. \nBeing stateless means that you do not have a nationality, or citizenship, recognized by any country. This can happen for a variety of reasons. For example, you might have been born in a country that does not recognize your parents as citizens, or you might have been stripped of your citizenship by the country you were previously a citizen of. \nBeing stateless can be a very difficult situation, because it means that you do not have the rights and protections that citizenship usually provides. For example, you might not have the right to live and work in any particular country, or to access education, healthcare, and other services. \nIf you find yourself in a situation where you are stateless, it is important to seek help from organizations that can assist you in getting your citizenship recognized by a country or in finding a solution to your situation.",

    "answer": "Generally , at cheaper restaurants , especially in America , serving sizes are way bigger than they need to be ( a human stomach is roughly the size of your fist ) . The serving sizes are increased to give the impression of value for money ; for the restaurant , the cost of the food is not much compared to labour , rent , maintenance , etc . At fancier restaurants , the experience is about the food more so than about value .

    "question": "Why is it that the more expensive a restaurant is , the less food you get ? Generally speaking ... Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "There are a few reasons why you might get less food at a more expensive restaurant: \n1. Higher quality ingredients: More expensive restaurants often use higher quality ingredients, which can be more expensive to source and prepare. As a result, the portion sizes may be smaller, but the food is generally considered to be of a higher quality. \n2. Presentation: More expensive restaurants often put more effort into the presentation of their dishes, which can include adding more garnishes or making the food look more visually appealing. This can take up more space on the plate, leaving less room for the actual food. \n3. Ambiance: More expensive restaurants often have a more upscale ambiance, which can include things like nicer decor, more attentive service, and a more relaxed atmosphere. These factors can contribute to the overall dining experience, which some people are willing to pay more for. \n4. Profit margins: Like any business, restaurants need to make a profit in order to stay open. Higher prices can help to cover the costs of running the restaurant, including things like rent, utilities, and employee salaries. By charging more for their food, restaurants are able to make a profit while still offering high-quality ingredients and a pleasant dining experience. \nOverall, the price of a meal at a restaurant is often a reflection of the quality of the ingredients, the effort that goes into the presentation of the dish, and the overall dining experience. While you might get less food at a more expensive restaurant, the food is often of a higher quality and the dining experience is generally considered to be more enjoyable.",

    "question": "can a submarine stop and hover at the same depth like a helicopter , or does it need to continue to be on the move in order not to sink like a plane , how \\ why ? edit : thank you guys;great answers :-) Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "In principle a submarine can stop and maintain depth , but they tend not to be very good at it . This is because , when stopped , they have to rely on trim tanks ( which can pump water in and out ) to adjust the buoyancy to keep the submarine at completely neutral buoyancy , as any small difference will cause the submarine to slowly drift up or down . This tends not to be a very accurate process , plus you are then susceptible to any upwards or downwards currents . So typically submarines will maintain a very slow speed ( 1 - 3 knots , if memory serves ) when they want to hold position , because that allows them to use their dive planes ( the little wings that are on the sides of the submarine ) . The dives planes can react quickly to changes in depth / buoyancy and can also help keep the submarine level .

    "question": "can a submarine stop and hover at the same depth like a helicopter , or does it need to continue to be on the move in order not to sink like a plane , how \\ why ? edit : thank you guys;great answers :-) Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Submarines can stop and hover at a certain depth in the water, just like a helicopter can hover in the air. However, unlike a helicopter, a submarine doesn't use any special equipment to stay in one place. Instead, it uses something called \"neutral buoyancy\" to hover in the water. \nBuoyancy is the force that makes objects float or sink. When an object is more buoyant, it will float, and when it is less buoyant, it will sink. A submarine can control its buoyancy by taking in or letting out water from special tanks called \"ballast tanks.\" \nWhen a submarine wants to go down, it takes in water into its ballast tanks, making it more dense and less buoyant. When it wants to go up, it lets the water out of its ballast tanks, making it less dense and more buoyant. By carefully controlling the amount of water in its ballast tanks, a submarine can hover at a certain depth in the water without sinking or rising. \nSo, to sum it up, a submarine can stop and hover in the water by using its ballast tanks to control its buoyancy.",

    "answer": "In Canada, each province has the authority to set its own tax policies, including whether or not to charge a provincial sales tax (PST). Alberta is one of the provinces that has chosen not to charge a PST. Instead, Alberta relies on other types of taxes, such as the Alberta corporate tax and the Alberta personal income tax, to fund government services. \nOther provinces, such as British Columbia and Saskatchewan, do charge a PST, which is a tax on goods and services purchased within the province. This tax is added to the price of the goods or services at the time of purchase, and the money collected from the PST is used to fund various programs and services in the province. \nSo, the main reason why Alberta does not charge a PST is because the government of Alberta has decided to fund its programs and services in a different way.",

    "question": "How is the ISS ' orbit curved ( Link attached ) ? Are they using propulsion ? URL_0 Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The International Space Station (ISS) orbits the Earth in a path that is shaped like a slightly squashed circle, or an oval. This is because the ISS is being pulled towards the Earth by the Earth's gravity, but it is also moving very fast. When an object moves very fast, it is harder for gravity to pull it down, so it follows a curved path instead of falling straight down. \nTo stay in orbit, the ISS has to keep moving at a specific speed and altitude. If it slows down or drops too low, it will fall back to Earth. If it speeds up or climbs too high, it will fly off into space. To maintain its orbit, the ISS uses thrusters, which are small engines that produce a jet of gas to push against. By firing the thrusters, the ISS can adjust its speed and direction to stay in its desired orbit. \nIn the attached image, you can see a diagram of the ISS's orbit around the Earth. The curved line shows the path that the ISS follows as it orbits the Earth. The Earth is at the center of the diagram, and the ISS is shown as a small blue dot moving around it. \nI hope this helps to explain how the ISS's orbit is curved and how it uses propulsion to stay in orbit.

    "answer": "Sure! I'd be happy to explain how headphones like the ones you've described are able to play stereo sound, have a microphone, and three buttons for volume control and pausing. \nTo play stereo sound, headphones typically have two speakers, one for the left channel and one for the right channel. These two speakers work together to create the illusion of sound coming from different directions, which gives a more immersive listening experience. \nThe microphone on the headphones allows you to talk to other people when you're using the headphones to make phone calls or use voice chat. \nThe three buttons on the headphones allow you to control the volume of the sound you're listening to, as well as pause and resume playback. These buttons are usually connected to the device that the headphones are plugged into (such as a phone or a computer) through wires that are inside the headphone cord. When you press one of the buttons, it sends a signal through the wires to the device, telling it to adjust the volume or pause the music. \nI hope that helps to explain how these headphones work!

    "answer": "Multiplication is repeated additions . So A * B means add A to itself B times . If you have -A * B , you are saying to add -A to itself B times . Because adding a negative to a negative only makes the sum more negative ( further below zero ) , you will get a negative number . If you have A * -B , you are saying to take the ~~inverse~~ opposite of A and add THAT number to itself B number of times . The ~~inverse~~ opposite of A is -A , so A * -B can be rewritten -A * B. So , if you have -A * -B , you are saying to take the ~~inverse~~ opposite of -A and add it to itself B times . Since the ~~inverse~~ opposite of -A is A , you effectively get A * B.

This means that they do not have the usual dark and light stripes, but they may still have some faint stripes visible on their fur. This can happen because the fur of an albino zebra may still have some slight variations in color due to the way the hair grows.

    "answer": "Patents expire because they are legal agreements that give the holder of the patent the right to stop other people from making, using, or selling the patented invention for a certain number of years. The reason patents have an expiration date is to encourage innovation. When a patent expires, other people can start making and using the invention without asking for permission from the person who owned the patent. This means that more people can start using and improving upon the invention, which can lead to new and better products being developed. \nThink of it like this: if you invent a new kind of toy, you might get a patent to protect your idea. This means that other people can't make toys that are exactly the same as yours without your permission. But if you only have the patent for a certain number of years, after that time other people can start making toys like yours. This helps to encourage new ideas and inventions, because people know they will eventually be able to use the ideas of others to make new and improved products.",

ATP is what powers all of the cell's functions, including movement, growth, and reproduction. \nThere are a few organisms that can survive without oxygen, such as some types of bacteria. These bacteria are called anaerobes, and they are able to use other substances, such as sulfur, to produce energy instead of oxygen.

It does this by agitating the clothes in a tub of water and then spinning the tub to remove excess water. \nA dryer, on the other hand, is designed to remove moisture from clothes after they have been washed. It does this by blowing hot air over the clothes as they tumble in a drum. The heat from the air helps to evaporate the moisture from the clothes, and the tumbling action helps to fluff them up and remove wrinkles. \nOne reason that washers and dryers are separate machines is because they require different types of energy to operate. Washing machines typically use electricity to power the agitator and spin the tub, while dryers use electricity or natural gas to generate heat. \nAnother reason is that washing and drying clothes can be time-consuming processes, and having two separate machines allows people to do them at different times or even in different locations. For example, you might wash your clothes at home and then take them to a laundromat to dry them. \nOverall, having separate washers and dryers allows people to more efficiently clean and dry their clothes, and also gives them more flexibility in how they do these tasks.",

    "question": "why do we \" hide under the covers \" when we feel endangered . Why do we feel like it makes us Safer ? I searched first , but none of the answers satisfied me . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "When we feel endangered or threatened, our natural instinct is to seek safety and protection. One way that people try to find safety is by hiding under the covers or in a small, enclosed space. This behavior is called \"seeking shelter\" and it is a way for our bodies to protect ourselves from harm. \nImagine that you are in a dark room and you hear a loud noise. Your body might automatically respond by trying to find a place to hide, like under the covers or behind a chair. This is because our brains are programmed to protect us from danger, and hiding can help us feel safer because it gives us a sense of being hidden or concealed from the thing that is threatening us. \nHiding under the covers can also be a comforting and familiar activity, especially for children. It can help us feel safe and secure, like we are back in the womb or being protected by our parents. \nSo, in short, people hide under the covers when they feel endangered because it is a natural instinct to seek safety and protection, and because it can also be a comforting and familiar activity.",

The northern part of the peninsula was occupied by the Soviet Union, while the southern part was occupied by the United States.

The government in the north was a communist government, while the government in the south was a democracy. \nThe decision to split the peninsula into two separate countries was made by the Soviet Union and the United States, rather than by the Korean people.

    "answer": "Books don't have ratings like movies, video games, and music because books are generally considered to be for a more general audience than those other forms of media. While movies, video games, and music are often created for specific age groups or audiences, books are often written for a wider range of people and are not necessarily intended for children, teenagers, or adults exclusively. \nThere have been efforts to create rating systems for books in the past, but they have not been widely adopted. One reason for this is that books are often more complex than other forms of media, and it can be difficult to assign a simple rating that accurately reflects the content of a book. Additionally, books are often read by people of all ages, and a rating system that is appropriate for one age group might not be appropriate for another. \nOverall, the lack of a rating system for books is due to the fact that books are typically considered to be for a more general audience and are not necessarily targeted at specific age groups like other forms of media.",

    "answer": "Vanilla is a type of flavoring that is made from the seed pods of a tropical climbing orchid plant called Vanilla planifolia. These seed pods are green when they are picked from the plant, but they turn black when they are dried and cured. \nThe vanilla flavoring that we use in cooking and baking is made by extracting the flavor from the cured, black seed pods. The extract is a dark brown, almost black, color. However, when we use vanilla extract in our recipes, it is usually only a small amount, and it gets mixed in with other ingredients, so it doesn't have a noticeable effect on the overall color of the finished dish. \nVanilla is often associated with white and yellow because those are the colors of many of the foods and drinks that vanilla is used in, such as vanilla ice cream, vanilla cake, and vanilla frosting. These foods are white or yellow in color, and the vanilla flavoring helps to enhance their flavor, but it doesn't change their color. \nI hope this helps to explain why vanilla is often associated with white and yellow, even though the source of the flavor, the vanilla seed pods, are black.

    "answer": "Toilet tanks are typically attached to the bowl with a rubber seal because rubber is a flexible material that can create a tight seal and is resistant to leaks. However, the base of the toilet, which sits on the floor, needs to be able to move slightly to accommodate small movements in the floor or foundation. If a rubber seal were used in this case, the toilet might be too rigid and might crack or break if the floor moves. \nWax is a soft, pliable material that can create a good seal without being too rigid. It also has some stickiness, which helps it stay in place and prevents it from sliding around. When the toilet is installed, a ring of wax is placed around the base of the toilet, and the toilet is pressed down onto the wax. This creates a tight seal between the toilet and the floor, and allows the toilet to move slightly without breaking. \nOverall, wax is used to seal the base of the toilet to the floor drain because it is flexible and sticky enough to create a good seal, while also being able to accommodate small movements in the floor.",

The title \"Dalai Lama\" means \"Ocean of Wisdom,\" and the person who holds this title is considered to be a spiritual leader and guide for Tibetan Buddhists. \nIn Tibetan Buddhism, the process of finding and recognizing the reincarnation of a high lama, such as the Dalai Lama, is called \"tulku.\" When a Dalai Lama dies, a search is undertaken to find his reincarnation, often through the use of certain rituals and divination practices. The reincarnation is then traditionally enthroned as the next Dalai Lama. \nThe current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, is the 14th person to hold this title. In 2011, he announced that he may be the last Dalai Lama, stating that the institution of the Dalai Lama may be abolished in the future.

However, these terms are not used in the same way by professionals in the field of psychology. \nA psychopath is someone who is characterized by a lack of empathy and remorse, as well as a tendency towards manipulation and a lack of concern for the well-being of others. Psychopaths may engage in criminal or unethical behavior, and they may be prone to violence. \nA sociopath is someone who exhibits similar behaviors, but the term is not used as frequently in the field of psychology. Instead, a person who exhibits these types of behaviors might be diagnosed with a personality disorder, such as antisocial personality disorder. \nHere are a couple of examples to help illustrate the difference between a psychopath and a sociopath: \nA psychopath might be someone who manipulates and lies to others in order to get what they want, without caring about the consequences of their actions on others. For example, a psychopath might lie to a friend in order to borrow money, and then never pay the friend back, without feeling any guilt or remorse.\nA sociopath might be someone who exhibits aggressive or violent behavior towards others, without feeling remorse or empathy for the harm they have caused. For example, a sociopath might get into a physical fight with someone over a minor disagreement, and not feel any remorse for the harm they have caused. \nIt's important to note that these terms are not used in a diagnostic sense by professionals in the field of psychology, and they should not be used to label or diagnose someone.

    "answer": "Boxers train not to be knocked out by doing a variety of things: \n1. Physical training: Boxers work on building strength and endurance in their muscles through weight training, cardio exercises, and sparring (practicing fighting with another boxer).

Mental training: Boxers also work on their mental toughness by training themselves to stay focused and calm under pressure. They practice techniques like visualization and deep breathing to stay composed and clear-headed, even when they're in the middle of a tough fight. \n3. Techniques to avoid getting hit: Boxers also work on techniques to avoid getting hit, such as dodging, weaving, and footwork. By learning how to move their body effectively and stay out of their opponent's range, they can reduce their chances of getting hit and being knocked out. \n4. Knowing how to take a punch: Finally, boxers learn how to take a punch and minimize the damage it causes.

    "answer": "Because they 're different alcohols made of different things . > One reason for the different effects of vodka and bourbon , Rohsenow says , could be that bourbon contains 37 times more toxic compounds than vodka does , including nasty organic molecules such as acetone , acetaldehyde , tannins and furfural .

    "question": "why diffrent alcohols effect me . I can drink vodka all night and other clear liquors and get drunk with no issue . Yet if I spend the night drinking bourbon I get a terrible hangover . Why is this ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Different types of alcohol can affect your body differently because they contain different amounts of certain chemicals that can cause different reactions in your body. Alcohol is a depressant, which means it can slow down your brain and body functions. It's also a diuretic, which means it can cause you to lose more fluids from your body through urine, leading to dehydration. \nWhen you drink alcohol, your liver has to work to break it down and remove it from your body. Different types of alcohol are broken down at different rates, and this can affect how quickly you feel the effects of alcohol and how long it takes for your body to process it. For example, vodka is a clear liquor that is typically made from grains or potatoes, and it is generally considered to have a relatively neutral taste. It is also relatively high in alcohol content, with most vodka being around 40% alcohol by volume. This means that it can affect your body more quickly and intensely than other types of alcohol. \nOn the other hand, bourbon is a type of whiskey that is made from corn and aged in oak barrels. It typically has a strong, distinct flavor and is usually around 40% alcohol by volume. While bourbon can still affect your body in similar ways to vodka, the specific chemicals and ingredients in bourbon can cause different reactions in your body and may be more likely to lead to a hangover. \nIn general, the more alcohol you drink, the more likely you are to feel the effects of alcohol and to experience a hangover. However, different types of alcohol can affect your body differently, and certain types of alcohol may be more likely to cause a hangover than others. It's also important to note that individual differences in how people respond to alcohol can also play a role in whether or not you experience a hangover.",

    "answer": "The effect you're describing is called a \"360 degree spin.\" It's a special type of video shot that allows the viewer to look around in a full circle while the video is playing. \nTo create this effect, the camera is mounted on a special rig that allows it to rotate around a fixed point. This point is often the center of the camera's lens. \nWhen the camera is rotated around this point, it captures video from all directions. The result is a video that allows the viewer to look around in a full circle by moving their device or using their mouse. \nTo create the freeze frame effect, the camera operator simply stops the camera's movement at a specific point and holds it there for a moment. When the camera starts moving again, it appears to the viewer as if the scene has \"unfrozen\" and is continuing to play. \nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

    "answer": "Having a high IQ or being smart can have some advantages, but it is not necessarily always better than having a lower IQ or being less smart. Intelligence is just one aspect of a person and does not determine their worth or value as a human being. \nBeing smart might mean that you are able to learn new things quickly and understand complex concepts easily.

These skills can be helpful in school and in certain careers. \nHowever, being smart does not guarantee success in life or make you happier. It is important to remember that everyone has different strengths and abilities, and that it is okay to not be the smartest person in every situation. \nBeing out with friends can be enjoyable regardless of your IQ or level of intelligence. It is important to be a good friend and to treat others with kindness and respect, regardless of their intelligence or other characteristics. \nIt is not helpful or kind to think of yourself as being smarter than the people around you.

    "answer": "It is possible that the National Security Agency (NSA) may have had knowledge of certain public scandals before they became public, but it is also possible that they did not. The NSA is a intelligence agency that is primarily focused on gathering and analyzing information for national security purposes. This means that the agency may collect and analyze information about a wide range of topics, including potential scandals or crimes. However, the agency is not primarily focused on investigating or prosecuting these types of incidents, and it is not their role to make this information public. \nIf the NSA did have knowledge of a public scandal before it became public, it is possible that they may have kept this information to themselves for a variety of reasons. For example, they may have wanted to keep their sources and methods for gathering this information secret, or they may have determined that releasing the information could potentially harm national security interests. \nIn general, the NSA and other intelligence agencies are not in the business of making information public unless it is necessary for their mission of protecting national security. They typically work behind the scenes and do not reveal the information they gather or the methods they use to gather it, in order to protect their sources and methods and to avoid compromising ongoing operations.",

    "answer": "Student loans are a type of financial aid that students can use to help pay for their college education. These loans are typically provided by the government, but can also be offered by banks and other private lenders. \nWhen a student takes out a student loan, they are borrowing money from the lender to pay for their tuition and other education-related expenses. The student is then responsible for repaying the loan, with interest, after they graduate or leave school. \nThe amount of student loan funding available can impact the cost of tuition at a college or university. If there is a lot of funding available, schools may be able to charge lower tuition fees because they know that students will be able to borrow money to pay for their education. On the other hand, if there is less funding available, schools may need to increase tuition to make up for the lack of funding. \nIt's important to note that student loans can have a significant impact on a student's financial situation after they graduate. It's important for students to carefully consider their options and understand the terms of any student loans they take out before committing to borrowing money.",

    "answer": "A cable company like Comcast charges for basic cable because they are providing a service to you. They are responsible for setting up and maintaining the infrastructure (e.g., cables, satellites, etc.) that allows you to access TV channels and other programming. They also negotiate with the broadcasters and content providers to secure the rights to transmit their programming to you. All of these costs are factored into the price of the service that they offer. \nUsing an antenna to access free, over-the-air TV programming is a different way of accessing TV channels. With an antenna, you are receiving the signal directly from the broadcaster, rather than through a cable or satellite service. The signal may not be as reliable, and you may not have access to as many channels as you would with a paid cable or satellite service.

    "answer": "It 's complicated because the US Senate has a lot of somewhat quirky procedural rules that let Senators manipulate the system if they understand them well enough ( or fall into traps ) . In this particular case , there 's a combination of two issues here : ( 1 ) the federal budget , and ( 2 ) Obama 's executive nominations . On ( 1 ) , the Senate had to approve a funding bill by Saturday night , otherwise the government would run out of money and have to shut down again . So the leader of the Senate Democrats , Harry Reid , and the leader of the Senate Republicans , Mitch McConnell , made a deal to vote on Friday to pass funding for enough stuff to tide the government over until next Wednesday . Then everyone would go home for the weekend , and come back on Monday and finish passing the \" full \" funding bill . HOWEVER , under Senate rules , you have to wait a certain number of hours before voting on a bill , unless EVERYONE agrees to waive the rule . Since the Friday tide - us - over bill was a new thing , Reid and McConnell needed everyone on board so that they could pass it and go home . That 's where Cruz got involved . He basically said , \" Reid , McConnell , you agreed that on Monday we can pass this symbolic thing saying Obama 's an unconstitutional tyrant Kenyan Muslim socialist , or whatever , but that 's not good enough - we have to do it NOW . \" So he and Mike Lee refused to go along with waiving the time requirement . So that meant that everyone had to stick around until late in the night Friday / early Saturday morning to finish the budget thing . And that 's where item ( 2 ) comes into it . That extra time that all the Senators were sitting around gave Harry Reid the chance to keep the ball rolling on Obama 's nominations that have been stalled . Because he was able to move 24 of the nominees to the next procedural step , that means the can get voted on earlier next week . If they HADN'T moved that step forward on Friday night / Saturday morning , they would have had to do it on Monday , which means that the next step would have come at the end of next week , instead of the beginning / middle . And if they came at the end of next week , there 's a much better chance that a lot of Senators would be gone home for Christmas , and when they come back next year the Republicans will be in charge and they probably wo n't get passed . So basically , Ted Cruz pitching a meaningless hissy fit made it a lot more likely that a bunch of Obama nominees will get confirmed . Bravo , Ted .",

    "question": "How do fiber optics work ? Why can light enter but not exit ? Are there any practical applications of this technology ? [ gif that made me wonder ] ( URL_0 ) Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Fiber optics is a technology that uses thin strands of glass or plastic called optical fibers to transmit information, such as data or voice, over long distances. These fibers are extremely thin, about the diameter of a human hair, and are made of a special type of glass or plastic that is very good at transmitting light. \nLight travels through the fiber optic cables by bouncing off the walls of the fibers. This happens because the walls of the fibers are very smooth and the light reflects off them in a way that keeps it moving forward. The light reflects off the walls so many times that it travels a very long distance without losing much energy or intensity. \nOne reason that light can enter the fiber optic cable but not exit is because the walls of the fiber are made of a material that is very good at reflecting light. This means that when the light hits the walls, it bounces off them and continues traveling through the fiber. However, the walls of the fiber are also very smooth, which makes it difficult for the light to escape. This is why the light stays inside the fiber and is able to travel such a long distance without losing much intensity. \nThere are many practical applications of fiber optic technology. For example, it is often used to transmit data over long distances, such as in the internet. It is also used in telecommunications, cable television, and medical equipment. In these and other applications, fiber optics allows for fast, reliable, and secure communication.",

    "answer": "Yes, we do reside in the Milky Way Galaxy! The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy, which means it is a type of galaxy that has a flat, disk-like shape and a central bar-shaped structure, as well as spiral arms. It is called the \"Milky Way\" because it appears as a milky band of light in the night sky when we look up. \nTo take pictures of the Milky Way, you need a few things: \n1. A camera: Any camera with manual settings will work, but a DSLR (digital single-lens reflex) camera is generally better for astrophotography because it allows you to control the exposure, focus, and other settings more easily. \n2. A lens: A wide-angle lens with a focal length of 18-35mm is generally best for capturing the Milky Way. \n3. A tripod: A tripod is essential for keeping your camera steady while taking long exposures. \n4. A clear, dark sky: The Milky Way is most visible on clear, dark nights away from light pollution (bright lights in cities can make it harder to see the stars). \nTo take a picture of the Milky Way, you will need to set your camera to manual mode and adjust the settings to let in more light (this is called a \"long exposure\"). You will also need to focus your lens on infinity (a setting that allows you to take sharp photos of distant objects). Finally, you will need to take the picture using a long exposure time (around 10-30 seconds). \nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

    "answer": "Multilevel marketing (MLM) is a business model in which a company distributes its products through a network of independent salespeople, who are also compensated for the sales of the products they personally recruit. This can create a pyramid-like structure, with the people at the top of the pyramid earning money from the sales of the people below them. \nHowever, MLM is not necessarily the same thing as a pyramid scheme. A pyramid scheme is a form of investment where each person involved recruits others to join. Money made by the new members funnels up to the higher members. No real product or service is being sold. It's simply a way for the people at the top of the pyramid to make money from the investments of those below them. \nMLM is legal as long as the company selling the products or services is legitimate and is selling real products or services. It's important to do your research and make sure that the company you're considering joining is a legitimate business and not just a pyramid scheme. If you have concerns about a particular MLM, you can check with your local consumer protection agency or the Better Business Bureau to see if there have been any complaints filed against the company.",

    "question": "What is mass ? I know that weight is the force that comes from gravity acting on mass , but what is mass all by itself ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Mass is a physical property of an object that determines it 's ability to resist acceleration . The more massive it is , the harder it is to start moving , stop moving or change its direction . Even without gravity you need a greater force to accelerate an object with a higher mass than one with a lower mass . Mass is basically determined by how much matter is in the object , ( how big and how dense it is ) though at speeds approaching light speed the mass of an object increases despite the amount of matter remaining the same . Mass , Inertia and Momentum are probably all words you 've heard of but they basically mean the same thing , their ability to resist acceleration .

    "answer": "Dogs and cats have a different immune system than humans, which makes them less susceptible to some diseases that can be transmitted through feces. However, it's important to note that even though dogs and cats may be less likely to get sick from licking their own butt, it's still not a good idea for them to do it. Licking their butt can cause them to ingest harmful bacteria and parasites, which can lead to other health problems. \nAs for humans, we can get sick from ingesting feces because it can contain harmful bacteria, viruses, and parasites that can cause serious illnesses. When feces gets into the water supply, it can contaminate the water and make people who drink the water sick. This is especially true in areas where there isn't a good system in place to treat the water and make it safe to drink. \nIt's important for humans to practice good hygiene and to make sure that our water is clean and safe to drink.

However, it's possible that early humans may have noticed that wolves were helpful to them in certain ways, such as helping to hunt for food or providing protection. They may have also simply been attracted to wolves because they found them to be interesting or friendly. \nOver time, early humans may have started to breed wolves that were particularly good at performing certain tasks, or that had desirable traits such as being friendly or obedient. They may have also provided food and shelter for the wolves in exchange for their help.

    "answer": "Radio stations and TV stations are both businesses that make money by selling advertising. The difference is that radio stations typically make their money from selling ads that are played on the radio, while TV stations make money by selling ads that are shown during commercial breaks on TV. \nTV stations also have the option of charging a subscription fee to viewers in order to watch their programming. This is usually done through a service like cable or satellite TV, which provides access to a variety of channels for a monthly fee. \nAs for why commercials are often louder than the show, it's usually because advertisers want to grab people's attention and make their ads stand out. By making their ads louder, they hope that more people will notice and remember their ads.

    "answer": "The Big Bang theory is the most widely accepted scientific theory for the origin of the universe. It suggests that about 13.8 billion years ago, the universe began as a singularity, a point of infinite density and temperature. At this moment, all the matter and energy in the universe were concentrated in a single, infinitely small and hot point. \nThen, for reasons that are not yet fully understood, this singularity underwent a tremendous expansion, causing the universe to rapidly cool and expand. As it expanded, the universe cooled, allowing for the formation of particles and eventually atoms. These atoms eventually coalesced into stars, galaxies, and everything else we see in the universe today. \nBefore the Big Bang, it is not clear what happened or if time itself had a meaning. Some theories suggest that the Big Bang was not the beginning of the universe, but rather the result of a previous contraction or collapse of a previous universe. Others propose that the Big Bang was the beginning of our universe, but that there may be other universes with their own origins and histories. \nOverall, the Big Bang theory provides a framework for understanding the evolution of the universe, but there is still much that scientists do not understand about the early universe and what may have happened before the Big Bang.",

One reason is that internet access and infrastructure in Nigeria are not as advanced as in some other countries, which can make it easier for scammers to operate without being caught. Additionally, Nigeria has a high level of unemployment and a weak economy, which can make it more difficult for people to find legitimate work and may lead some people to turn to illegal activities like scams in order to make money. \nIt's important to remember that scams can happen to anyone, regardless of where they are located.

Gamma rays are a type of high-energy light that is often produced by nuclear reactions or radioactive decay.

Radio waves, on the other hand, have much longer wavelengths and are used for things like television and radio broadcasting. \nIf we could see all of these different types of light, we might be able to see things that are invisible to us now, such as black holes or dark matter. We might also be able to see through solid objects, like walls or buildings. \nIt is difficult to create a single picture that combines all of these different wavelengths of light, since each type of light behaves differently and requires different types of instruments to detect it. However, scientists have developed technologies that can detect and measure different types of light, and they can create images or maps that show us how different types of light are distributed in the environment. These images can be combined to create a more complete picture of the world around us.",

    "question": "Why is it okay to eat some meats that are still red in the center , but not others ? Example : eating rare steak is fine , but chicken must be cooked all the way through Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "The things you need to keep in mind are : * the structure of the meat i.e. how its cells are arranged . * the living environment of the original create e.g. caught in the wild , or raised on a farm . * the types of parasites / pathogens that the creatures are likely to be exposed to . The structure of the meat is important because it determines how easily / deeply any pathogen ( e.g. salmonella , e.coli ) can penetrate into the meat . For example chicken meat is basically a sponge . This means things like salmonella can penetrate deeply into the meat , which means you must cook the meat thoroughly in order to ensure safety ( the risk is low , but high enough to warrant this precaution ) . Beef on the other hand ( whole cuts at least ) are practically bulletproof as far as meats go . This is why you can have beef tartare , or steaks with barely a sear . The risk is comparatively much lower overall , and even if there is any harmful bacteria , it is unable to penetrate deeply into the meat - allowing you to quickly sear the meat and leave the center raw without any problems . This is also why you can easily dry age beef with few problems Ground / mince beef is technically riskier , but compared to most other meats the risk is very low ( hence tartare is on the menu ) . Fish , pork , and all wild meats can contain parasites ( with varying degrees of risk ) , which means extra care must be taken before safe consumption . Bear is so risky it is never eaten raw , while venison can be cooked to a lower temperature if handled properly beforehand . Raw fish is fine because most commercial sold fish is frozen beforehand to kill off any parasites . The same is done with pork generally , but because pork meat is still more \" spongy \" like chicken rather than \" layered \" like beef - you still have to cook thoroughly to remove the risk of bacterial contamination . Pork however can be safely dry cured when raw , as long as you use salt , sodium nitrite ( to prevent botulism ) , and the right environmental conditions ( temp / humidity ) for the cure to take place safely . Hence why you have salamis and serrano / prosciutto crudo ham . Overall - the important thing to remember is that * there is a reason * these recommendations exist * . Even though generally the risk is exaggerated through public policy ( for good reason ) , the risk is still present - so healthy adults may risk it with relative safety - but pregnant women , young children , immuno - compromised people , and the elderly should never take the risk . Hope that answers everything for you .",

    "answer": "It's generally safe to eat meats that are still pink or red in the middle as long as they have been properly handled, cooked to the right temperature, and not contaminated with bacteria. This is because the bacteria that can cause food poisoning, such as salmonella and E. coli, are generally found on the surface of the meat. When meat is cooked, the heat kills the bacteria on the surface, so if the meat is cooked all the way through, it will be safe to eat. \nHowever, certain meats, such as chicken, turkey, and pork, can carry bacteria inside them, so it's important to cook them all the way through to kill any bacteria that might be present. This is especially important when cooking chicken and turkey, as these types of meat can carry a type of bacteria called campylobacter, which can cause serious illness if it is not cooked all the way through. \nIt's also important to handle raw meat safely to avoid contaminating other foods or surfaces in your kitchen. This means washing your hands and any utensils or cutting boards that come into contact with the raw meat before and after handling it. \nIn summary, it's generally safe to eat meats that are still pink or red in the middle as long as they have been properly handled and cooked to the right temperature, but it's important to cook chicken, turkey, and pork all the way through to kill any bacteria that might be present inside them.",

This can lead to pain, discomfort, and even bleeding. \nEating a lot of fiber, on the other hand, is good for your digestive health. Fiber is a type of carbohydrate that your body can't digest. It passes through your digestive system largely unchanged and helps to add bulk to your stool, making it easier to pass. This can help to prevent constipation and keep your digestive system running smoothly. \nSo, while nails do pass through your digestive system just like any other food, they are not a healthy or beneficial thing to eat. It's important to take care of your nails and keep them trimmed to avoid the temptation to bite them.",

    "answer": "There are a few reasons why world-renowned chefs might not be able to figure out the secret recipes for fast food chain items like KFC's fried chicken. \nFirst, it's important to understand that fast food chains typically keep their recipes secret in order to protect their brand and maintain a unique selling point. This means that they don't share their recipes with anyone, including world-renowned chefs. \nSecond, even if a chef were able to get their hands on the recipe, it might be difficult for them to recreate the exact taste and texture of the food. This is because fast food chains often use special cooking methods and ingredients that are not widely available to the general public. \nFinally, it's worth noting that even if a chef were able to figure out the recipe and recreate the food, it would not necessarily be considered \"world-renowned\" cuisine. Fast food is generally considered to be lower quality and less sophisticated than gourmet cuisine, and so it might not be something that a world-renowned chef would want to be known for.",

    "answer": "Legos can be expensive for a few reasons. \nFirst, Legos are made from high-quality plastic that is designed to be durable and long-lasting. This means that the material used to make Legos is more expensive than some other types of toys. \nSecond, Legos are very popular and in high demand, which can drive up the price. \nThird, some Lego sets are very large and include a lot of pieces, which can also make them more expensive. \nFinally, some Lego sets are based on popular movies or TV shows, which can also make them more expensive due to licensing fees. \nOverall, while Legos can be expensive, they are also very high-quality toys that are meant to be played with and enjoyed for a long time.",

    "question": "Why are children allowed to act in R rated movies but they ca n't watch them ? Seems like there must be some rules here that I do n't know about . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "In the United States, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rates movies based on their content, including the level of violence, sexual content, language, and other factors. An \"R\" rating means that the movie is intended for audiences aged 17 and over, and that children under 17 can only watch the movie if they are accompanied by a parent or guardian. \nThe reason for this is that R-rated movies may contain material that is not suitable for children, such as strong language, violence, or sexual themes. While children are not allowed to watch R-rated movies on their own, they are allowed to act in them because they are performing a job, and they are usually accompanied on set by a parent or guardian who can make sure that they are not exposed to inappropriate content. \nHowever, it is important to note that the rules for children acting in movies can vary depending on the country and the specific production. Some countries may have different age restrictions for actors, or may require that certain precautions be taken to protect the well-being of child actors.",

    "answer": "The numbers 11 and 12 are not considered to be part of the \"teens\" because the word \"teen\" refers to a number that is between 13 and 19. The word \"teen\" comes from the Old English word \"ten,\" which means \"ten.\" So, when we say \"teens,\" we are referring to the numbers that are one \"ten\" (10) and nine more, which are 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19. \n11 and 12 are not part of this group because they are not between 10 and 19. 11 is one more than 10, and 12 is two more than 10. They are not \"teens\" because they are not between 13 and 19. Instead, we say \"eleven\" and \"twelve\" to refer to these numbers. \nI hope this helps to clarify things!

    "answer": "There are several factors that can affect the price of gasoline. One of the main factors is the cost of crude oil, which is the primary raw material used to produce gasoline. When the price of crude oil is low, it can lead to lower gasoline prices. Another factor is supply and demand. If there is a lot of gasoline available and not as much demand for it, the price may be lower. Additionally, the cost of refining and distributing gasoline can also play a role in the price.

This can happen because the weather is colder and people are spending more time indoors, which makes it easier for the virus to spread. In addition, people's immune systems may be weaker during the winter months, which can make them more susceptible to getting the flu. \nIt's also possible that the flu virus itself is more active during certain times of the year.

    "question": "How does abortion work ? How does it work ? How is it performed ? What happens to the fetus afterwards ? Are there different kinds of procedures ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "There are two types of abortions . Medical and surgical . Medical is quite simple and can only be done between 4 - 8 weeks safely . The doctor will give you one pill to swallow in office ( this effectively kills the fetus ) and then you take home another prescription of misoprostol . It can be taken bucally ( lined along your gums and allowed to dissolve over time ) or vaginally ( inserted with a finger or tampon but must stay laying down for 2 - 4 hours so they do not exit your vagina ) . This send the uterus into contractions like when you have your period . This will be much heavier than your normal period . You will pass huge blood clots . The next day , you will have to take those same 4 pills again to ensure that your uterus has pushed everything out . Followed by a checkup in two to three weeks to make sure you got everything out . You will still test positive on a pregnancy test for 1 - 5 weeks because they hormones take their time going back to normal . So it 's important to see a Dr for follow up . The next version is surgical which is a d & c. They will give you a medicine that is used to soften and open your cervix . They will also inject novacaine or lidocaine to minimize pain . The procedure lasts no more than 2 - 5 minutes . They enter your uterus and scrape the walls and suck it out with a vacuum like machine . It is done in one sitting and can be verified that day that the abortion is complete . They only do these on 8 - 15 weeks . Unless it 's medically required . There is typically more risk associated with this form because the scraping can cut into your uterus and cause problems further along in life . Sorry on mobile phone . Hope this is simple enough . Edit : I see some people bringing up the d & e. I was really just trying to stick to what the op asked . A simple explanation of abortions . And for me , abortions are optional meaning choice . Not like when something medically goes wrong in your pregnancy and you have to terminate . I also see people saying the pill is more dangerous than the procedure . I personally believe any medical procedure or medicine in general comes with risks . And was giving my best simplified answer .",

    "question": "How does abortion work ? How does it work ? How is it performed ? What happens to the fetus afterwards ? Are there different kinds of procedures ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Abortion is a medical procedure that ends a pregnancy. There are different ways to have an abortion, and the method used can depend on how far along the pregnancy is and other factors. \nOne way to have an abortion is with medication. This can be done during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. The person seeking the abortion takes two different medications. The first one, called mifepristone, is taken at a doctor's office. This medication makes it so the pregnancy cannot continue. A few days later, the person takes a second medication called misoprostol at home. This medication causes the uterus to contract and empty, which ends the pregnancy. \nAnother way to have an abortion is with a procedure called aspiration or suction abortion. This can be done during the first 16 to 20 weeks of pregnancy. During the procedure, a healthcare provider uses special instruments to remove the pregnancy from the uterus. The provider may use local anesthesia to numb the area and prevent pain. \nThere are other types of procedures that can be used to end a pregnancy, but these are the most common. \nAfter an abortion, the pregnancy tissue (including the fetus) is usually removed from the body. In some cases, the tissue may be examined to make sure the abortion was successful and to check for any complications. \nIt's important to note that abortion is a safe and legal medical procedure. However, it's also a personal and often difficult decision that can involve a range of emotions. If you're considering an abortion, it's important to talk to a healthcare provider or a trusted adult about your options and how to get support.",

    "answer": "The purpose of this type of tactic, called a \"volley,\" was to try to kill as many enemy soldiers as possible in a short amount of time. During the Civil War, soldiers would often line up in rows, with one row firing their weapons at the enemy while the other rows reloaded their guns. When the first row had finished firing, they would drop to the ground and the next row would stand up and fire. This allowed the soldiers to keep firing without having to pause to reload their guns. The goal was to overwhelm the enemy with a constant barrage of gunfire. \nIt was a very dangerous tactic because the soldiers were often very close to the enemy when they fired, and they were also exposed to enemy fire. Many soldiers were killed or injured during volleys. Despite the risks, both Union and Confederate soldiers used this tactic during the Civil War.",

Walking across the street can be safer than running because it allows you to move at a steady pace and pay more attention to your surroundings. When you're running, you might be more focused on getting across the street quickly and might not be as aware of your surroundings. This could make it more difficult to notice oncoming traffic or other potential hazards. It's also easier for drivers to see you and predict your movements if you're walking rather than running.

    "answer": "Tattoos are typically done using a machine that punctures the skin repeatedly with a needle to inject ink into the dermis, which is the layer of skin just below the epidermis. While the process of getting a tattoo can be painful, many people choose to undergo the process without using anaesthetics because they do not want to numb the area being tattooed. \nThere are several reasons why people might choose not to use anaesthetics when getting a tattoo. One reason is that some people enjoy the experience of getting a tattoo and see it as a form of body modification or self-expression. They may feel a sense of pride or accomplishment in enduring the pain of the tattoo process. \nAnother reason is that local anaesthetics, which are medications that numb a specific area of the body, can be expensive and may not be covered by insurance. Some people may also be allergic to anaesthetics or may not want to risk the potential side effects of the medication. \nIn addition, some tattoo artists may not offer anaesthetics as an option because they believe that the pain of getting a tattoo is part of the process and may even enhance the tattoo's overall appearance. \nOverall, the decision to use anaesthetics when getting a tattoo is a personal one that depends on an individual's pain tolerance and preferences.

    "answer": "The Higgs boson, sometimes called the \"God particle,\" is a particle that was discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a large scientific experiment that smashes particles together to study what happens. The Higgs boson was named after physicist Peter Higgs, who proposed its existence in 1964. \nThe Higgs boson is important because it helps explain why other particles have mass. In the standard model of particle physics, which is a theory that explains how the basic building blocks of matter behave, the Higgs boson is associated with a field that permeates all of space. When other particles pass through this field, they acquire mass. This is why the Higgs boson is sometimes called the \"God particle,\" because it is believed to be a fundamental part of how the universe works. \nNow, as for the doomsday part: the Higgs boson is not going to cause the end of the world. It is a very small and extremely short-lived particle that is only produced in high-energy experiments like the LHC. It does not pose any danger to the Earth or to any other planet. In fact, understanding the Higgs boson and how it works can help scientists learn more about the universe and how it was created, which can ultimately lead to new discoveries and technologies that can benefit humanity. So, there's no need to worry about the Higgs boson causing doomsday!",

    "question": "why are dentists their own separate \" thing \" and not like any other specialty doctor ? Why do I have separate dental insurance ? Why are dentists totally separate from regular doctors ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Finally , my time to shine . Dentist here . Dentistry for the most part developed as a skilled trade . The field has resisted attempts to integrate into medicine throughout its history . Initially , dental training was spotty at best and it did n't take much for somebody to claim they were a dentist . For example , Paul Revere advertised his skills as a dentist in addition to his other trade as a silver smith . There were \" dentists \" in the 18th century that were self proclaimed but branched out into dentistry after receiving a medical education , but that was not the norm . In the US , beginning in the 1840 's , dentists began to lobby the state government ( in Alabama of all places ) to allow dentists to sit on the state medical board and license dentists to practice . This did n't really begin to be enforced with any regularity until the turn of the 20th century . Many dentists that I know do not think that the two professions should merge ( as in everyone goes to medical school and then make dentistry a residency program after getting your MD ) . The claim is that there 's so much specialized knowledge in Dentistry that it would be a waste of time to spend years on rotations through the other hospital wards when you could be studying advanced periodontics or removable or whatever else . My personal opinion is that many dentists resist the change because of a fear in the reworking of the payment structure into one more similar to the HMO model that dominates general medicine . Right now HMO practice is big in dentistry but there 's still plenty of PPO plans and cash paying patients that the compensation is good , and for the most part an insurance company is n't telling you how to practice . There 's also quite a bit of territorial feelings when it comes to dentistry . Dentists tend not to like it when they feel their \" turf \" is threatened . For examples of that , just see the whole dental therapist debate . Well this turned into a wall of text . So TL;DR : History , Ego , Fears of Rocking the boat , all work together to keep the two separate . EDIT : This Gold is a Christmas miracle !

    "answer": "When you delete a file from your computer, phone, or other device, the data is not immediately erased. Instead, the space that the file occupies on the storage device is marked as available for use, and the data is not actually removed until it is overwritten by new data. \nThink of it like this: Imagine you have a piece of paper with writing on it, and you want to delete the writing. You can't just make the writing disappear, but you can mark the paper as blank and ready to be used again. If you then write something new on the paper, the old writing will be covered up and effectively \"deleted.\" \nWhen you delete a file, the operating system marks the space on the storage device as available for reuse. The data is still there, but the system treats it as if it's not. If you save a new file, the system will probably use the space that the old file was occupying to store the new one. As a result, the old data will be overwritten and effectively erased it. \nThere are some cases where deleted data can be recovered, but it requires special software and is not something that most people can do on their own. In general, once a file has been overwritten, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to recover the original data.",

This is a good time to have a lucid dream because your mind is in a state of transition between wakefulness and sleep. \nRemember, it can take some time and practice to successfully have a lucid dream. Be patient and keep trying different techniques until you find what works best for you.",

    "question": "How do people justify not making police have cameras ? If both police AND criminals act less aggressive when they know they 're being filmed , why is it not law yet ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Expense and privacy concerns . If a police officer has a camera on him at all times he 's basically a walking CCTV camera and so that brings up all sorts of privacy issues . People walking by that he does n't have reasonable suspicion to stop and ask for ID could still be IDed by a facial recognition system looking at that video feed . I still lean towards requiring them , but the privacy issues should be hashed out first . Is this footage going to be public ? Available to the police ? Only available to internal affairs ? Totally secret and only opened at a judge 's order ?",

    "question": "How do people justify not making police have cameras ? If both police AND criminals act less aggressive when they know they 're being filmed , why is it not law yet ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "There are a few reasons why some people might not support the idea of requiring police officers to wear body cameras. One reason is that there may be concerns about the cost of implementing and maintaining a body camera program. Another reason is that there may be concerns about privacy, both for the police officers who are wearing the cameras and for the people they interact with. For example, there may be concerns about who has access to the footage recorded by the cameras and how it might be used. \nThere are also some logistical challenges associated with implementing a body camera program. For example, there may be questions about when the cameras should be turned on and off, and how the footage should be stored and managed. Some people might also be concerned about the impact that body cameras could have on the relationship between police officers and the communities they serve, or on the overall effectiveness of policing. \nOverall, while body cameras can be a useful tool for increasing accountability and transparency in policing, there are also valid concerns that need to be carefully considered when deciding whether or not to implement a body camera program.",

    "question": "Why is there never any campaign for plus - size MALE models ? Or conventionally unattractive models , for example ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "There are a few reasons why there may not be as much representation of plus-size male models or conventionally \"unattractive\" models in the fashion industry. \nOne reason is that the fashion industry, like many industries, tends to focus on traditionally attractive features and body types. This can be influenced by cultural standards of beauty, which tend to prioritize certain physical characteristics over others. As a result, models who fit these standards may be more likely to be hired for modeling jobs. \nAnother reason is that the fashion industry is driven by commercial considerations, and brands may believe that featuring models who do not fit traditional beauty standards could make it more difficult to sell their products. This is not to say that plus-size male models or conventionally \"unattractive\" models cannot be successful, but rather that they may face additional challenges in breaking into the industry. \nIt's important to remember that fashion is a form of self-expression, and there is no one \"right\" way to look or be. Everyone is unique and beautiful in their own way, and it's important to celebrate diversity and inclusivity in all aspects of life.",

    "question": "Why is mental health such a taboo ? Relative to physical illness Edit : mental health with reference to mental illness Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "I think it 's only a taboo in older generations who grew up with a pretty black and white understanding of mental illness . My dad was born in the 40s and went to Vietnam . He was later diagnosed with PTSD and bipolar disorder , which he thinks is all bullshit . To paraphrase him , you 're either crazy or you ai n't . You 're either a retard or you ai n't . If you read authors like Faulkner and Steinbeck who wrote around that time period before mental illness was really well - explored , you 'll notice that the mentally ill characters are similarly characterized in pretty vague , stigmatized terms . Like \" Bob was slow / dim - witted / etc . \" By contrast , a lot of the younger generations ( kids on tumblr , for example ) seem to pride themselves on diagnosis and self - diagnosis of mental illnesses as some kind of proof of individuality and having a complex mind . I knew a guy in high school who tried to convince everyone that he had aspergers because he thought that somehow made him more unique and intelligent than everyone else . You 'll notice that it only happens with the more romanticized , movie - plot sort of mental illnesses like autism and schizophrenia . Thirteen year olds do n't typically go around trying to convince people that they are mentally retarded because that is a disability which is still stigmatized to this day in the way that the whole of mental illness was perceived in my father 's time .",

    "question": "Why is mental health such a taboo ? Relative to physical illness Edit : mental health with reference to mental illness Please explain like I'm five.",
    "answer": "Mental health refers to a person's overall emotional and psychological well-being. Mental illness is a term used to describe conditions that affect a person's mood, thoughts, or behavior and make it difficult for them to function in their daily life. Mental illness is not something that a person can simply \"snap out of\" or control on their own. \nThere are many different factors that can contribute to mental health problems, such as genetics, life experiences, and brain chemistry. Mental illness is just as real and serious as physical illness, but it can sometimes be more difficult to understand because it involves a person's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. \nMental health has often been a taboo topic, which means that people might feel uncomfortable or ashamed to talk about it. This can make it harder for people with mental health problems to get the help and support they need. Some people might not believe that mental illness is a real thing, or they might not understand how it affects a person's life. \nIt's important to remember that mental health is just as important as physical health, and it's okay to talk about it. If you or someone you know is struggling with mental health issues, it's important to reach out for help. There are many resources available, including therapists, support groups, and medications, that can help people with mental illness manage their symptoms and live fulfilling lives.",

    "answer": "Cemeteries can make money in a number of ways once they have sold all of their plots. One way is through the sale of burial vaults, headstones, and other burial-related items. Many cemeteries have on-site sales offices where these items can be purchased. \nAnother way cemeteries can make money is through the maintenance and care of the cemetery grounds. This includes tasks such as mowing the grass, trimming bushes and trees, and maintaining the roads and walkways. The cemetery may charge a fee for these services, which can help to offset the cost of maintaining the grounds. \nCemeteries may also generate revenue through the rental of space for events, such as weddings or memorial services. Some cemeteries have chapels or other buildings that can be rented out for these types of events. \nFinally, cemeteries may also generate income through the sale of cremation urns and the scattering of ashes in designated areas of the cemetery. \nOverall, the key for a cemetery to continue operating is to generate enough revenue to cover its expenses. This can be done through a combination of the methods described above and possibly others as well.",
