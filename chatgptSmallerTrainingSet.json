    "human_answer": [
      "Basically there are many categories of \" Best Seller \" . Replace \" Best Seller \" by something like \" Oscars \" and every \" best seller \" book is basically an \" oscar - winning \" book . May not have won the \" Best film \" , but even if you won the best director or best script , you 're still an \" oscar - winning \" film . Same thing for best sellers . Also , IIRC the rankings change every week or something like that . Some you might not be best seller one week , but you may be the next week . I guess even if you do n't stay there for long , you still achieved the status . Hence , # 1 best seller .",
      "If you 're hearing about it , it 's because it was a very good or very well - publicized book ( or both ) , and almost every good or well - publicized book will be # 1 on the NY Times bestseller list for at least a little bit . Kindof like how almost every big or good movies are # 1 at the box office on their opening weekend .",
      "One reason is lots of catagories . However , how the NY Times calculates its best seller list is n't comprehensive , and is pretty well understood by publishers . So publishers can [ buy a few books ] ( URL_0 ) in the right bookstores and send a book to the top of the list for at least a week ."

      "There are many different best seller lists that are published by various organizations, and the New York Times is just one of them. The New York Times best seller list is a weekly list that ranks the best-selling books in the United States based on sales data from a number of different retailers. The list is published in the New York Times newspaper and is widely considered to be one of the most influential best seller lists in the book industry. \nIt's important to note that the New York Times best seller list is not the only best seller list out there, and there are many other lists that rank the top-selling books in different categories or in different countries. So it's possible that a book could be a best seller on one list but not on another. \nAdditionally, the term \"best seller\" is often used more broadly to refer to any book that is selling well, regardless of whether it is on a specific best seller list or not. So it's possible that you may hear about a book being a \"best seller\" even if it is not specifically ranked as a number one best seller on the New York Times list or any other list.",

    "question": "If salt is so bad for cars , why do we use it on the roads ? As the title states , why do we use it ? is there no other option or what ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "salt is good for not dying in car crashes and car crashes are worse for cars then salt . Some places use other things , but salt is really cheap compared to most alternatives , although sand is pretty good .",
      "In Minnesota and North Dakota , they tend to use sand , not salt . In these states , though , it is cold enough that the salt can not actually melt the snow , and so it refreezes and you end up with black ice on the roads , which is counterproductive . In other states whether there is snow but not so cold , wet asphalt is better than gritty snow for traction and so salt is favored for safety . Most people who live in states where salt is used , and by the way also in coastal cities , know that washing the car a couple times a week is critical .",
      "Used to work in the salt industry ( yes , it 's a thing ) . Salt is one of the cheapest substances on earth . As in , you 'd be getting ripped off if you paid more than $ 150 per metric ton . ( In fact , the largest component of salt 's price is actually shipping . Yes , it costs more to transport salt than it does to produce it . ) Salt does its job ( lowering the freezing point of water ) incredibly effectively and is ludicrously abundant in nature . Its crystalline structure can also be manipulated in order to have sharper edges that reduce bounce . So that allows it to stick evenly to critical surfaces such as roads . Yes , there are alternatives . Usually salt / gravel mix or sugar beet based solutions . Those have less of an environmental impact when the spring melt washes it into the drain . This is more used in places where balance of water salinity for the safety of aquatic life is important . Propylene glycol , a water displacer , is even used in some places where it 's so cold that salt wo n't work effectively . But salt is by far the cheapest , most effective solution for preventing the icing of roads . And your government wants above all cheap and effective solutions that reduce winter accidents and keep people safe . They do n't care as much about the finish on your 1994 Honda Prelude ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "Salt is used on roads to help melt ice and snow and improve traction during the winter months. When it's cold outside, water can freeze on the roads and make them very slippery, which can be dangerous for cars and people. Salt helps to melt the ice and snow by lowering the freezing point of water, which means that it can help keep the roads clear and safe to travel on. \nThere are other options for melting ice and snow on roads, such as using chemicals like calcium chloride or magnesium chloride, or using mechanical methods like plows or sand. However, salt is often the most effective and affordable option for many communities, especially when it's used in combination with other methods. \nIt's important to note that while salt can be helpful for making roads safer during the winter, it can also have negative effects on the environment and on the cars themselves. Salt can cause corrosion on metal surfaces, including cars, and it can also harm plants and animals if it washes into nearby waterways. However, despite these potential downsides, many communities continue to use salt as a way to keep roads clear and safe during the winter.",

    "question": "Why do we still have SD TV channels when HD looks like SD on an old TV ? Could n't we just have the HD version of the channels & delete the SD ones ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "The way it works is that old TV stations got a certain amount of bandwidth to replace their old analog TV stations . However , HD takes up more bandwidth then SD - so the stations can choose between 2 or 3 HD stations , or like 7 or 8 SD stations ( or a mix of both ) They can do a bunch of SD stations and make more money in advertizing by running 7 or 8 different reruns of old SD TV shows at a time In fact , those stations often got permanent rights to show an unlimited number of reruns of old syndicated shows in perpetuity . That means they do n't even have to pay anyone to air old eppisodes of _ Star Trek _ or _ Alf _ So basically it 's free money for them , based on being around for a long , long time and having their old rights get upgraded as new technology comes out .",
      "HD does n't look like anything at all on an SD TV . An old SD television ca n't even process the HD signal . We still have SD channels because there are still SD televisions out there .",
      "There are a few reasons why SD channels still exist : 1 ) SD channels typically consume much less bandwidth than HD channels , so it is possible to carry many more SD channels than HD channels over the same coaxial cable or wireless spectrum ( for antenna broadcasts ) . This point does not apply when a television service provider carries both HD and SD versions of the same channel though . 2 ) Broadcasts formatted for HDTVs ( in 16x9 aspect ratio ) will typically have important details / information cut - off if displayed on an older 4:3 television screens . The SD - specific channels are often formatted especially for older 4:3 screens so that important graphics / information / details etc . do n't get cut - off . 3 ) Not all TVs / tuners are capable of receiving HD broadcasts even though they may be capable of receiving digital SD broadcasts . 4 ) With respect to cable TV , some cable companies still carry analog SD channels which can be received by older television sets without the need of a digital - to - analog adapter . If everything was switched to digital / HD , older televisions would need to be outfitted with a special adapter in order to receive service ( which is already the case in some areas ) . 5 ) A few televisions stations ( typically local / low - budget stations ) are still using old cameras , video processing and transmission equipment from the 90s or early 2000s and have n't yet invested in upgrading their equipment to support HD broadcasts ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "There are a few reasons why we still have SD (standard definition) TV channels: \n1. Some people still use older TVs that are not compatible with HD (high definition) signals. These TVs can only display SD channels, so if we only had HD channels, those people wouldn't be able to watch TV. \n2. HD channels take up more bandwidth than SD channels, so it's not possible to have as many HD channels as we have SD channels. This means that if we only had HD channels, some channels might not be available. \n3. HD channels also require more expensive equipment to produce, so some TV stations might not be able to afford to upgrade to HD. \nOverall, it's important to have both SD and HD channels so that everyone can watch TV, regardless of what kind of TV they have or how much money they have.",

      "It is generally not acceptable or ethical to advocate for or condone the assassination of any individual, regardless of their actions or beliefs. There are also practical considerations at play in this situation. \nFirst and foremost, it is important to remember that assassination is a violent and extreme act that can have serious consequences, both for the person being targeted and for those around them. It can also lead to further conflict and instability in the region. \nAdditionally, the North Korean government is known for being highly secretive and heavily guarded, making it difficult for outsiders to carry out such an action. There may also be legal and diplomatic implications for any country or individual that attempts to assassinate the leader of another sovereign state. \nIt is important to seek peaceful and diplomatic solutions to conflicts and differences, rather than resorting to violence and assassination.",

      "This is a frequent phenomenon with technology : something is considered very hard or even impossible for a long , long time , and then one day , somebody figures it out . That opens a whole FLOODGATE of discovery leading to discovery , and the technology leaps forward quickly . Eventually , those chains of discovery start to play out , and the rate of advancement slows down , and may even come to a halt , perhaps starting up again years later when somebody discovers something new . We saw the same phenomenon with the building of the first transistor in 1947 . The * theory * of transistors had actually been known since the early 20th century , but nobody had figured out a way to actually build one . That led to an explosion in electronics , and when somebody figured out how to put a shitload of teensy transistors on a silicon wafer , the explosion exploded .",

      "After the Wright Brothers made the first powered flight in 1903, people all around the world became interested in building and flying airplanes. Many people started working on designing and building airplanes, and as a result, airplane technology began to advance quickly. \nOne reason for this rapid advancement was the fact that airplanes were very useful for a number of different purposes. For example, airplanes were used for transportation, for carrying mail, for crop dusting, and for military purposes. This meant that there was a lot of demand for airplanes, which in turn encouraged more people to work on developing and improving airplane technology. \nDuring World War I, airplanes became even more important because they were used for fighting in the war. This led to even more rapid development of airplane technology as people tried to build airplanes that were faster, more maneuverable, and more durable. \nSo, in short, the reason that airplane technology was able to advance so quickly was because there was a lot of interest in airplanes and a lot of people working on developing and improving them. This was especially true during World War I, when the need for effective military airplanes was particularly pressing.",

    "generated_answer": [
      "The color of your eyes is determined by the amount and type of pigments in your iris, which is the colored part of your eye, and by the way that the iris scatters light. The iris contains two types of pigment: one called melanin, which gives your skin, hair, and eyes their color, and another called lipochrome, which is a yellowish pigment. The combination of these pigments, along with the structure of the iris, determines the color of your eyes. \nThere are many different shades of eye color, ranging from dark brown to light blue, and the most common eye colors are brown, blue, and green. The color of your eyes is determined by your genes, which are the instructions that you inherit from your parents that tell your body how to grow and function. \nThere is no scientific evidence to suggest that the color of your eyes has any special meaning or significance. However, many people believe that the color of your eyes can reveal certain things about your personality or your health, but these beliefs are not supported by scientific evidence. \nIn short, the color of your eyes is simply a result of the combination of pigments and the way that light is scattered by your iris, and it has no special meaning or significance.",

    "generated_answer": [
      "There are a few different factors that can contribute to the trend of throwing away products instead of fixing them. One factor is the quality of the products themselves. Some products are designed in a way that makes them difficult or impossible to repair. For example, if a product is made with very cheap materials or is put together in a way that makes it hard to access the parts that need to be repaired, it may be easier or cheaper to just throw it away and buy a new one rather than try to fix it. \nAnother factor is cultural in origin. In some societies, it is more common or acceptable to throw away things that are broken or no longer wanted, rather than trying to repair them or give them to someone else who might be able to use them. This can be influenced by things like the availability of cheap, new products and the convenience of being able to just buy a new item instead of trying to fix the old one. \nFinally, in some cases, the cost of repairing a product might be more expensive than buying a new one. This can happen if the product is very old or if the parts needed to fix it are hard to find or very expensive.

    "question": "magic the gathering What is it . how popular is it . who plays it . The culture behind it .. etc . etc I have been hearing more and more about it , and after last nights South Park episode I became curious what it is .. Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "EDIT , Nov 21 : By popular demand , now includes Midrange decks and Limited formats . Also , a new section on where players get their cards . Magic : The Gathering is a collectable card game . It can be played in several different formats , but in the most common , two players create decks out of the cards they own and play against each other . Generally , the cards in a deck are either lands or spells . Lands provide the energy needed to cast spells , and spells usually do one of the following : - Summon a creature that can fight for you or an artifact that you can use . ( * * Creatures * * and * * Artifacts * * ) - Create a lasting effect that affects the game as a whole or one or more cards in play . ( * * Enchantments * * ) - Create an instantaneous effect that affects one or more cards in play or an effect that lasts a single turn . ( * * Sorceries * * and * * Instants * * ) - Summon a sort of \" teammate \" that has its own abilities . ( * * Planeswalkers * * ) The primary goal is to run your opponent out of life points by attacking him with creatures or damaging him directly with spells . There are other ways to win , such as running your opponent out of cards in his deck . The gameplay is complex . The players take turns , but many types of spells can be cast on an opponent 's turn , or in response to a spell that they are trying to cast . A critical play by one player may be countered by the other , and that counter itself countered by the first . There are many thousands of cards out there , and you are not expected to know about them all . The Comprehensive Rules ( * not * including the text of cards ) are nearly two hundred pages , although a lot of that consists of old mechanics that are rarely used or highly - specified details that are rarely relevant . The learning curve is pretty steep , but a few games suffice to learn the basic rules . The complexity is more similar to Dungeons and Dragons than to most card games . A key feature of M : tG is the concept of * * color * * . There are five colors : Red , Green , White , Blue , Black . Each is \" allied \" to two others and \" opposed \" to the two others . Most spells require mana of a certain color to cast , which is produced by different types of land cards . Each color has distinct strengths and weaknesses \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for example , blue has the best counterspells , but it 's not very good at simply hitting things . A given deck will usually use from one to three colors of card , although in some situations decks with four or five colors can work . In addition , it is often considered that there are three general archetypes of deck ( with a * lot * of variation within each category ) : - * * Aggro * * decks focus on dealing damage ASAP to win ASAP . They usually have cheap creatures ( \" weenies \" ) that can be used right away and \" buff\"-type spells to eke out a few more points of damage . They usually win fast or not at all , because they often ca n't stand up to the more powerful creatures and spells that are played later in the game . - * * Control * * decks focus on preventing the opponent from acting until the player is ready to win with powerful spells or abilities . They run a lot of counterspells , destruction spells , and things that make action more expensive for the opponent , along with a few creatures strong on defense and disruption . They usually win by using cheap defenses against expensive attacks until they are ready to overwhelm the opponent with their accumulated strength , and lose if they just ca n't stay ahead of the enemy 's attacks . - * * Combo * * decks rely on a few combinations of cards that can lead to a near - instant victory . There * are * infinite combos in M : tG , but they 're designed to be difficult or resource - intensive to pull off . A combo deck will usually run ( in addition to the all - important combo pieces ) \" tutor \" cards that let them search their deck , protection cards to guard the combo pieces , and just enough stall cards to prevent a quick defeat . A combo deck wins when it gets its combo in place before losing , and loses if it ca n't get the combo out in time or ca n't protect it long enough to use it . - * * Midrange * * decks are a common intermediate archetype between Aggro and Control . Midrange tries to beat down the opponent with damage from powerful creatures ( colloquially , \" fatties \" ) rather than with cheap ones ( \" weenies \" ) . These decks have to run enough control to stay alive until the big hitters come out . They win when they get the hitters out early enough to do lethal damage , and lose when they ca n't get the big guys out at all ( being out - controlled ) or when they just take too much of a beating too early ( being out - aggro'd ) . --- Many different kinds of people play M : tG. There are professional players who win large sums at tournaments , groups of friends who play casually on the weekends , and everything in between . If you 're playing competitively , it can be absurdly expensive , as you can not compromise on getting the perfect cards for your deck , but if you and your opponents are playing casually , it 's a lot cheaper . The most common formats are as follows . Two - player games are the norm for tournaments , but casual matches are often multiplayer . * * Constructed * * formats call for pre - constructed decks built from each player 's personal collection : - * * Standard * * : Decks are made of cards printed in about the last 18 months . - * * Modern * * : Decks are made of cards printed since about 2003 ( minus a ban list ) . - * * Legacy * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ) . - * * Vintage * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a * very small * ban list ) . - * * Commander * * ( or \" EDH \" ): Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ) , but limited to one of each card . One creature card is designated as your \" commander \" and is nearly always available for summoning . A popular multiplayer format . * * Limited * * formats feature decks made on the spot from a limited pool of cards : - * * Sealed * * : Each player opens several randomized booster packs and makes a deck from the contents . - * * Draft * * : A group of players open many packs and use a system to pick their cards from the contents , then build a deck from what they have . These formats cost money each time to play , because you need to buy booster packs . However , you can play them without having any of your own cards beforehand . Limited play can be a good way to pick up more cards . A relatively new casual format is * * Cube * * , in which you and your group put together a large pile of cards beforehand and use them in place of booster packs . This eliminates the recurring expense , although you need to have enough cards beforehand . There are others formats , including Conspiracy , Planechase , Pauper ( use no rare cards ) . Two - Headed Giant ( play with a partner ) , and many more . Formats that allow older cards tend to be more expensive , because the cards have been out of print for a long time . Commander is a bit cheaper than other formats that allow old cards , because you only can have one of each card ( other formats usually allow up to four of each card ) . I play Commander with my D & D group . None of us puts that much money into it , and we try to keep it more fun than competitive . Some of the players also play in local mini - tournaments on Friday nights ( \" Friday Night Magic \" ) , usually breaking about even . --- So , where does one get cards ? Most cards come from randomized booster packs with 15 cards each . Cards from a given set are designated either common , uncommon , rare , or \" mythic rare \" . You can buy booster packs for around $ 3.50 USD from retailers , or you can buy them as part of a limited tournament . There are also pre - made decks that you can buy directly from Wizards of the Coast . Each one has a theme and cards intended to work together . You wo n't win any tournaments with a pre - made deck , but it can be a good starting point . In addition , there are a couple of products intended for beginners , such as the \" Deck - builder 's toolkit \" with a semi - randomized selection of cards and a big stack of common lands . ( Common lands are dirt cheap , but it would take quite a few booster packs to get enough to build a deck . ) Most M : tG players trade cards with their friends or at events to get the specific cards they need . In addition , there is a thriving market of single cards at game stores and online . Some very , very old cards are very , very rare and expensive . A single [ Black Lotus ] ( URL_0 ) can cost many thousands of dollars . But these cards are not legal in most formats , and most players will never have seen one in person . When playing casually , your group may allow the use of \" proxy \" cards to substitute for the pricey ones . Myself , I 've only been playing for a year or so , and I do n't actually own my own cards ! ( My friends have a ton of extra decks to lend out . ) I 'm planning to build my own Commander deck soon , and I 'll be starting from a pre - made deck from Wizards and supplementing it primarily with trades with friends and singles from the internet .",
      "Magic was invented , I want to say around 1994 , and was the first playable trading card game of its kind . Its format inspired more mainstream games , like Pokemon and Yugioh . I personally have known players as young as 8 or 9 , and as old as people in their 30 's and 40 's . Basically , the premise is that you 're a wizard fighting other wizards using magic spells . These spells are powered by a type of energy called mana , which is typically drawn from land . These spells can be used to summon creatures to fight for you , to help you and your creatures , or to harm your opponent and his creatures . Each player starts with 20 life points , and typically loses when they are reduced to 0 life points . There are five colors of mana , which represent the fundamental themes of the game . White represents order and justice , green represents nature and strength , red represents war and chaos , black represents death and self destruction , blue represents illusion and deception .",

If you look at the first set , you have your initial creatures of each color as an Angel ( W ) , Dragon ( R ) , Wurm ( G ) , Djinn ( U ) and Vampire ( B ) . The mana sources were played once a turn , and how you used it mattered . You could use your one mana to play a creature , or allocate those resources towards something else . You could destroy someone 's ability to produce resources . You can avoid creatures ( monsters ) all together . As the game progressed , it branched out greatly from basic D & D. Now we have entire sets of cards dedicated to a single mythos . We had 2013 as a Greek mythology themed sets , complete with gods interacting with mortals , two years before that we had a whole set of gothic horror complete with werewolves , giests and families of elitist vampires . The game has thousands of cards , some extremely valuable , some not , but it all started to see if we could attach some modicum of economics to D & D."

    "human_answer": [
      "Like viruses , they are ( groups of ) molecules that reproduce without metabolism . Unlike any other self - replicating system , prions are proteins that have a unique structure . One part of how a protein functions is the amino acid sequence that makes up the primary structure , but the other part is how the proteins folds , either by itself or with the help of other folder - helper proteins . Prions have the same amino acid sequence as their properly folded brethren , but they are folded differently , and they make a chain reaction by folding their brethren to be like them . Cruetzfeld - Jakob disease in humans , Mad Cow disease in cows , and chronic wasting disease in deer , are all prion diseases that affect neuronal proteins .",
      "A prion is a special kind of deformed protein . When it comes in contact with normal proteins , it causes them to deform in the same way . So not only are the proteins deformed will no longer to their jobs , they spread the deformity to other proteins .",

    "generated_answer": [
      "Prions are tiny particles that can cause serious and often fatal diseases in people and animals. They are made up of proteins, which are important building blocks in the body. Normally, proteins have a specific shape that helps them do their job. But prions are abnormal proteins that have a different shape, and they can cause other proteins around them to change shape too. When this happens, it can cause problems in the body because the proteins are not able to work properly. \nPrions are not viruses, and they do not contain any genetic material (like DNA or RNA) like viruses do. Instead, they are thought to be able to change the shape of proteins by acting as a kind of template for other proteins to copy. \nPrion diseases can be very serious and are often fatal. Some examples of prion diseases include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, also known as \"mad cow disease\") in cows. These diseases can be transmitted through contaminated food or medical equipment, but they can also occur spontaneously in some people. \nThere is currently no cure for prion diseases, and they can be difficult to diagnose. Researchers are working to better understand how prions cause disease and to find ways to prevent and treat these conditions.",

These paper towels are still trying to be good but poor genes have them already behind a better crafted towel . Now let 's pretend we have two hammocks with one being designed using the shitty paper towel and one using the really strong and absorbent towel . If you consider each one of life 's problems and also just poor genes as a marble and you were to drop a marble into the hammocks they would eventually fall thru and you would be screwed .

There are some diseases like Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Fibromyalgia which have a strong statistical relationship with mental health disorders such as depression , but we do n't understand the root cause enough to say for sure how they are related .",
      "The ' brain ' and body in general is always trying to equalize a ' chemical normal ' which is defined in real - time by your static DNA & dynamic RNA signatures .

Minor variations can also be attributed to your ' waking period ' memory , but as implied , these are only relevant to situations learned in the immediate ' awake ' period since last REM sleep . That key comparison will return a ' positive ' branch if the historical experience has a tendency toward restoring ' normal ' metabolic equilibrium . A ' negative ' if the experience history is deviating from your ' normal ' ... --- or an undefined state - which generates a new ' experience node ' at the junction of those unresolved situations - ready for a new outcome to be acquired and learned into experience . Only the two ( + /- ) outcomes are allowed in order to eliminate fence - sitting deadlock of a situation .

Where you go after that - depends on the forward branching of subsequent situations , experiences and nodes . Think of it like a huge ' tree ' of life experience . You are born with no experience at ' ground level ' and grow outward toward the sky .

    "human_answer": [
      "Most of the time , any location wo nt do . They want a specific look , so they build a set to fit that look . Or there s nothing like it nearby , and it 's cheaper than paying everyone to live somewhere else for the length of the shoot . Also , many public places simply ca n't be close off that long . If you 're filming a movie over the course of a year , you might be able to shut down an area for a few days of shooting , but if you need that space often you 're not going to be able to shut down a park or roads every few days . Also , if you 're filming in a public area it 's hard to stop the public from wandering in or watching from as close as possible . also , they can build the set without certain walls or in certain ways so camera angles that are n't possible in real places you can suddenly do . And if you have to destroy something ..... or have something loud and noisy or distracting ...",
      "Lighting and camera placements .

In a real room , you are very constrained on where you can place the camera and where the actors can stand .

    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "There are a few reasons why movie companies might choose to build sets rather than film on location: \n1. Control: Building a set allows the filmmakers to have complete control over the look and feel of the environment in which they are shooting. This can be especially important if the story takes place in a fantastical or fictional world, or if the filmmakers want to create a specific mood or atmosphere. \n2. Cost: While it may seem like it would be cheaper to film on location, this is not always the case. Renting a location can be expensive, especially if the filmmakers need to use it for an extended period of time. Additionally, the filmmakers may need to pay to use certain locations, or they may have to pay to have the location altered in some way to suit their needs. \n3. Logistics: Filming on location can also be logistically challenging. The filmmakers may need to deal with crowds, noise, and other distractions, which can make it difficult to get the shots they need. Additionally, the filmmakers may not have access to all of the resources they need on location, such as electricity, water, or special equipment. \n4. Safety: Finally, building a set can be safer for the cast and crew. Filming on location can involve dealing with hazards such as traffic, unstable terrain, or inclement weather. By building a set, the filmmakers can create a controlled environment where these hazards are minimized. \nOverall, building sets can be more expensive upfront, but it can also be more cost-effective in the long run, as it allows the filmmakers to have greater control over their shooting environment and reduce the risk of delays or unexpected costs.",

    "question": "What is a \" Tor exit node \" or \" Tor node \" What is a \" Tor exit node \" or \" Tor node \" ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "I 'm going to go off the assumption that you do n't know what tor is , if you do then feel free to skip the next paragraph . The entire idea behind tor is that by bouncing your information through different relay points , each of which is secured and the data transfers between them are encrypted , thus making your communications much harder to trace back to you . If I turn on my computer and use a regular browser , lets say Firefox , my computer requests that a specific bit of information from , lets say , reddit . My request is sent from my computer , to my ISP 's servers , to the servers of the website and then takes the little bit of information , lets say a specific webpage , and then does that same process in reverse . Taking the information from the servers of the website to the ISP 's servers and then back to my computer . Tor complicates this process by , rather then doing a straight line of data from computer to ISP to site , first encrypting all the communication and then secondly bouncing that signal / request for data around before submitting the request for information . This has the effect of making you appear like your in another place and posses a different IP address then you actually do . Simply put , a Tor node is one of the small parts of the jump that obfuscates your physical location and IP address by bouncing your information . An exit node is a tor node that serves as the ' exit ' point from the tor network and sends the actual request for information from the site . Hopefully that clears this up , if you have anymore questions just ask . :)",
      "Tor is an encryption system that bounces your data between dozens of computers around the world , each computer unravelling one layer of encryption that tells it who to send it to next , to make it tough to trace . Each one of those computers is a node , and the one at the end of the chain - where your data hits the rest of the internet - is an exit node .",
      "TOR is a routing system and stands for ' The Onion Router ' because it works in layers , just like an ogre or an onion . A TOR node is a node that participates in a TOR network , i.e. a server somewhere on the planet . The exit node is just the last node in a given configuration , i.e. the node just before the server you want to reach . TOR is used to hide the identity of the user . TOR works like this : you take your message and encrypt it with multiple encryption algorithms - one for every TOR node you want to route through . Thus layers . You do it in the following order : the most outer layer is encrypted so the the very first TOR node and only the very first TOR node can decipher it . The second outer layer is encrypted so the the second TOR route can decipher it and so on , and the last layer is encrypted so that the exit node can decipher it . This means that if you send your message to the first node he gets rid of the most outer layer . The message is still scrambled and unreadable because there are still as many encryption layers as there are TOR routes left . Now , provided you use end - to - end encryption on top of using TOR this system becomes pretty good at hiding your identity because for every single node in the configuration the node only knows where any given message came from and where it has to go . It does n't know if it 's the first one that got the message or the last one and it does n't know what 's written in it . So , unless every single TOR node in a configuration is corrupted you can be sure that your identity is hidden ."

      "It's important to note that not all Republicans are against giving the LGBT community equality. In fact, many Republicans support equal rights for the LGBT community. However, there are some conservatives who may not support equal rights for the LGBT community for a variety of reasons. \nOne reason may be due to their religious beliefs. Some conservatives may believe that being gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender goes against their interpretation of certain religious texts, and therefore they may oppose laws that would give these groups equal rights. \nAnother reason may be due to a belief in traditional gender roles and sexual orientations. Some conservatives may believe that there are only two genders (male and female) and that people should only be attracted to members of the opposite sex. They may therefore oppose laws that would give equal rights to those who do not fit into these traditional gender roles or sexual orientations. \nIt's also possible that some conservatives may simply not understand or agree with the experiences and perspectives of the LGBT community, and therefore may not support equal rights for them. \nOverall, it's important to remember that there are many different viewpoints on this issue, and that not everyone may agree on the best way to ensure equal rights for all people, including those in the LGBT community.",

    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "The sensation of falling in dreams is actually a very common experience and can be caused by a variety of factors. One reason people may experience this sensation is due to changes in their body position while they are sleeping. When you are lying down, your body is in a state of relative stillness. However, if you move or shift positions while you are sleeping, your body may perceive this movement as falling. This can trigger a reflex that causes you to feel like you are falling or to experience a sensation of vertigo. \nAnother reason people may experience the sensation of falling in their dreams is due to changes in their brain activity while they are sleeping. During the dreaming stage of sleep, known as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the brain is more active and may produce vivid and sometimes strange or surreal dreams. In some cases, the sensation of falling may be part of the dream content and may be related to the dreamer's feelings or emotions. \nFinally, the sensation of falling in dreams may be related to the way our brains process and interpret sensory information while we are asleep. During sleep, our brains are still receiving and processing sensory information from our surroundings, even though we are not consciously aware of it. This sensory information may be incorporated into our dreams and may contribute to the vividness and realism of the dream experience. \nOverall, the sensation of falling in dreams is a normal and common experience that is caused by a combination of factors related to body position, brain activity, and sensory processing during sleep.",

      "holding the knife the traditional way gives good reach and finesse for fighting and holding the opponent at a distance . It is often a weaker grip , easier to disarm and harder to make powerful blows with . The goal of an assassin is almost always contrary to that goal .

    "generated_answer": [
      "Holding a knife with the blade facing down is generally a more stable and secure grip, especially when the knife is being used for thrusting or stabbing motions. When the blade is facing up, it is more likely to slip out of the hand or be deflected by an opponent. In addition, holding a knife with the blade facing down allows the user to have better control over the blade and to apply more force when making a strike. \nImagine that you are holding an apple in your hand and you want to cut it in half with a knife. If you hold the knife with the blade facing up, it might be more difficult to control the blade and keep it from slipping as you make the cut. On the other hand, if you hold the knife with the blade facing down, it will be easier to keep the blade steady and apply more force as you cut through the apple. \nIn movies and games, assassins and other characters who use knives may hold them with the blade facing down for these same reasons.

    "generated_answer": [
      "There are a few reasons why a carton of beer might cost less than four wine glasses: \n1. Quantity: A carton of beer contains 24 bottles, while you are only buying four wine glasses. When you buy in larger quantities, the cost per unit (in this case, per bottle or per glass) is often lower. \n2. Materials: Wine glasses are typically made from materials like glass or crystal, which can be more expensive to produce than the materials used to make beer bottles (such as glass or aluminum). \n3. Brand: The specific brand of wine glasses and beer that you are comparing might also have an impact on the price. Some brands are known for using higher-quality materials or have a more premium image, which can result in higher prices. \n4. Production and distribution costs: The process of producing and distributing wine and beer also involves different costs. For example, the process of making wine involves fermenting grapes and aging the finished product, which can be more time-consuming and costly than the process of brewing beer. Additionally, wine is often shipped and stored at specific temperatures to preserve quality, which can also add to the overall cost. \nOverall, the price of a product is determined by a combination of factors, including the materials used, the brand, the quantity, and the costs involved in production and distribution.",

For example, Crest is a brand of toothpaste that is popular in the United States, and Blend-a-Med is a brand of toothpaste that is popular in Europe. Both brands make toothpaste, but they have different names because they are marketed to people who speak different languages. \nAnother reason why products might have different names in different countries is because different countries have different regulations about what can be sold and how it can be marketed.

    "human_answer": [
      "They do n't . Criminal profiling is a pretty controversial topic among professionals . For every criminal profile that is right there is usually one that is wrong . The efficacy of criminal profiling is hotly debated . It does n't help that shows misrepresent what it is and how well is works .",
      "In certain situations , it may be possible to infer some psychological traits or characteristics of the criminal through profiling with a reasonable degree of accuracy based on factors such as who the targeted victim(s ) were , where the crime took place , what evidence was left at the crime scene , whether the crime scene was left neat / clean or messy / dirty , etc . The degree to which these profiles are accurate tends to increase with the number of data - points ( e.g. crime scenes ) that the profiler has to work with ( i.e. that are believed to be linked to the same offender ) . Profiling specific details ( e.g. a particular car model ) can not be done with any sort of accuracy unless the profiler has additional information ( e.g. physical evidence or eye - witness accounts ) which leads him / her to make such a conclusion . It is possible , however , that certain evidence may lead the profiler to suspect the criminal drives a certain type of vehicle . For example , evidence may suggest that the crime was politically motivated and the offender is an environmental protection activist . It may therefore be predicted that the offender drives an environmentally friendly electric / hybrid car . If , on the other hand , the criminal is suspected of being a hunter and weapons enthusiast , it may be predicted that he drives a utility truck of some sort which has lots of storage space . Criminal Profiling is still a hotly debated topic in Forensic Psychology because - although many profiles do turn out to be quite accurate - there are many criminals who are eventually caught and do n't end - up matching the predicted profile . The forensic utility of profiling is still questioned and it 's important for people to realize that these profiles are merely educated guesses and law enforcement should not eliminate or ignore suspects who do n't fit the suspected profile . Source : Degree in Psychology & Criminology .",
      "Most of the traditional \" real - life \" FBI profiles are more demographic - based than psychology - based . That is , they figured out that most rapists and other predatory sexual criminals started at around X age , grew more criminally sophisticated ( and often more violent ) as they committed more crimes , had certain types of experiences and behaviors in their background ( abuse , neglect , voyeuristic behavior , violence toward animals ) , etc . Based on that data they 're able to predict certain things about an offender with a certain degree of accuracy : age ( or at least experience level ) , race -- since most sexual criminals tend to victimize those of their own race -- background / living situation , and so on . In addition , there are certain other things that are more specific . For instance , if a murder is carried out \" military style \" , then they might surmise that the killer has military or law enforcement experience . If the crime scene is haphazard or disorganized , they may surmise that the killer is less experienced and probably younger , while a \" neater \" crime scene indicates someone who 's been at it for a while . The real misconception about profiling in terms of how it 's portrayed in popular culture , I think , is that it 's often shown as a more intuitive process , which only certain hyper - imaginative / hyper - empathetic individuals are able to carry out . This is where characters like Will Graham from the show \" Hannibal \" or Frank Black from \" Millennium \" come in , who are portrayed as having an almost quasi-(if not explicitly)psychic ability to \" see through the killer 's eyes \" or what have you ."

      "Forensic psychologists use a variety of techniques to create criminal profiles, but they do not typically include very specific details like the make, model, and color of a suspect's car or their hobbies. Instead, they focus on analyzing the characteristics of the crime and the behavior of the perpetrator to create a profile of the person who is most likely to have committed the crime. \nTo create a criminal profile, forensic psychologists may consider factors such as the type of crime that was committed, the age and gender of the victim, and any other details about the crime scene that may be relevant. They may also review police reports and interviews with witnesses to gather additional information about the crime. \nOnce they have gathered this information, forensic psychologists use their training in psychology and criminal behavior to make educated guesses about the characteristics of the person who committed the crime. For example, they may consider whether the crime was committed in a very organized or a very disorganized manner, which can provide clues about the personality and level of intelligence of the perpetrator. \nOverall, the goal of creating a criminal profile is to help law enforcement narrow down their list of suspects and ultimately identify and catch the person who committed the crime.",

The company may have a strong financial foundation: AMD may have a large cash reserve or access to credit that allows it to continue operating despite experiencing losses. \n2. The company may be investing in growth: Sometimes a company will report losses because it is investing in new products, technologies, or markets that it expects will generate profits in the future. This can be seen as a long-term investment in the company's growth and success. \n3. The company may be facing short-term challenges: A company might experience losses due to temporary issues, such as increased competition, changes in market conditions, or supply chain disruptions. These challenges can be addressed over time, and the company may return to profitability once they are resolved. \nIt's also worth noting that not all types of losses are created equal. For example, some losses may be due to one-time expenses, such as legal settlements or restructuring costs, while others may be ongoing operational expenses.

      "A union is essentially a representative that sits between you and your employer when it comes to matters such as hiring ( workplace agreements and wages ) , termination ( fair dismissal , severance ) , strikes and so on . For workers unions are usually a good thing , because the union represents a large number of people in an industry they 're in a good position to negotiate better wages and working conditions than any individual would be able to get . The union will also represent you in workplace disputes , and can sometimes provide legal representation . Unions do have some downsides . For example if there are non - unioned workers in an industry it effectively weakens the union 's position ( why would an employer agree to the union 's demands when they can just hire non - union people instead ) . Therefore in some industries there is a lot of pressure on workers to join unions . If you look around you 'll find stories of strong - arm tactics or even open hostility . Employers also find unions difficult to work with . An employer needs to consider the financial situation of their company when considering things like wages , the union does n't have the same concern and so could make demands greater than the employer can cover , if the employer does n't meet the demands or negotiate them down then they risk their staff going on strike . The pro - union counterargument is that without unions the employers will have minimal pressure to actually raise wages , and that factors such as workplace favouritism could end up with two employees doing the same work for different amounts of pay , therefore it is better to have the employer and the union negotiate the wage for everyone ."

I 'm not sure of the correlation between breastfeeding ( or milk production ) and cancer growth , but * all * cells can mutate in this way .

      "It is not true that glands in the breast that have produced milk cannot get cancer. Any part of the body, including the breasts, can potentially develop cancer. \nThe breast is made up of various types of cells, including glandular cells, which produce milk, and connective tissue cells. Cancer can develop in either of these types of cells, as well as in other cells in the breast. The most common type of breast cancer is ductal carcinoma, which starts in the cells lining the milk ducts. \nIt is important for all individuals to be aware of the signs and symptoms of breast cancer and to practice regular self-exams and seek medical care if they notice any changes in their breasts. It is also important to get regular mammograms and other screenings, as recommended by a healthcare provider, in order to detect breast cancer early and increase the chances of successful treatment.",

    "question": "How vulnerable are TOR users . I 'm not literally 5 , and I have a basic knowledge of computers , but I simply ca n't understand [ this ] ( URL_0 ) . How can an attacker deanonymize a victim using this procedure ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "The news article you posted does n't do a great deal of explaining , but the [ published paper ] ( URL_0 ;) is quite useful . Particularly , the attack summarised through the following steps : 1 ) Client downloads a file from the server that colludes with the adversary . 2 ) While the download progresses , the server injects a repeating traffic pattern in the TCP connection it sees originating from the exit node . 3 ) After sometime the download process is stopped and the server halts the traffic shaping procedure . 4 ) The adversary obtains network statistics from flow records corresponding to the server to exit traffic and for the various clients that used the victim entry node for the duration of the attack experiment . 5 ) If the flows are not correctly aligned , equally long and evenly separated , then the adversary applies the approximation strategy to correctly align them . 6 ) The adversary thereafter computes correlation coefficient for the server to exit traffic network statistics and for all the individual clients that used the victim entry node during the attack experiment . 7 ) The victim client \u00e2\u0080\u0099s statistics is expected to be most correlated to the server to exit node traffic . Thus the client , whose traffic statistics are most correlated to the exit node traffic are chosen as the victim and verified . Basically , if the NSA controlled a service you were trying to access via Tor , they could send specially shaped packets to act as a sort of label . Even though the data is encrypted and anonymised through Tor ( between the entry and exit nodes ) , if the NSA controlled a lot of routers or major Internet exchange points , they could still track the special packets from the server to the first exit - node , through the middlemen , and finally ( and imperatively ) back through the original entry node & back to your original connection . But that 's not nearly ELI5 enough so I 'll do a * really simplified * analogy which gets the idea across : * * TL;DR * * - say Tor was n't actually an Internet thing and instead was a way of anonymously sending physical mail . If the sender of the parcel was malicious ( eg , an NSA controlled honeypot site ) they could send out really heavy parcels instead of normal , small , letters . So even if the parcel gets repackaged in different boxes or wrapping paper with new labels on ( the middlemen trying to anonymise the post ) , at the end of the day , the client is still going to be receiving a really heavy ass parcel . Even though it may look different , the weight of the packet indicates it 's the same packet which the NSA sent out . Which , in and of itself is pretty useless . But if the NSA controlled most of the postmen , they can just ask them if anyone got a really heavy parcel delivered that day . If they 're lucky , one of the postmen they control remembers delivering a super heavy parcel to 23 Jump Road , Michigan , USA . And then you 're fucked . But critically this relies on two things : having control of the end server , and being able to monitor major Internet exchange points in near real - time , and we 're talking hundreds if not thousands of gigabytes per second here . Theoretically yes Tor is vulnerable but this paper does n't prove it can actually be exploited in any meaningful manner to intercept communications between two end users that want to remain anonymous .",
      "Let me start with this I'M NOT A LAWYER OR AN IT PROFESSIONAL Now that we got that out of the way . I 'll explain to you my understanding ( which could be very wrong ) There have been rumors that the FBI , DEA , and NSA have some part in TOR , and as such it is compromised , and is no safer then the regular web . I have n't seen evidence to confirm that however that does n't mean it 's not true . With that being said from my understanding it 's commonly accepted that TOR alone is n't safe enough . You have to follow to a T their instructions to make sure you are running things exactly as they say ie no flash , etc . In addition to that most people recommend using VPN . Using Starbucks internet rather than you 're home connection could n't hurt also . From what I understand just browsing the deep web is n't illegal .... viewing illegal materials / purchasing illegal materials is a whole other story . Use bitcoin only .... use escrow . Use Escrow . USE ESCROW ! ! ! ! ! Once said package arrives ( Do n't use your name . Any decent vendor will know this also ) When the box comes bring it in but do n't open it . Not for at least 3 business days .

      "TOR, or The Onion Router, is a network that allows users to browse the internet anonymously by routing their traffic through multiple layers of servers, or \"nodes,\" before it reaches its destination. This makes it difficult for anyone to trace the traffic back to the original user. \nHowever, TOR is not completely foolproof, and there are ways that an attacker could potentially deanonymize a victim using the TOR network. One way this could happen is if the attacker is able to compromise a node in the TOR network and monitor the traffic passing through it. If the victim is using a vulnerable device or operating system, the attacker may be able to exploit a security flaw to reveal the victim's IP address or other identifying information. \nAnother way an attacker could potentially deanonymize a victim using TOR is by setting up a \"fake\" node on the TOR network and enticing the victim to connect to it. The attacker could then monitor the victim's traffic and potentially reveal their identity. \nIt's important to remember that while TOR can help protect your anonymity online, it is not a guarantee of complete anonymity. It's always a good idea to use caution and take steps to secure your device and protect your personal information when using the internet, whether you're using TOR or not.",

    "human_answer": [
      "they really did nt . But often you knew where ships were likely to be . There are only so many ports , and the bigger a ship the bigger a port it needs to be able to dock . A pirate might wait in the shipping lanes a day or two outside of a busy port and wait for a target . Or he might wait for a ship to dock and become a sitting target in an undefended port . A third choice is to cruise near nautical choke points like between islands or outside sandbars . Large convoys of vessels also usually took predictable routes , there was a range of a few degrees which offered the fastest trip to and from Europe due to trade winds and currents , and ships tried to avoid sailing in storm and hurricane season so there tended to be a good deal of activity when it was optimal for sailing . Once a ship was in sight it was then just a matter of who was the better seaman , or which ship was to windward , and in many cases some luck . Ships might be in sight but 20 miles away and still be in a chase .",
      "The ocean is endless but interesting places are not . I 'll assume here that the sail is n't on the horizon and we 're starting from scratch . Write a letter to everyone you know to every possible port and ship your target might encounter . Then make copies . Leave the letters for the packets to pick up . Packets were small , robust , but fairly fast ships that were the stagecoaches of the day . Part bus , part mail service , and always smelly and cramped . The packets would run a route picking up your letters and dropping them off at the destinations . Some packets would n't make it or the mail would simply be destroyed enroute . Which is why you made copies . Other times the packet would leave a letter in every port intended for a specific ship . Which is why you made copies . With luck and few weeks or a few months later the letters would be read . Your friends write back and describe the condition of the ship , where it was seen , and what activity it may be up to . Which you 'll read weeks or months later . However now you have a reasonable idea where to start the search . If the ship has weed on the hull then it will be slow and easier to catch . If the ship 's rigging is old and frayed then it will be slow and easier to catch . If the ship 's sails are thin and patched then it will be slow and easier to catch . So now you have an estimate of the speed . Then does the ship have enough water ? Is the ship using gunpowder excessively or conservatively ? Now you can start to guess how well supplied the ship is . This gives an idea of intent . Once the search region is known then it 's all about guessing where the ship will head next . Does the ship head for fresh water ? Does the ship head to a port for food or supplies ? Does the ship head to sea for mischief ? There are only so many interesting places to go . The most direct routes between these places form routes . Guess the destination and either get there first or attempt to intercept the ship at sea between destinations . Wait for days or weeks . Guess right and the sail should appear on the horizon . Now the chase begins . The winner is the faster ship or the one that does n't make the mistake . Luck , such as with the weather gauge , plays a huge factor on who chases whom . Guess wrong and spend the next few weeks or months repeating the process .",

      "Before radar and sonar were invented, pirates and navies used a variety of methods to track down other ships. One common method was to use visual clues, such as looking for the sails or smoke from the ship's chimney. They might also use telescopes or other instruments to help them spot ships at a distance. \nAnother method was to use the stars and other celestial bodies as navigation aids. By looking at the position of the stars and other celestial objects, sailors could determine their own location and the direction they were heading. They could then use this information to figure out where other ships might be located. \nSailors also used maps and charts to help them navigate the oceans. These could show them the locations of land masses, reefs, and other hazards, as well as the directions of the currents and winds. By using these tools, sailors could plan their routes and figure out the best way to reach their destination. \nFinally, sailors might use their own senses, such as hearing and smell, to help them locate other ships. For example, they might be able to hear the sound of another ship's anchor being dropped or the smell of wood smoke from its chimney. \nOverall, while tracking down other ships was difficult before the invention of modern technology, sailors were still able to use a variety of tools and techniques to navigate the oceans and locate other ships.",

    "human_answer": [
      "Mixing light together is simple addition . Adding red light to green light gives you yellow light , add in blue and get white light . Paint , on the other hand , is about absorption and reflection . Yellow paint absorbs blue light , and reflects red and green . Red paint absorbs green and blue light , and reflects red . Mix them together and you get a paint that absorbs blue light , absorbs half of green light and reflects the other half , and reflects red : orange paint .",
      "Sources of light use what 's called an additive color model . Each source adds new wavelengths , thus the collective light is the sum of all sources . Thus when you have a red and green light , your eyes are receiving both red and green bands of light . Paints and pigments use a subtractive color model . In this case , the material absorbs some wavelengths and reflects others . No new wavelengths are added . Thus mixing colored paints , it will absorb more colors , causing fewer wavelengths to be reflected back . If mathematically inclined , think of additive sources as a union and substractive pigments as an intersect .",
      "The light you see is a result of what light is being reflected by an object . So if you shine green with red , you see yellow in light . But paints differ in the color they absorb . So mixing red ( which absorbs blue and yellow lights but reflects red ) and green ( which absorbs red and reflects blue and yellow ) together gives you something that absorbs red , blue , and yellow . If they were perfectly opposed , you 'd make black . Instead , you usually end up with brown because the two paints are n't diametrically opposed ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "Mixing different colors of light actually does result in a different color, just like mixing paint does. The difference is in how our eyes and brains interpret the colors. \nWhen you mix two colors of paint together, the pigments in the paint absorb certain wavelengths of light and reflect others. For example, red paint reflects red light and absorbs other colors. When you mix red and green paint together, the resulting color is a brownish color because the pigments in the paint are absorbing all of the colors of light except for brown. \nOn the other hand, when you mix two colors of light together, like red and green, the resulting color is a bright yellow because the light is actually adding together. This is because light is made up of different wavelengths of energy, and when you mix two colors of light together, you are adding the wavelengths of energy together. \nSo, the reason why mixing paint results in a different color than mixing light is because paint absorbs certain wavelengths of light, while light adds different wavelengths of energy together.",

Many view this as an injustice which greatly harms farmers , especially small farmers who may not be able to afford yearly purchases and can not compete with the yields and qualities that monsanto seeds allow . The final one that I 'm aware of is that monsanto 's use of GMO technology is to create resistance to round - up and other pesticides . This has two implications .

      "They are really quite different . HTML is the language that websites are written in . It describes what elements are in the page and how they 're organized ( elements such as text , images , buttons and links ) . However , HTML originally did n't include the ability to show graphics , animations or videos ( other than pre - rendered images and animated gifs ) . HTML did provide the ability to include embedded objects , which would require the user to install a plugin that could display them . One such common plugin was Flash , which was basically another small program that runs inside your browser ( another such plugin is Java which can display Java Applets , but they 're hardly in use anymore ) . So developers could use Flash to create things like games ( such as the ones you 'll find in URL_0 ) and video players ( such as YouTube ) . HTML5 introduces new features to HTML , mainly the support for the < canvas > and < video > elements . These tags could be used to display graphics and videos without the need for an external plugin , and were handled by the browser and not by the plugin . HTML5 introduces many other new features , but these are the ones that are most relevant to this discussion ( HTML5 vs Flash ) . The main advantage of HTML5 is that it 's a standard that 's supported ( or should be supported ) by every browser . On the contrary , Flash is no longer supported by Apple 's devices , and by Android 's stock browser . Another disadvantage of Flash is that it 's considered slow and inefficient .",

IMO ( as a Solution Architect - a person who designs large scale software systems ) and former software engineer and web developer HTML5 is far superior .

HTML5 is a version of the HTML programming language that is used to create the structure and layout of websites and web applications. \nAs a user, it's important to know that Flash and HTML5 are not directly competing technologies. They are simply two different ways of creating and displaying content on the internet, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. \nHere are some key differences between Flash and HTML5: \nCompatibility: Flash requires a separate plug-in to be installed in your web browser in order to work, while HTML5 is built into most modern browsers and does not require any additional software. This means that HTML5 content is generally more widely compatible and can be accessed on a wider range of devices, including smartphones and tablets.\nPerformance: HTML5 content tends to perform better than Flash content, especially on mobile devices. This is because HTML5 content is designed to be lightweight and efficient, while Flash content can be more resource-intensive and may not run as smoothly on some devices.\nSecurity: Flash has a reputation for being less secure than HTML5, as it is more susceptible to malware and other types of online threats. HTML5, on the other hand, has built-in security features that help to protect against these types of threats. \nUltimately, which technology is \"better\" for you as a user will depend on your specific needs and preferences.

If you put the pizza in an oven that is not hot enough, it will take longer to cook and the crust may not turn out as crispy as you'd like. \nAs for the instructions to keep the pizza frozen while preheating the oven, this is probably because the pizza will cook more evenly if it goes into the oven frozen. When the pizza is frozen, the heat of the oven will thaw and cook it gradually, rather than going straight from cold to hot and potentially cooking unevenly. \nOverall, following the instructions on the pizza box (such as preheating the oven and keeping the pizza frozen) can help you achieve the best possible results when cooking your pizza.",

    "question": "How does Amazon get their items shipped to your house so quickly , no matter what it is ? Do they have big factories in every state carrying every possible item they sell ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Amazon fills up their distribution centers with popular items that are quickly sold . When you order something through Amazon from some store that you 've never heard of on the far side of the country , Amazon picks up an identical copy ( if they have one in stock ) from the closest distribution center to where you live and ship it out nearly immediately . The one from the store replaces the one in the distribution center . This is why sometimes a description will make a used item sound in poor shape , but when you get it , it 's better than you expected . This is how you can get popular or common items easily , but if you order something really weird or off the wall , it has to actually come from that store , through Amazon and then to your house and takes a lot longer . I used to work in a distribution center .",

      "Amazon has a very efficient system for getting items shipped to customers quickly. Here's how it works: \n1. When you order something from Amazon, the company uses its computer systems to find the item you want in one of its many warehouses around the world. These warehouses are like giant stores where Amazon keeps all of the items it sells. \n2. Once the computer finds the item, it tells a worker to pick it up and put it in a box. \n3. The box is then sent to a sorting facility, where it is sorted and sent to a package delivery company like FedEx or UPS. \n4. The delivery company then takes the box and brings it to your house. \nSo, Amazon doesn't necessarily have big factories in every state, but it does have a network of warehouses around the world where it keeps a wide variety of items. When you order something from Amazon, the company is able to quickly find the item and get it shipped to you through this system.",

    "question": "how is filibustering even a thing ? Why is filibustering even considered a valid tactic in politics ? Why is it simply not dismissed and does it have any practical uses ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Filibustering is a tactic that evolved in the Senate . It 's often called a \" parliamentary procedure , \" as it results not from constitutional law but the internal rules of the legislature . In order to allow time for a bill to be discussed and debated , a 60 vote majority is required to proceed from discussion to a vote . Senators realized they could exploit this rule to keep the majority from passing a bill , unless they had a 60 - vote majority ( a \" Fillibuster - proof majority . \" Filibusters used to require a significant investment of time . Senators grew weary of the pain of a filibuster , and today , the mere threat of a filibuster is enough to get a bill withdrawn due to the time involved ( [ Senators in the past were known to read recipes , Shakespeare , anything in sight ] ( URL_0 ) ) Now , to your questions : Why is it valid ? Because it works for the minority party . Why is it not simply dismissed ? No majority will eliminate it because they know it will be useful to them in the future . You 'll hear of the \" Nuclear Option \" from time to time , a threat to eliminate the filibuster by changing the rules ( by simple majority ) . So far , it has not happened . I would n't be surprised to see it happen in the next congress - the rise of use of filibuster is unprecedented ( the filibuster itself is less than 100 years old ) and scorched - earth politicking has become more and more common inside the beltway . Does it have any practical uses ? Yes : It 's a tool for the minority party to block particularly controversial legislation .",
      "The point is to make sure that a tightly - knit majority does n't run roughshod over the minority . It is , by design , a stalling tactic to try and put the brakes on the discussion until the minority thinks there has been sufficient debate . Originally you had to actually filibuster -- that is , get up and talk ( the way that Rand Paul and Ted Cruz did fairly recently ) , but the Senate has expanded its use to allow Senators to just declare that they are filibustering . Ultimately the check on its use is in overuse -- if you use it too often , you and your party start to develop a bad name and lose even more seats . It actually was used in the House of Representatives until the mid-19th century , when it got way out of hand and the rules were changed .",

      "Filibustering is a tactic used by politicians in some countries, including the United States, to try to block or delay a vote on a bill or proposal. It's called filibustering because it can involve a politician giving a very long speech or talking for a long time in order to delay the vote. \nFilibustering is considered a valid tactic in politics because it allows politicians to have a say in the decision-making process and to express their views and concerns. It can also be used as a way to force a compromise or a change in the proposal being considered. \nHowever, filibuster can also be used as a way to block or delay important decisions or progress on important issues. Some people argue that filibuster should be reformed or limited in order to allow the government to function more efficiently and to make sure that important issues are not held up for too long. \nOverall, filibuster can be a useful tactic for ensuring that all voices are heard and for allowing for discussion and debate, but it can also be abused and used to obstruct the work of the government.",

You go there today and you do n't see it , but Brevard County in the 1940s was a bunch of orchards and hardly anything else .

This is one of the problems that [ the Soviet Union ] had with Baikonur [ Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan ] , their launch site . I mean , it is in the middle of nowhere .

One reason is because Florida is close to the equator, which makes it easier to launch rockets into space.

Since then, many other important space missions have launched from Florida, including the Apollo missions to the Moon and the space shuttle program. \nFinally, Florida has a lot of open space and good weather, which makes it a good place to test and launch rockets.

      "Hi ! I 'm from New York . You 've gotten some good answers , but maybe I can help go more in - depth . The very first thing to remember is that in more expensive cities , wages rise with cost inflation . Now , it 's not a perfect scale-- most of the cost inflation comes because many people are * very * rich , not necessarily because the poor are less poor . However , it 's still a factor-- there are fewer minimum wage jobs , and/or you 're more likely to get a job whose wages are above the federal minimum . In other words , chances are the same job netting you $ 7.25 in Nebraska will get you around $ 10 in NYC . Now that 's not 100 % true . There are still * some * minimum wage jobs here . How do people get by ? Well , about like anywhere else , I suppose . They do n't get to enjoy many aspects of the city where inflation has taken hold . They do n't get to go out to dinner at the nice restaurants or go drinking in NYC bars . They ca n't go to Whole Foods , they have to go to cheaper grocery stores . They have to curb themselves more , and * * they get government assistance * * like anywhere else . Remember , the farther you go from NYC the cheaper things get , so many times people will live far away from the city if they do n't make a lot . And if they 're living far away from the city , and working a minimum wage job ... they can just as easily find one near where they live . Hence , like I said , there being less minimum wage jobs in the city . It all ... * kinda * evens out . You 're not likely to live in NYC and have a minimum wage job as an adult . Matter of fact I ca n't think of a single minimum wage job I 've had , and I 've made the rounds as a student . Office worker , busboy , waiter , receptionist ... they all paid around $ 10 . And one last thing to remember : The cost of living does n't * have * to be high in this city . It 's totally doable on less money . The reason it seems higher is that it * can * be higher . And most people making very little tend to have a social circle where people make standard ( remember how I said there are n't many minimum wage jobs here ? It 's rare ) So what happens is most of your friends can go do things and spend money where you can't-- so it * seems * like everything has to be so expensive here . But it does n't , really . Like I said earlier , there are cheap places to live , there are cheap restaurants , cheap grocery stores . There are plenty of free activities for entertainment . This city actually caters very well to the poor , it 's just difficult if your social circle is n't as poor as you ."

Many people are staying at home and not driving as much, which means there is less demand for gasoline. When there is less demand for a product, the price of that product tends to go down. \nFinally, some countries produce and export a lot of oil, and the price of oil is often influenced by the relationships between these countries and how they trade with each other. If there is a lot of oil being produced and exported by certain countries, it can help to lower the price of gasoline. \nSo, in summary, gas prices have gone down because there is currently a lot of oil being produced, people are using less gasoline due to the pandemic, and the relationships between oil-producing countries can also affect the price.",

      "The Double Jeopardy Clause is a part of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. It states that no person shall \"be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\" This means that if someone is acquitted (found not guilty) of a crime, they cannot be tried again for the same crime. \nThe Double Jeopardy Clause is designed to protect people from being subjected to the stress and expense of multiple trials for the same crime. It also helps to prevent the government from using its power to try to punish someone over and over again until it gets the result it wants. \nHowever, there are some exceptions to the Double Jeopardy Clause. For example, if new evidence is discovered that was not available at the time of the original trial, it may be possible to bring someone to trial again for the same crime. Additionally, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not apply in cases where the crime was committed in different states or in cases where the person was tried in both a state court and a federal court.",

Banksy's art has a distinctive style that is instantly recognizable to many people, and experts can often tell if a piece of graffiti is by Banksy just by looking at it. \nAnother way to tell if a piece of graffiti is by Banksy is by looking at the location where it was created. Banksy often creates his graffiti in secret and in unexpected places, so if a piece of graffiti is found in a place where Banksy is known to have worked, it is more likely to be by him. \nFinally, experts can also use other clues to determine if a piece of graffiti is by Banksy, such as the materials and techniques that were used to create it. For example, Banksy often uses stencils to create his graffiti, so if a piece of graffiti was made using stencils, it is more likely to be by him. \nOverall, while it is not always possible to know for certain if a piece of graffiti is by Banksy or not, experts can use a combination of these methods to make an educated guess.",

This means that we might use \"she\" or \"her\" to refer to a ship or a car, even though these things are not alive and do not have a gender. This is a way of speaking that we have inherited from the way that English has evolved over time, and it is not based on any inherent qualities of the objects themselves. \nOne reason why we might use \"she\" to refer to a ship is because ships have traditionally been given feminine names, especially in naval contexts. For example, a ship might be named after a woman or a mythological figure, such as the USS Constitution (also known as \"Old Ironsides\") which was named after the United States Constitution. Because ships are often given feminine names, it has become common to refer to them using feminine pronouns. \nIt's also worth noting that different languages have different ways of referring to inanimate objects. In some languages, all nouns are either masculine or feminine, and the gender of the noun determines the gender of the pronoun used to refer to it. In English, this is not the case, and we can use any pronoun to refer to an inanimate object.",

      "Suddenly or gradually ? If it was suddenly , we 're all fucked because the Earth is rotating really fast and we 're all rotating with it . If the Earth stops , we do n't , and we go fucking flying . If gradually ... days cycle slower and slower and eventually stop , things start to go very wrong . This is actually happening due to the influence of the Moon 's gravity - given another few billion years the Earth and the Moon would be tidally locked to each other and the same side of the Earth would always face the Moon , with no more planetary rotation . The Sun will die out before that happens though .",

If it 's day when the Earth stopped , then by the time it was night time it 'd be a vast desert . The other side would be a frozen tundra . If anything alive somehow survived the initial throwing , it would probably die of heat exhaustion or the water drying up . However , this would not be the case for underground things . We could * possibly * survive in large underground vaults . However , the surface world would sadly become uninhabitable . But this may be a bit scary for your daughter .

      "If the Earth stopped spinning, it would be a very big problem! Here's why: \n1. The Earth spins on its axis, which is an imaginary line that goes through the North Pole and South Pole. This is what makes it feel like the sun is rising and setting every day. If the Earth stopped spinning, the sun would just stay in one place in the sky and it would be very hot on one side of the Earth and very cold on the other side. \n2. The Earth's spin also helps to keep the oceans moving. If the Earth stopped spinning, the oceans would all pile up on one side of the Earth, and there would be a huge wave on the other side. \n3. The Earth's spin also helps to keep the atmosphere moving. If the Earth stopped spinning, the air would all pile up on one side of the Earth and there would be very strong winds on the other side. \n4. Finally, if the Earth stopped spinning, everything on the Earth would be thrown off into space. This includes all the people, animals, and buildings on the Earth. It would be a very big mess! \nSo, in short, if the Earth stopped spinning it would be a very big problem and cause a lot of problems for everyone and everything on the Earth.",

      "In American football, the team with possession of the ball (called the offense) has four chances, or downs, to move the ball 10 yards down the field. If they are successful in moving the ball 10 yards, they earn another set of downs. If the offense fails to move the ball 10 yards, possession of the ball is turned over to the other team (called the defense). \nOne way for the offense to move the ball is by throwing it through the air (called a pass). The offense can also try to move the ball by running with it (called a rush). \nIn the situation you are describing, it was probably considered \"bad\" for the Seattle Seahawks to pass the ball because it may not have been the most effective way for them to move the ball and get closer to scoring. There could be a number of reasons why passing the ball may not have been the best choice, such as the defense anticipating the pass and intercepting the ball, or the quarterback (the player who throws the ball) not having enough time to throw the ball due to pressure from the defense. \nIt's also possible that the team had been trying to pass the ball and were not having success, and so it may have been more effective for them to try to run the ball or use a different strategy to try to move the ball down the field. Ultimately, the team's decision on whether to pass or run the ball will depend on a variety of factors, including the specific strengths and weaknesses of the offense and defense, the situation on the field, and the overall game plan.",

      "Doctors can use several different methods to find out if a person has allergies. One common method is to do a skin prick test. During this test, a small amount of an allergen (such as a substance that a person might be allergic to) is placed on the skin, and then a needle is used to prick the skin through the allergen. If the person is allergic to the allergen, they will develop a raised bump or rash on their skin. \nAnother way to test for allergies is to do a blood test. During this test, a blood sample is taken from the person and sent to a laboratory, where it is tested for the presence of antibodies to specific allergens. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body's immune system in response to an allergen. If the person has allergies, their blood will contain high levels of these antibodies. \nIt's important to note that doctors do not usually test for allergies by exposing a person to the allergen directly. This is because allergies can cause serious reactions, such as difficulty breathing or a drop in blood pressure, and it would be dangerous to intentionally trigger these reactions. Instead, doctors use safer methods, such as skin prick tests and blood tests, to test for allergies.",

    "question": "Why is cancer the most common disease associated with DNA mutations ? Is such a large part of DNA devoted to guiding cell reproduction that mutations always seem to lead to cancer ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Of all the things that mutations cause ( that is , mutations that happen * after * a person has been born ) , most of them probably just end up with the mutated DNA getting repaired or removed , or the cell that contains it being destroyed through programmed cell death . Cancer is the result of a mutation that removes the cell 's ability to repair or quarantine mutations . It is n't that so much of DNA is devoted to reproduction that any one mutation is likely to damage that section of the DNA . It 's that , of all the mutations that happen , the ones that can survive and reproduce are necessarily the ones that alter the normal reproduction / cell death processes ( and these are the mutations that cause cancer . )",
      "Other mutations exist , but one cell having some odd mutation does n't do much . Mutations that lead to uncontrolled cell division cause that one cell to become exponentially more cells .",
      "So , with cancer , what is actually happening is a few things . First of all its not just one mutation . Your body mutates constantly , DNA is always messed up , and even then your RNA gets spliced up and you are making faulty proteins all the time . Mutation is actually how things evolve partly . The concept with cancer is actually different than just mutation . Think of a car . If you cut the gas , well it wo n't move . Sometimes DNA will mutate and your body will find it and wo n't make it duplicate or be transcribed during transcription . Now DNA also can actually not be picked up by \" scanners \" when it mutates sometimes . We can call this cutting the breaks . So during transcription lots of crap happens that 's not supposed to , and so we just let it go inside the cell and push everything that has been made out of the nucleus to get eaten up by lysosomses ( cell stomachs ) . Now normally for actually cancer to happen , we need about 5 breaks cut and 10 gas pedals broken . It takes a lot of DNA fuckup to actually cause cancer . And if it does happen , we have this awesome enzyme called p53 , which Is actually one GIGANTIC and I mean FUCKING HUGE protein made to just deal with cancer . An about 5000 different enzymes to detect it and stop it . Cells also realize there is cancerous cells and go about trying to kill it , but then if we cut another 5 break lines and another 4 gas pedals in that cancerous cell , it wo n't tell other cells its cancerous . After that there s a tint threshold were the cell will try to kill itself , but one more break line cut , and that 's it . Its pretty hard for this process to occur . But realize mutations happen like a thousand times a minute , and the \" gas pedals \" and \" break lines \" of DNA replication , transcription , and translation , are happening all the time ."

      "Cancer is not the most common disease associated with DNA mutations. In fact, most DNA mutations do not cause any significant problems or diseases. However, some DNA mutations can cause problems with the way cells function, and can lead to the development of cancer. \nCancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow and divide in an uncontrolled way. Normal cells in the body follow a specific pattern of growth and division, but cancer cells do not. They continue to grow and divide even when the body does not need them, and they do not die when they should. This can lead to the formation of tumors, which can be harmful if they grow in certain parts of the body or if they spread to other parts of the body. \nThere are many different factors that can increase the risk of developing cancer, including genetics, environmental factors, and lifestyle factors. DNA mutations can play a role in the development of cancer, but they are not the only cause. \nSo, to answer your question: DNA mutations can sometimes lead to cancer, but this is not always the case.

    "question": "Why do n't multi winged planes work ? [ Planes like this ] ( URL_0 ) alternatively why do planes typically have two or four wings ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "they do work . biplanes and triplanes were quite advantageous in WWI . but the more wings you put on , the more lift you get , but the more drag and more strengthing structure you need to add .",
      "See the company Scaled Composites for some really interesting designs . Essentially it comes down to this : you want to create as much lift as possible , for as little drag as possible , using the smallest amount of weight possible . And , of course , it has to be structurally sound . The plane in the picture would probably collapse . The wings are creating drag , so they are all being pushed backward , and those skinny pylons would likely break . On top of that , the drag would be trying to tip the plane backward . Even if it was strong enough , it would n't fly well , if at all . Multiple wings do work , and did for all of WWI , but a more powerful engine , a stronger single wing , and a swept back wing shape are all designed for strength and efficiency . The most efficient design is two long skinny wings , but material strength has n't quite made that possible for commercial use .",
      "It 's not so much that they ca n't work , but rather that there 's no need . Your question is sort of like asking why do n't cars have 8 wheels . Early airplane prototypes lacked solid aerodynamic information for how to design wings and , as a result , had very inefficient wings ( very little lift generated ) . Rather than redesign the wings , many early aviators simply tried adding more wings . Of course , the problem with this was making sure that the structure to support all the wings was strong enough , which it often was n't . For example , here 's some newsreel footage of the same plane in the image you linked ( the [ Gerhardt Cycleplane ] ( URL_1 ) ): URL_0 Once aerodynamics were more well - understood , the need for multiple wings declined and eventually disappeared . It 's also worth noting that planes with multiple sets of wings can have problems if one set produces much more lift than the others . The Fokker Dr. I ( better known as simply the \" Fokker Triplane \" or the \" Red Baron 's plane \" ) , for example , had problems with the top wing producing so much more lift than the other two wings that the top wing would rip itself off of the aircraft at high speeds . This behavior tended to cause problems and was one of many reasons why , despite its prevalence in popular lore , the Dr. I saw only limited use in actual combat . So , the short answer to your question is that , with our ability to generate more than enough lift with a single set of wings , the need for multiple sets of wings has passed ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "Planes with multiple wings, like the one in the image you provided, are called \"multiplane\" or \"sesquiplane\" designs. These designs were experimented with in the early days of aviation, but they were not widely used because they did not perform as well as planes with fewer wings. \nThere are several reasons why planes with multiple wings are not typically used. One reason is that they are more complex and expensive to build than planes with fewer wings. They also tend to be heavier and less efficient, which means that they require more power to fly and use more fuel. \nPlanes with two wings, or \"biplanes,\" were the most common design in the early days of aviation. They are still used today in some specialty applications, such as crop dusting or airshows. Most modern planes, however, have a single, long wing called a \"monoplane.\" This design is more aerodynamic and efficient, and it allows the plane to fly faster and further than a biplane. \nFour-winged planes, or \"quadruplanes,\" have also been experimented with, but they have not been widely used because they do not offer significant advantages over other designs. \nOverall, the number of wings on an airplane is determined by a combination of factors, including the size and weight of the plane, the type of mission it will be used for, and the desired performance characteristics. Engineers and designers carefully consider these factors when designing a new plane to ensure that it is safe, efficient, and capable of meeting the needs of its intended use.",

Something has to specifically select _ against _ the useless feature . If having wisdom teeth made people less attractive , or raised the likelihood of them dying before reproducing , then we could postulate that there would be evolutionary pressure against larger wisdom teeth and that , over time , more and more people with smaller wisdom teeth would be selected , leading to a gradual evolutionary decline in wisdom teeth .

      "Wisdom teeth, also known as third molars, are the last teeth to emerge in the mouth, usually appearing in the late teenage years or early twenties. These teeth were once an important part of the human diet because they helped people chew tough and fibrous foods that were common in our ancestors' diets. \nHowever, as our diets have changed and become softer over time, wisdom teeth have become less necessary. In many people, there is not enough room in the mouth for the wisdom teeth to emerge properly, which can cause problems such as pain, infection, and crowding of the other teeth. \nIt's not entirely clear why wisdom teeth still exist if they can cause so many problems.

A grand jury is a group of people that the prosecutor has to convince he has a case . He does n't have to prove that the defendant is guilty , just that there 's enough evidence that it 's OK to bring charges against them . The idea here is that the trial itself should not be inflicted upon someone who is obviously innocent \u00e2\u0080\u0094 bringing charges must not be a weapon against innocent charges . Charging innocent people can still happen , but this step is intended to minimize it . The controversy is that generally grand juries are very easy to convince and many see them as a formality more than anything . When a high profile case does n't get an indictment ( i.e. a formal accusation against someone that a crime was committed ; pronounced in - dight - ment ) it raises a question of whether the prosecutor was really trying to get the grand jury to indict . Many feel that even though the officer in the Ferguson case would likely have been found innocent that it was not the prosecutor 's place to present such a weak case to the grand jury in order to stop the case then and there .",
      "The constitution says : > No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the Militia , when in actual service in time of War or public danger In otherwords : Someone accused of committing murder has to have a Grand Jury say there 's probable cause for a trial . So : Step 1 : Grand Jury : is there enough evidence to have a trial for murder . Step 2 : Regular Jury : is he guilty of murder ? You do n't hear about Grand Juries because in over 99 % of cases brought , Grand Juries indict . Partially , because you only need 12 of 16 - 23 members to support indictment . At the federal level , [ 538 reports ] ( URL_0 ) 161,989 of 162,000 federal grand juries indict .",
      "The grand jury is a preliminary proceeding for the purpose of deciding whether there is a good enough reason to have a trial . The difference between a grand jury and a normal jury ( i.e. , a trial ) is that a grand jury is a closed , one - sided hearing where the prosecutor is tasked with demonstrating that there is probable cause to believe that a defendant committed the particular crime . Usually , a two - thirds supermajority agreement among the jurors is required to \" indict \" the defendant ( i.e. , two - thirds of the jurors must agree that there exists probable cause to believe the defendant committed a crime , thus warranting a full trial ) . If two - thirds of the jurors indict the defendant , it does not mean he is convicted . It means there is enough evidence that there should be a full trial . Unlike during the grand jury , at a full trial the defendant enjoys his sixth amendment rights to counsel , to confront his accusers , and to a public proceeding . What I mean is that during a grand jury the defendant has no right to call his own witnesses , nor cross - examine witnesses that testify against him ( or more accurately have a lawyer do those things ) , and he has no right to public oversight . During a trial the defendant has a right to a lawyer , who can introduce evidence and call witnesses on his behalf and cross - examine opposing witnesses in an a hearing opened to public oversight . Also , the trial requires the jury to unanimously vote that he committed the crime beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict him . This is a much harder standard than the grand jury 's 2/3 's majority vote for probable cause . It 's also worth noting that not all states employ grand juries . For example , in my state a preliminary hearing substitutes for the grand jury . During my state 's preliminary hearings , the prosecutor is tasked with introducing evidence before a judge ( without a jury ) , and the defendant has the right to have a lawyer argue against that evidence and cross examine the prosecutor 's witnesses . In this scenario the judge ( and not a jury ) decides whether there is enough probable cause for the case to go to trial . This is not to say that some states only do grand juries , and other states only do preliminary hearings . My state has certain policies where it will use a grand jury rather than a preliminary hearing , e.g. , where there is a danger of witness intimidation . I do n't know whether my state would use a grand jury for a capital case against a cop . Technically it would be at the District Attorney 's discretion , but it 's probably really just politics . Also , it should be noted that the rules regarding whether or not there must be a grand jury is different in federal courts . The fifth amendment preserves a defendant 's right to a grand jury for all \" capital , or otherwise infamous crime[s ] \" in federal courts . To sum it up , a grand jury is a process with a very low burden of proof for the purpose of deciding whether a full trial is necessary . Some states use preliminary hearings more often . Serious federal crimes require grand juries . And , some states courts use grand juries rather than preliminary hearings for specific cases ."

      "A grand jury is a group of people who are chosen to decide whether there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime. If the grand jury decides that there is enough evidence, they will issue a \"true bill\" of indictment, which means that the person will be charged with a crime and will have to go to trial. \nGrand juries are different from normal juries in a few ways. One difference is that grand juries don't decide whether someone is guilty or not guilty. Their job is only to decide if there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime. Grand juries also don't have to follow the same rules as a normal trial. For example, the person being investigated by the grand jury doesn't have the right to be present or to have a lawyer present during the grand jury proceedings. \nIt's not uncommon for police officers to appear before a grand jury when they are being investigated for a crime. This might happen if someone has accused the police officer of wrongdoing, or if there is evidence that the officer broke the law. If the grand jury decides that there is enough evidence to charge the police officer with a crime, then the officer will have to go to trial to face those charges.",

    "question": "What makes one tire better than another ? Why does the tire on a Bugatti cost $ 5000 but the tire on my Cruze costs $ 150 ? What 's the difference ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Suitability for purpose , where purpose has a number of dimensions . For the Bugatti , one of the dimensions has to be \" can survive the 250MPH top speed of the car , \" and cost is going to be much less of a factor , given the market space the car is aimed at ( the extremely wealthy ) . For a Cruze , budget pricing is going to be high on the list , and the top speed is maybe as high as 130MPH at a guess . Other dimensions include wet and dry grip , cold weather performance , rolling resistance ( very helpful for high EPA fuel economy estimates ) , road noise , resistance to wear , special features like runflat capability , etc . , etc . The formulation of the rubber compounds that go into the tire , the design of the tread , the layout of the steel ( and other materials ? ) belts that go into the casing , etc . , are all informed by which criteria are emphasized in the tire 's design .",
      "A number of factors determine the cost of a tyre : * Speed ratings define how fast the tire can safely be driven - bigger more powerful vehicles require a different tyre to small / slow cars and as a result the tyres cost more ( see [ speed rating table ] ( URL_0 ) ) . * Load index - how much weight is the tyre expected to carry , this will have an impact on price * Width / Rim Size - the wider of tyre and size of the rim all adjust thevolume of rubber required and bigger tyres can require more complex tire designs . Your little car might take be R15 160/180 wide , a BMW Z4 ( for example ) will take R19s 225/255 tyres . * Profile - how ' fat ' is the side - profile ? Most sports cars have low - profile tyres which require different properties than tyres with higher profile ( which are often more economical and a softer ride ! ) . In the UK tyres are rated for fuel efficiency , wet grip and external noise ( [ see here ] ( URL_1 ) ) . Typically cars that score high ( A - rated ) in each of these categories are more expensive . Whether the costs are justifiable is hard to be certain ( as in how much more it costs the manufacturers to make them is not something I know ) but there 's a lot more to tires than just simply all being the same but slightly different sizes .",
      "Economics of scale ... Bugatti tires are not mass produced and therefore the cost of production can not be attributed to as many units . Therefore the costs of R & D , etc . must be recovered over fewer units leading to a higher price . Also , corporations are aware that the consumer purchasing these tires is less price sensitive than your average individual and therefore can extract a higher price without decreasing demand"
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "There are a few factors that can make one tire better than another, and these factors can also contribute to differences in price. \nFirst, let's start with the basics: tires are made of rubber, and they have tread on the bottom that helps them grip the road. Tires also have a sidewall, which is the part of the tire that you can see between the tread and the wheel. The sidewall has important information printed on it, like the size of the tire and the maximum load and speed it can handle. \nNow, let's talk about some of the factors that can make one tire better than another: \n1. Performance: Some tires are designed for specific types of driving or weather conditions. For example, you might want a tire with a softer compound for better grip on a race track, or a tire with a lot of tread for better traction in the rain. Tires that are designed for high performance or specific driving conditions tend to cost more because they require more advanced materials and engineering. \n2. Quality: Tires can also vary in terms of quality, which can affect their performance and lifespan. Higher-quality tires are typically made with better materials and more advanced manufacturing processes, which can make them last longer and perform better. These tires tend to cost more, but they can save you money in the long run because you won't have to replace them as often. \n3. Brand: The brand of the tire can also affect the price. Some tire brands are known for making high-quality, high-performance tires that come with a higher price tag. Other brands might offer more budget-friendly options that may not have the same level of performance or quality. \nSo, to sum it up: tires can vary in price based on their performance, quality, and brand. Tires that are designed for high performance or specific driving conditions, made with high-quality materials and advanced manufacturing processes, or made by a well-known brand tend to cost more.",

      "I 'm not 100 % sure of the process but I imagine basically some people manually identify objects and sets their depth ( e.g. , this actor is really close , that tree is really far ) and then some software applies the appropriate polarization to the film . This is why post - processed 3D files generally have limited depth to a few layers , usually the actors , a few important objects and the background .",
      "For films that use a lot of green / blue screen ( LOTR , Avatar , Avengers ) , the CG background can be made as a 3D object . That way , the only thing that they have to make 3D in post are the actors , and they 're separated already . Also , many older films that used the red and blue glasses were three frames : One that was red , one was blue , and one that was full color . One of the red / blue frames was offset in order to create depth to the image ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "Movies that are not originally filmed in 3D can be converted into 3D in post-production, which means after the movie has already been filmed and is being prepared for release. To do this, the movie is first divided into two separate images, one for the left eye and one for the right eye. These images are then slightly offset from each other to create the illusion of depth when viewed through special glasses that have one red lens and one blue lens (or one green and one magenta). \nThe process of converting a 2D movie into 3D is complex and time-consuming, and it involves using computer software to analyze the images and assign different levels of depth to different objects in the frame. This allows the 3D version of the movie to have a sense of depth and perspective that makes it feel more immersive and realistic. \nSo, to sum it up, movies that are not originally filmed in 3D can be made to look like they were filmed in 3D by using special computer software to create two slightly offset images and adding depth to different objects in the frame. When these images are viewed through special glasses, they create the illusion of 3D.",

      "Sexual Dimorphism - Some species of animals exhibit differences between sexes so that an individual of that species can fulfil they 're reproductive and survival requirements relative to they 're species . the differences can vary for different species and there is no set characteristic for males or females . i.e. in mammals ( particularly social mammals ) males tends to be larger and stronger and physically better adapted to aggression and conflict , females tend to be better suited to child rearing ( before I get hate mail of Feminazis this is biology , not sociology ) .

      "Traditionally, new seasons of TV shows have premiered in the fall because that is when the major networks (like ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox) have their \"upfronts,\" which are presentations to advertisers about the new shows that they will be airing in the upcoming television season. The upfronts usually take place in May, and the new TV seasons begin in September. This allows the networks to promote their new shows to a large audience over the summer, so that people will be more likely to watch when the new seasons begin. \nThere are a few reasons why it might make sense for some shows to come out in the spring or summer instead. For one thing, there is typically less competition for viewership during these times of year, since there are fewer new shows premiering. This can be especially helpful for shows that are trying to establish a strong following and might get lost in the shuffle during the crowded fall season. Additionally, the weather is generally nicer in the spring and summer, which can make it a more appealing time for people to sit down and watch TV. \nOverall, it really depends on the show and what the creators and networks think will be the best time for it to be released.

Another group of countries with no - tax policies are tiny island nations like the Bahamas . for these countries , the populations are small , easing the government 's expenditure and they rely a lot on foreign investment , making it necessary for them to lure investors with favorable tax policies .

      "Countries that operate a no tax policy, like Monaco, still need to find ways to fund their governments and pay for the services they provide to their citizens. One way they can do this is by relying on other sources of income, such as tourism or the sale of goods and services. \nMonaco, for example, is a small country located on the Mediterranean coast in Europe. It is known for its luxury casinos, hotels, and high-end real estate. These industries bring in a lot of money for the government and help fund the services it provides to its citizens, such as education and healthcare. \nAnother way that countries with no tax policy can fund their governments is by charging fees for certain services, such as the use of roads or the sale of licenses. These fees can provide the government with a source of income that can be used to pay for the services it provides to its citizens. \nIt's important to note that while Monaco does not have a traditional tax system, it still has certain requirements for businesses and individuals living and working in the country. For example, businesses must pay fees for the right to operate in Monaco, and individuals must pay fees to live or work in the country. These fees help to fund the services provided by the government.",

    "generated_answer": [
      "White rice is often cheaper than brown rice because it is more processed and has had the bran and germ removed, which are the outer layers of the rice grain. These outer layers contain most of the nutrients, fiber, and flavor of the rice, so brown rice is generally considered to be more nutritious than white rice. However, the processing of white rice is simpler and requires fewer steps, which makes it cheaper to produce. The demand for white rice is also generally higher than that for brown rice, particularly in many developing countries where it is a staple food. This higher demand can also contribute to the lower price of white rice.",

    "human_answer": [
      "Because work goes on virtually every hour of every day in high rises . The office critters occupy and push papers and make up money during the daylight and sometimes into the evening . And Overnight / early morning there are cleaning crews maintenance / repair crews and construction crews and security people wandering about . The tenants in highrise office buildings are constantly changing , whenever a new tenant moves into a floor or subdivides a floor into multiple offices the work on the build out ca n't happen during the day since office critters would get upset if construction men were walking all over their desks and shifting stuff around while they were there . My company occasionally does high rise tenant finish and when the tenant wants a new break room or two , and the executive wants a private bathroom in his corner office then things need to be happening on multiple floors at once . The drainage piping needs to be run on the floor below , which is likely occupied . To install new drainage plumbing in a high rise a large X - ray machine needs to be brought out and shoot beams of radiation up towards the slab to find what locations are available for drilling , ( this needs to be done from the floor below ) then we bring out large core drills which make lots of noise and spray mud everywhere , which requires us to cover all the office folks computers and desks / cabinets and family photos with tarps so when they get back in the morning they do n't know we were romping around their office the previous night . Then we need to take the ceiling grid panels out from the occupied floor and bring in the equipment to install the new piping . Doing any of this during ' working hours ' , everything from bringing in large radiation machines and blasting them between their desks , to covering everyone with tarps and spraying them with mud which making a racket , would piss loads of workers off . Work like what I 'm describing will mean that three floors are completely lit up for the entire night shift , if it 's a 35 story building and 2 - 3 floors are being re - finished and there are two cleaning crews and a security / maintenance crew going around as well then that would mean 10 - 12 floors at a time minimum are lit up so people are able to work . Tl , DR : If the lights are on on a certain floor of a highrise , there are people doing some form of work on that floor , if there are no lights or the lights are dim then the floor is unoccupied at that time . I 've also heard rumors that tall buildings need to keep a certain amount of floors lit up so aeroplanes can see then easier and gauge their height / distance at night .

Keeping the lights on can help people navigate the building and find their way around, especially in case of an emergency. \n2. Security: Another reason is for security. Having the lights on can deter burglars and vandals, and also help security personnel keep an eye on the building. \n3. Convenience: Some people might be working late or overnight in the building, and they might need the lights on to do their work. \n4. Energy efficiency: In some cases, the lights in office buildings and skyscrapers might be designed to be energy efficient, so they don't use as much energy as you might think. Additionally, turning the lights off and on frequently can actually use more energy than leaving them on, because it takes energy to start up the lighting system each time it is turned on. \n5. Cost: Finally, it might be more expensive to turn the lights off and on all the time than to just leave them on. This is because each time the lights are turned on and off, it causes wear and tear on the lighting system, which can shorten its lifespan and increase maintenance costs. \nOverall, there are a number of factors to consider when deciding whether to keep the lights on in an office building or skyscraper, and it's not always as simple as just turning them off to save money.",

    "generated_answer": [
      "Progressive taxation is a system in which people who earn more money pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than people who earn less money. In the United States, the progressive tax system is designed to reduce income inequality by taking a larger percentage of income from people who are more able to pay, and using that money to fund programs and services that benefit the entire population, such as education, healthcare, and social security. \nHowever, there are still many factors that can contribute to inequality in the United States, even with a progressive tax system in place. For example, some people may have access to better education and job opportunities, which can lead to higher incomes. Additionally, there may be systemic biases and discrimination that make it more difficult for certain groups of people to advance in their careers or earn as much as others. \nFinally, the overall distribution of wealth in a society, rather than just income, also plays a role in inequality. Wealth, or the total value of a person's assets (such as their savings, investments, and property), can be passed down from generation to generation, which can create a more unequal distribution of resources over time. \nOverall, while a progressive tax system can help to reduce inequality, it is just one factor among many that contribute to the overall level of inequality in a society.",

    "human_answer": [
      "When any part of our body is touched , nerves in the skin are activated . On the way to the brain , those nerves meet at several junctions or ' gates ' . At those junctions , bunches of nerves coming from nearby all gather together on the way to the brain At each gate , the signals from all the bundled nerves are processed together . Sometimes , two nerves work together to increase each other 's intensity , and sometimes , they dampen each other 's signals . At the same time , nerves coming from the brain work as ' central control ' to change the intensity of the signal that 's being passed on . Again , sometimes the signal is increased , and sometimes it 's decreased . Over the history of their development , our brains have gotten good at learning what signals they should pay attention to , and what signals they can ignore . One of the signals the brain has learned to ' ignore ' is self touch . It is n't dangerous , and we usually only need to be partially aware of it . Walking through a spider web and touching your hand to your face are two different experiences , and for good reason . When the brain identifies self - touch , it uses those feedback fibers I mentioned before to suppress the intensity of sensation , which makes it easier to ignore . Also , when a signal arrives in the brain , several regions cooperate to figure out exactly what it is , where it came from , and what to do about it . When we identify self - touch , there are regions of our brain that are trained to say ' ignore it ' . As a result , we suppress the intensity of those signals .",
      "to put it simply , our nerves have gates that allow certain information to pass , when your scratching the itch yourself those gates are competing with each other to send information about pleasure , as well as touch and muscle contraction . Having someone else do it means there is only the pleasure sensation needing to be sent through those gates , so the pleasure is stronger . an example of this is when your foot falls asleep and it feels like there are hot pins and needles in it . when the flow stops the nerves that react to touch and pressure stop , but the various pain receptors maintain priority and get what little oxygen is in the blood . so once you start using it those pain receptors are n't competing with anything and it 's all you feel .",

      "Landing a spacecraft in a lake would not be a safe or practical way to return to Earth. Here are a few reasons why: \n1. Density: Water is much denser than air, so when a spacecraft falls into it from a high altitude, it will experience much more resistance and deceleration. This could cause the spacecraft to break apart or sustain serious damage upon impact. \n2. Depth: Lakes are typically not very deep, so if a spacecraft were to land in one, it would have to do so at a very low altitude. This would not give the spacecraft enough time to slow down and make a safe landing. \n3. Control: When a spacecraft returns to Earth, it needs to be able to control its descent and land in a specific location. This is not possible when landing in a lake, as the spacecraft would be at the mercy of the wind and currents. \n4. Recovery: Finally, it would be very difficult to recover a spacecraft that has landed in a lake. Specialized equipment would be needed to lift it out of the water, which could be time-consuming and costly. \nIn summary, landing a spacecraft in a lake is not a safe or practical option.

The result is their net worth. \nFor example, if a person has $100,000 in savings, a house worth $300,000, and no debts, their net worth would be $400,000. On the other hand, if that same person had $100,000 in savings, a house worth $300,000, and a mortgage of $200,000, their net worth would be $200,000 (since they would be subtracting the $200,000 mortgage from their total assets of $400,000). \nNet worth is usually calculated by a person themselves, or by a financial advisor or accountant.

    "human_answer": [
      "I think it goes without saying that government is n't really anything like personal debt but it might help put things in perspective using a more familiar idea we can grasp . Part of the problem with the perception of our debt being a big problem is that the numbers are big . Mind bogglingly big . Scary big . Our debt is roughly $ 17,000,000,000,000 . And , yes , that is a big number . But let me show you another number : $ 17,000,000,000,000 . Why , yes . That is the same number . $ 17,000,000,000,000 also happens to be our Gross Domestic Product or GDP , which is what our country produces in a year . Think of the GDP as our annual salary as a country . Now if you met a person who made $ 170,000 a year ( a much easier number to get your head around ) and that person was in debt to the tune of $ 170,000 say with a house a couple of credit cards and that person always paid all of his bills all the time , most people would say that person has very good credit and is n't at risk of going bankrupt and would likely be a particularly good candidate if they decided to get another loan . And so long as their income grows proportionally with their debt and they keep paying their bills , they 'll continue to be a safe bet to continue to receive loans . In other words , if their debt rose to $ 200,000 , that 'd be okay if their income was also in the neighborhood of $ 200,000 . Now what you want to know is : Can the debt ever be repaid ? And the simple answer is , \" yes , but you would n't really want to \" . Keeping our house metaphor in tact for the time being , if we wanted to get out of debt , we could pay less for the stuff we use and use the difference to pay down our debt . But there 's a problem : What do we cut ? Food ? Medicine ? Clothing ? Home Security ? Everything we 're spending money on we more or less need . Sure , we could nibble around the edges and find a few dollars here and there , but not enough to make a really big difference . Going back to our full scale US debt , it sounds good to say you 're going to cut our $ 10 million budget for ketchup research or $ 6 million in pork for a courthouse in Milwaukee , but that 's like saying you 're going to pay off your mortgage by rummaging around for spare change in your couch . When trillions are on the table , millions wo n't cut it and billions will barely touch it . Which is n't to say it 's impossible . Just about 20 years ago the Clinton administration had a plan to pay down the national debt by raising taxes and cutting spending . According to that plan , we would have paid off the national debt by the far off future year of 2011 . Unfortunately , when we went to war in Afghanistan and Iraq in 2002 and 2003 , that added expense sidelined the debt repayment and ballooned our debt . And then in 2008 and 2009 the financial crisis happened and various stimulus packages and tax relief packages meant our debt ballooned again . It 's really been a lousy decade for debt and deficit . But have no fear : Should we do the obvious yet politically suicidal thing of raising taxes and cutting spending we can get our debt under control again ( until the next big crisis , at least ) . But we do n't want to pay it off , mostly because a lot of our debt is n't owned by foreign countries : it 's owned by people like you and me in the form of government bonds . ( Basically you buy XX in IOUs from the government and they 'll pay you back XX plus interest after a given amount of time and these are generally seen as safe but low(er ) return parts of many investment portfolios for individuals and businesses . ) If the government is debt free , that means there are no bonds to invest in , which is n't very good for the economy . Economists might disagree on how much debt is good and how much is bad but most would agree that it 's best to have some . So that it . Our debt is big , but it 's not concerning because it 's about the same size as our GDP . It should probably be at least a little smaller , which is simple and hard because everyone knows what needs to be done ( higher taxes and lower spending ) but nobody is willing to do it . But much like needing to lose weight you ca n't just exercise more OR cut calories , you 've got to do both . And while we could one day , 20 , 30 years from now slowly get to zero with modest cuts and tax hikes , we do n't really need to or want to because it would mean lower , slower economic growth as a nation and fewer quality investment opportunities for individuals and businesses .",

      "The United States national debt is the total amount of money that the federal government owes to its creditors. The debt is currently about $28 trillion and it is possible for it to be repaid, but it would require the government to make regular payments to its creditors to reduce the balance. \nThere are a few ways that the government could make these payments: \n1. By running budget surpluses: This means that the government would bring in more money through taxes and other revenues than it spends on things like defense, education, and healthcare. The extra money could be used to pay down the debt. \n2. By selling assets: The government could sell things like land, buildings, or other assets to raise money to pay off the debt. \n3. By growing the economy: If the economy grows, the government will bring in more money through taxes, which could be used to pay down the debt. \nIt is important to note that the national debt is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it can be a useful tool for the government to fund important projects and stimulate the economy. However, if the debt gets too large, it can become difficult for the government to make the necessary payments, which could lead to financial problems.",

    "human_answer": [
      "1024x768 was a standard resolution for square aspect ratio monitors , so the 768 presumably comes from keeping that consistent and easily manufacturable . The 1366 is just brought about from the aspect ratio of widescreen 16:9 . Since DVDs were often widescreen it became a standard choice . There was a phase of 16:10 monitors for computers , mine for instance is 1680x1050 , but mass production wins out and the decision to use the same resolution across TVs , laptops and monitors drove the price down . That in turn meant other designers went with the lower cost screen ... becoming standard .",

      "The 1366x768 screen resolution became common on laptops because it is a good balance between image quality and the amount of processing power that is needed to display an image at that resolution. It is a common resolution for laptops because it provides enough detail for most tasks, such as web browsing and document editing, without requiring a lot of processing power. This means that laptops with 1366x768 screens can be more energy efficient, which is important for devices that are often used on the go. Additionally, 1366x768 is a common resolution for LCD panels, which are used in many laptop displays, so it is often easier and more cost-effective for manufacturers to use this resolution.",

If you want to know exactly where the insect is, you might try to shine a flashlight on it. But as soon as you shine the light on the insect, you change its momentum (because the light has energy, and when it hits the insect it gives some of that energy to the insect). So now you know where the insect is, but you don't know its momentum as well as you did before. On the other hand, if you don't shine any light on the insect, you might be able to figure out its momentum (for example, by clapping your hands and trying to chase it), but now you don't know its position as well as you did before. \nThe uncertainty principle tells us that there is always a trade-off between knowing the position and knowing the momentum of a particle.

      "Magnetic fields induce voltage into conductors ( like copper wire ) . To increase a magnetic field , one trick is to coil copper wire . The flow of electricity creates a magnetic field along the length of the wire , but it is relatively weak .

Certain materials are also used to further increase magnetism by allowing magnetic field lines to move . Like electricity , magnetic field flux lines move through materials differently . Magnetic field flow is called reluctance . Iron is very reluctant , and allows the magnet field lines to become stronger . Placing an iron core inside a coil increases the magnetic field strength , which increases the ability it has to induce voltage into a nearby copper conductor .

      "A transformer is a device that uses electricity to transfer energy from one circuit to another through a process called electrical induction. It does this by using coils of wire and a magnetic field. \nInside a transformer, there are two coils of wire called the primary coil and the secondary coil. The primary coil is connected to a source of electricity, such as a power outlet, and the secondary coil is connected to a device that needs electricity, such as a lamp. \nWhen electricity flows through the primary coil, it creates a magnetic field around the coil. This magnetic field then causes a current to flow in the secondary coil, which creates its own magnetic field. The two magnetic fields interact with each other, causing energy to be transferred from the primary coil to the secondary coil. \nThe amount of energy that is transferred depends on the number of coils in each of the primary and secondary coils. If the secondary coil has fewer coils than the primary coil, it will receive less energy, which means the voltage of the electricity in the secondary circuit will be lower than the voltage in the primary circuit. On the other hand, if the secondary coil has more coils than the primary coil, it will receive more energy, which means the voltage of the electricity in the secondary circuit will be higher than the voltage in the primary circuit. \nDoes this help to explain how a transformer works?",

    "question": "What s the difference between a theory and a law , and when does a theory become a law ? If convenient please add sources . ! Thanks ! Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "A theory never becomes a law . They are two different things . A law strictly states what has been observed , and makes no attempt to explain why it happens . Theories take a collection of observations , and based on the current evidence , come up with an explanation as to why those things happen .",
      "* * Scientific law * * - If X , then Y. A law simply is a way to predict , based on previous observations , how certain things interact . A law can be very limited in its application because you can only predict results if the circumstances are similar to the ones you measured . Laws do not attempt to explain * why * a certain thing occurs , just that it does . * * Scientific theory * * - If X , then Y , because Z. Scientific theories come up with an explanation for why certain things happen in certain circumstances . Theories have been tested , and can predict results which can then be tested . Some scientific theories take several laws and define the underlining principle that explains all these laws .",
      "In the scientific world , a law describes * * what * * happens , a theory attempts to formalise * * how * * or * * why * * it happens . So for example we have a Law of Gravity . Simple observation shows that objects always fall directly downwards . Newton 's Theory of Gravity attempts to put that on a mathematical basis , by saying that the objects are actually falling towards the centre of the earth ; furthermore he ( in a stroke of genius ) determines that the same force which pulls apples downwards from trees also governs the orbit of celestial objects , such as the earth around the sun . Einstein 's Theory of General Relativity goes even further and tries to explain the observed Law of Gravity in terms of the bending of space - time . So to answer the second part of your question , \" When does a theory become a law ? \" -- it does n't work like that in science . The law usually comes first , and then theories are later developed to try to explain the law ."

      "In science, a theory is a well-supported explanation for a set of observations or phenomena. A theory is not the same thing as a guess or a hunch. Instead, a theory is based on a lot of evidence and has been tested and refined over time. \nA law, on the other hand, is a statement that describes an observed pattern in nature. For example, the law of gravity states that objects with mass are attracted to each other. Like a theory, a law is based on evidence, but it is usually simpler and more straightforward than a theory. \nA theory can become a law if it is supported by a lot of evidence and is widely accepted by the scientific community. However, it is important to note that even a law can be changed or revised if new evidence is discovered that contradicts it. In science, it is important to always be open to new evidence and to be willing to change our understanding of the world based on that evidence. \nOverall, the main difference between a theory and a law is that a theory explains a set of observations, while a law describes an observed pattern. A theory can become a law if it is widely accepted and supported by a lot of evidence.",

      "Because smart , educated people are often very , very good at over - thinking things . They question everything . They do n't accept authority as the final word on anything . And they 're fantastic at coming up with \" logical \" justifications for purely emotional reactions . No one 's more susceptible to confirmation bias , than a person who is already very good at collecting and assembling data . This guy actually wrote a book about it : [ Smart People Believe Weird Things ] ( URL_0 ) As for how this relates to vaccines in particular ... Parents usually have a gut aversion to harming their own child . Giving a child a vaccine involves - at the very least ! - tears , fever , and a swollen arm . Parents need to be fairly committed to want to jab their kid with a needle in the first place . Now toss into the mix heart - wrenching stories of dead babies and disabled children , along with a soupcon of conspiracy theorizing ( Big Pharma , Big Brother ) , and a general fear of the unknown ( it 's not natural ! ) . And you 've got the perfect recipe for an educated anti - vaxxer . I completely understand where they 're coming from . When I got pregnant with my first child , I read everything I could get my hands on . I had to sort through solid science and crunchy granola pseudo science , and a General Arts degree really does n't equip you to do that well . There were so many questions ! Should I have my child in hospital , where I have access to better equipment and specialists but also a higher risk of iatrogenic infections , or do I have my child at home , where there 's less risk of infection but a higher chance I wo n't get immediate help if something goes wrong ? I compromised on a midwife - attended homebirth .

Yes . Welcome to the world , little girl , this wo n't be the most painful thing you experience in your life ! Do I have my son circumcised ? No , the benefits do n't seem compelling enough . And what about vaccination ? I have to admit I waffled at first . Some of the anti - vaxxers stories made me cry . I talked to my doctor and he said it was my decision . I went to a Public Health info session , and I listened , and then I looked around the room . There were a LOT of parents in there , swearing off vaccinating their kids . And I thought , \" Wow , there goes any hope of herd immunity . I 'd better get my kids vaccinated . \" Now , of course , I 'm a huge proponent of vaccination . I 've even started insisting the family get their flu shot every year , even though the last time I got it done it messed up my shoulder .

      "Assisted suicide and lethal injection are two different things. Assisted suicide refers to a situation where a person chooses to end their own life with the help of another person, usually a doctor, who provides the means for the person to do so. Lethal injection, on the other hand, is a method of execution used by some governments to carry out the death penalty on people who have been convicted of certain crimes. \nIn assisted suicide, the goal is to help a person who is suffering from a terminal illness or other severe medical condition to end their life in a peaceful and dignified manner. This can be done through the use of medication that the person takes themselves, or through other methods such as inhaling gases. The goal is to cause the person to fall asleep and then pass away peacefully, without experiencing any pain or suffering. \nLethal injection, on the other hand, is a method of execution that is intended to quickly and painlessly cause the death of the person being executed. It involves injecting the person with a combination of drugs that are designed to stop their heart and other vital functions.

One reason could be that these countries have larger populations, so there may simply be more people living there who are capable of committing crimes like this. Additionally, the United States and Canada may have more effective law enforcement and criminal justice systems, which may make it more likely for serial killers to be caught and their crimes to be properly investigated and reported on. \nIt's also possible that cultural and societal factors may play a role in the prevalence of serial killers in certain countries.

    "human_answer": [
      "It has to do with one - to - one correspondences . So for example , with every natural number we can relate exactly one even number , therefore we say the set of naturals and the set of even numbers have the same \" cardinality \" . This is true even thought the set of even numbers is a \" proper subset \" of the natural numbers . It can be shown , however , that there exists * no * one - to - one correspondence between the naturals and the real numbers , therefore their cardinalities differ . And also with every natural number you can relate * at least * one real number ( namely the number itself , e.g. 0 with 0 , 1 with 1 , etc . ) , so we say that the set of real numbers has greater cardinality than the set of natural numbers . What it is n't true is that you can relate every real number with a natural number . To get a better understanding I suggest you learn what an \" injection \" , a \" surjection \" , and a \" bijection \" is . ( A bijection is a function which is in a one - to - one correspondence .

      "In mathematics, there are different sizes of infinity, called \"cardinalities.\" The size of a set (a collection of objects) is referred to as its cardinality. For example, the set of all positive integers (1, 2, 3, 4, ...) has an infinite number of elements, so it has a cardinality of infinity. However, there are some sets that have a larger cardinality than others, even though they are both infinite. \nFor example, consider the set of all positive integers and the set of all fractions (numbers that can be written as a ratio of two integers, such as 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, etc.). Both sets are infinite, but there are more fractions than there are positive integers. To see why, think about the fact that for every integer, there is at least one corresponding fraction (for example, the integer 1 corresponds to the fraction 1/1, the integer 2 corresponds to the fraction 2/1, and so on). But there are also many fractions that do not correspond to any integer (for example, 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, etc.). Therefore, the set of fractions has a larger cardinality than the set of positive integers. \nThis may seem counterintuitive, because we usually think of larger numbers as being \"bigger\" than smaller numbers. However, when it comes to infinity, things work a little differently. It's not really accurate to say that one infinity is \"bigger\" than another, because infinity is not a number and it is not quantifiable in the same way that numbers are. Instead, we say that one set has a \"larger cardinality\" than another set to describe the fact that there are more elements in one set than in the other, even though both sets are infinite. \nI hope this helps!

So even though it was above your view , it was still right in front of you . Looking up and down was STILL a bit of a hack in early true 3D games . The math behind 2D and 3D games is called Linear Algebra . The coordinates are stored in a math entity called a matrix . There are a set of equations used to perform rotations around the axes , x , y , and z , that were / are popular , called Euler rotations . This is how the view can be used to look up , down , and side to side . The problem with Euler rotations is they can suffer something called \" gimble lock \" , where you get a divide by zero when you look straight up or down . The view gets stuck in this position and you ca n't turn away . The code either has to detect and recover from this by jerking you in some direction , or by preventing you from looking straight up or down to begin with . The problem is fixed by using quaternions to model rotations . You go through a 4th spacial dimension ( as a mathematical concept ) ."

      "In the original Doom game, the player character's gun was fixed in place and couldn't be aimed up or down. This was primarily because the game was designed to be played on a flat 2D plane, and the designers wanted to keep the gameplay simple and straightforward. \nOne of the key features of Doom was its fast-paced, frenetic gameplay, and allowing players to aim up and down would have added an extra layer of complexity that might have slowed the game down or made it more difficult to play. Additionally, the game's graphics and engine were not designed to accommodate player characters aiming up or down, so it would have been difficult or impossible to implement this feature without significant changes to the game. \nOverall, the decision to not allow players to aim up or down in Doom was likely a combination of design and technical limitations, and was made to keep the gameplay focused on fast-paced action and simple controls.",

The MAHLI camera has a very high-resolution lens, which allows it to take detailed close-up images of the rover's body and wheels. \nTo take a picture of itself, the rover first has to position its arm and camera in the right place. It does this by using sensors and motors to move the arm and adjust the camera's angle. \nOnce the arm and camera are in the right position, the rover sends a command to the MAHLI camera to take a picture. The camera then uses a flash to light up the scene and captures an image with its high-resolution lens. The image is then transmitted back to Earth, where scientists can analyze it and learn more about the rover and its environment on Mars. \nI hope this helps!

      "A strawman theory or strawman argument is a type of misrepresentation of an opposing position. It involves presenting a distorted or exaggerated version of someone's argument in order to make it easier to attack or refute. This can be done intentionally, in an attempt to deceive or mislead, or it can be done unintentionally, due to a lack of understanding or knowledge about the opposing position. \nFor example, imagine that there is a debate about whether or not to build a new highway through a particular region. One side of the argument might be in favor of building the highway, while the other side is opposed. If the side in favor of the highway presents a strawman argument, they might exaggerate or distort the arguments of the opposing side, making it seem like they are opposed to all forms of transportation or development, when in reality their objections may be more nuanced or limited in scope. This allows the side in favor of the highway to more easily attack or refute the opposing position, even though they have not accurately represented it. \nIt's important to be aware of strawman arguments and to try to avoid using them in discussions or debates. It's better to accurately represent the opposing position and engage with it on its own terms, rather than trying to deceive or mislead others by distorting it.",

      "When you have a cold, your throat may feel itchy because your body is trying to fight off the infection. When you're sick, your immune system kicks into gear and works to rid your body of the virus or bacteria that is causing the illness. One way that your body does this is by producing more mucus. Mucus is a thick, sticky substance that helps to trap and remove germs from your body. \nWhen you have a cold, your body may produce more mucus than usual, and this can make your throat feel itchy. The extra mucus can also cause your throat to feel sore or scratchy. \nIn addition to mucus, your body may also produce more saliva when you're sick. Saliva is a watery substance that helps to keep your mouth and throat moist. When you have a cold, you may produce more saliva than usual, which can also make your throat feel itchy. \nIt's also possible that the itchy feeling in your throat is caused by irritation from coughing or sneezing. When you cough or sneeze, the muscles in your throat and chest contract, which can cause your throat to feel itchy. \nOverall, the itchy feeling in your throat when you have a cold is caused by a combination of factors, including an increase in mucus and saliva production, as well as irritation from coughing or sneezing.",

When government does happen in the colonies it tends to be small and local not driven from overseas . Then the French and Indian War happens . Britain spends an extraordinary amount of money protecting the colonists from their enemies . Those colonists are developing larger and larger towns and cities and expect the Crown to protect them not just do it themselves any more . The frontier mentality is being lost in the cities and towns . In response after the war the British government does several things which basically pisses off every colonist possible . First they establish the Proclamation line of 1763 . No settlement west of the Appalachians , that is now reserved for the Indians . No more running from the authorities by going west . And as the colonist see it setting up a place the Indians can gather and prepare to attack them in peace . This pisses of all the frontier minded people , and all those who chafe under government control . Second they decide its time the colonists paid for some of the defense that has already been provided in the war , and will be provided in the future . They impose various taxes on goods : The Tea Act , The Stamp Act and restrictions on how trade is conducted . This pisses off the merchants in the cities and those who in the past would flee west ca n't anymore and stay in the east as dissenters . Third the colonists are given no say in these policies . Not only will the government in England impose unwanted regulations you do n't get a vote or even the right to complain . That privilege is reserved for people in Great Britain . Now as dissent and unrest increase the British use the army now stationed in the colonies to stop it . They send out raids into the countryside to seize guns and powder . They garrison the worst of the cities not paying the taxes , and they impose more taxes to pay for this further angering the colonists . Its a downward spiral . The more the colonists resit the stronger the British clamp down which causes the colonists to resit more . All the while the British do n't even consider letting the colonists have a say in determining real policy for the colonies . In truth the taxes were not that bad . They were less than someone in GB could be expected to pay .

      "Football and Basketball are not free . You just have basic cable at the very least which makes you think it 's free . You still pay for it in the same way that CNN or ESPN are not * free * . The reason you get NFL and NBA on TV is because FOX / ABC / NBC / CBS / ESPN pay a combined $ 20 billion to televise the NFL . ESPN / TNT / ABC pay a combined $ 2.6 billion for the NBA plus all of the local contracts ( some are quite lucrative like in LA or NYC ) . Boxing and MMA do n't have contracts with those stations ( mainly because they are considered worth it for the major stations ) so they do PPV . The benefit of PPV is that you can charge more PER PERSON than the NFL or NBA does however you also can not build out your audience the same way that the big 4 sports can . This is because any random bored person can look on their TV ( most Americans have at least basic cable ) and turn on a random NBA game on ESPN * for free * ( I 'm using that again relative to how they already pay for cable so it 's technically free like you said ) . No random person who does n't like boxing or MMA will pay to watch a bout . One other factor is the commercials . One reason the big 3 in America ( NFL , MLB , and NBA ) are the top sports is because they fit the American model for a TV show . 5 - 10 minutes of action and then 2 - 3 minute commercial breaks . As we all know the NFL is the king of this as they go to commercial after every change of possession ( sometimes twice like on a kickoff ) . This results in tons of commercialization of the game . The NBA is similar since there are so many timeouts and the MLB is predictable with its innings so it can go to commercial multiple times . The NHL is n't as popular in the USA . This is somewhat a result of the lack of commercials like in soccer which also has not caught on in America . Boxing and MMA do not fit the American model of a commercial sport ."

    "human_answer": [
      "+1 is the international country code for the US and Canada . As long as you 're not actually making an international call it 's unnecessary .",
      "That 1 is the [ country code ] ( URL_0 ) for North America . It 's been part of dialing for decades . In the old days , you used to just dial 7 digits ( 555 - 1234 ) and it assumed you were calling something local ( in your area code ) . Calling outside your area code required 1 + area code + 7 digits ( e.g. 1 - 555 - 5555 ) . After a while , that fell apart . As cities grew larger & people started getting multiple numbers ( fax lines , cell phones , etc ) we did n't have enough room in an area code for all the people that were actually \" local \" to each other . We switched to mandatory 10 - digit dialing for even local calls . These days , many people have cell phones that are n't \" local \" to where they 're living so they ca n't do naked 10 - digit dialing of \" local \" calls . It 's always been there , people are just writing it down more frequently . If you look at numbers in Europe , people almost * always * write down the country code with their numbers . For example , the Conde Nast European office is listed as * * +44 20 7499 9080 * * but UK callers wo n't need the 44 .",
      "The reason for the 1 is that the phone system needs to know when you 're finished dialing based only on the numbers you 've dialed so far . If you start with some number other than 1 , then it knows you 're dialing only seven digits . If it starts with 1 , then it knows that you 're dialing ten more digits , so it does n't start trying to connect the call after the first seven . This is n't an issue with cell phones , where you send the whole number in at once , but older phones it would send each digit to the phone system as you dialed or pressed the digit ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "The 1 in front of phone numbers is called a country code, and it is used to identify which country a phone number belongs to. This is especially important when making international phone calls, because it helps the phone system route the call to the correct country. \nThe use of country codes for phone numbers started when telephone systems were first developed in the late 1800s and early 1900s. At that time, each country had its own telephone system, and it was important to be able to distinguish between different countries when making phone calls. The 1 in front of phone numbers in the United States is the country code for the United States, and it is used to identify phone numbers in the United States when making international phone calls. \nThe country code is typically followed by an area code, which is used to identify a specific region or city within a country. The area code is followed by the local phone number, which is used to identify a specific phone line within a region or city. For example, if you want to call a phone number in the United States, you would dial 1 (the country code for the United States), followed by the area code (which might be something like 212 for New York City), followed by the local phone number (which might be something like 555-1212). \nI hope that helps!

    "human_answer": [
      "Some recovering drug addicts do drink alcohol without abusing it . Though , the statistics seem to say that most recovering addicts can not drink alcohol without also abusing it . Most recovery programs teach that if you are an addict to once substance , you have the increased likelihood to abuse other addictive substances . As such , their advice is to avoid those substances in general . The deal with nicotine ( smoking tobacco ) is this ... while it is definitely addictive , its effects are not socially destructive , as the effects of alcohol , or cocaine , or heroin ( or whatever ) . Nicotine definitely is hazardous to one 's health ( and even to others in the form of second - hand smoke ) , but its effects are mostly personal and take a relatively long time to show up . It is unlikely that no matter how many tobacco cigarettes one smokes , you are not going to be so intoxicated that while driving you will cause an accident resulting in the injury or deaths of other people .",

    "generated_answer": [
      "Recovering drug addicts may not be able to have alcohol because it can interfere with their recovery and increase the risk of relapse. Alcohol is a psychoactive substance that can alter mood and behavior, and it can be particularly dangerous for people who are in recovery from drug addiction because it can trigger cravings and lead to a return to drug use. \nAdditionally, many people who struggle with drug addiction also struggle with alcohol addiction, or they may have a co-occurring disorder such as alcohol use disorder. In these cases, quitting both drugs and alcohol is necessary for successful recovery. \nAs for smoking cigarettes, while it is not strictly prohibited for recovering drug addicts, it is generally not recommended because smoking can also have negative health consequences and may be a trigger for drug or alcohol use. Additionally, smoking can interfere with the recovery process by causing problems with breathing, which can make it more difficult to participate in physical activities or therapies that may be part of the recovery process.",

    "human_answer": [
      "Some people have genuine reasons for \" prepping \" ( e.g. they 've had relatives in areas where hurricanes have hit and seen how little outside help was provided to these people / they live on fault lines where there is a high chance of an earthquake taking out the power grid / they live in an issolated area ) whereas others are basically deranged conspiracy theorists and then there are others that simply do it as a hobby that allows them to meet up with new people and learn some valuable skills ( e.g. first aid / hunting etc ) .",
      "Do n't believe the hyped up media and TV shows about prepping . \" Doomsday Preppers \" and the like are TV shows . They are n't reality any more than Survivor is about how to actually survive stranded on an island . Dealing with an apocalypse is only the tiniest fraction of what Prepping is really about . Prepping is simply being prepared . Life does n't always go your way . The things you rely on to always be there for you are not always there . Ask the people who went for days without water , power , food or shelter in Hurricane Sandy . Or the massive power outage in 2003 . Or any number of tornadoes , blizzards , riots , etc that people have to deal with . We are taught to always rely on others . Clean running water will always come out of the tap . Plug your phone into the wall and it will always charge . The grocery stores will always have as much food as you want . Gas stations will always have full tanks you can just pull up and use . Police will always respond to that guy kicking down your door . Except people find out all the time that \" always \" is n't really true . Those systems we rely on lull us into a false sense of security . We stop learning to do anything ourselves or have any kind of backup in place . You get so used to the light switch always working , 911 always answering , and the grocery store always having plenty of food and water that you forget that sometimes it does n't work out that way . And a lot of people paid the price for it . Hurricane Sandy was n't that long ago . And the pain and suffering did n't stop when the rain and when did . People got dehydrated . People got sick . Some of them died . Do you want to be that guy who has to tell his 7yo daughter that there 's no water to drink because all the tap water is contaminated with sewage ? Do you want to tell your son that you ca n't buy any more asthma medication for him because there is n't any more ? The good news is you 're probably already a Prepper in some way and you do n't even know it . Why do you wear a seat belt when police always catch people before they cause accidents ? Just in case they do n't . Why do you have smoke detectors or a fire extinguisher when the Fire Dept will always arrive to put out a fire before it 's dangerous ? Just in case they do n't . Preppring is n't a million rounds of ammo , a pallet of MREs and a bomb shelter . Prepping is having spare batteries and flashlights for a blackout . Prepping is having a few cases of water in case they go scarce for a while ( like during Sandy , Katrina , riots , contaminated water tables , etc ) . Prepping is simply asking yourself \" What things do I always seem to get from somewhere else ? What would happen if I could n't get it from that place for a day , a week , a month ? \" What do you do when you do n't have power for 5 days ? What do you do when gas prices spike and there 's lines at the pump ? What do you do when you 're stranded on the side of the road in the winter and your cell phone does n't have signal ? What do you do when there 's some kind of demonstration / protest / riot a few blocks away from where you and your children sleep ? What do you do when you see an alert on the news that your tap water wo n't be safe to drink for a week ? What do you do when you call 911 and they say they ca n't have police / fire / ems out to you for a few hours ? Answer those questions . That 's Prepping . No matter what some trumped up sensationalized TV bullshit tells you .",

      "Prepping, also known as \"survivalism,\" refers to the practice of preparing for emergencies or disasters. Some people are into prepping because they believe it is important to be self-sufficient and able to take care of themselves and their loved ones in the event of a crisis. This could be a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or earthquake, or a man-made disaster, such as a financial collapse or cyber attack. \nPeople who are into prepping often stockpile supplies, such as food, water, and medical supplies, and may also learn skills like first aid or how to start a fire without matches. They may also have backup plans in place, such as a safe place to go or a way to communicate with others if regular means of communication are disrupted. \nWhile it is true that the government is not likely to collapse anytime soon, disasters and emergencies can happen at any time and being prepared can help people cope with the challenges they may face. It is important to note that prepping does not necessarily mean expecting the worst to happen, but rather being prepared for a range of possible outcomes.",

When a dog gives birth to puppies, they will typically become very protective of them and will work to keep them safe and fed. \nHowever, it is also possible for dogs to understand that the puppies are their own in a more cognitive sense.

    "question": "What is the purpose of a water tower ? Backup storage ? Pressure management ? Hopefully a public works person can explain ... Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "It 's backup storage that does n't require power to redistribute . The weight of the stored water provides enough force to distribute the water from the tower to the grid if necessary .",
      "It is for water pressure , so when you turn on a faucet located below the tower , water comes out . It 's also important for the entire water system to be pressurized so that when pipes leak , it 's mostly clean water leaking out and not dirty water leaking in . There is a little bit of a backup component in that water will still flow and the pipes will remain pressurized in the event of a power outage until water in the tower is depleted .",
      "As the others have stated , it 's for water pressure , but it 's also for efficiency . Using a water tower , you need a pump capable of lifting a day 's worth of water in a day , rather than following the demand curves . Well , you need more capacity for reserve . so it needs to be capable of pumping more than a day 's worth of water per day . This means you can use a fairly efficient single - speed pump , as opposed to needing a less efficient variable - speed pump that needs to pump more at times of higher demand and less at times of lower demand . So using a water tower will be cheaper overall than just using pumps to keep the system pressurized . Plus there 's the added benefit of not needing nearly as robust a backup power source , since the pressure in the system wo n't go down just because there 's a temporary power outage ."

    "generated_answer": [
      "A water tower is a tall, cylindrical tank that is used to store water. It is usually found in areas where the water pressure in the local water pipes is not strong enough to deliver water to buildings and homes. \nThe water tower helps to solve this problem by storing a large amount of water at a higher elevation than the buildings and homes. This allows the water to flow downward, through the pipes, and into the buildings and homes under the force of gravity. This is called \"gravity feed.\" \nWater towers also help to maintain a consistent water pressure in the pipes. When a lot of water is being used at the same time (for example, when people are taking showers or flushing toilets), the water pressure can drop. Having a water tower helps to ensure that there is always a reserve of water available to meet the demand, so the water pressure stays stable. \nIn summary, water towers are used to store water and to help with the delivery of water to buildings and homes, as well as to maintain a consistent water pressure in the pipes.",

To make sure everything runs smoothly and safely, the airport has a carefully planned system for when and where planes can take off and land. \nWhen a plane is ready to take off, it will line up on the runway and wait for permission to go. When it is safe for the plane to take off, the airport control tower will give it permission to do so. The plane will then accelerate down the runway and lift off into the air. \nWhen a plane is ready to land, it will approach the airport and line up with one of the runways. The control tower will give the plane permission to land, and the pilot will bring the plane down gently onto the runway. \nAlthough London Heathrow only has two main runways, it has a number of other smaller runways that can also be used if needed.

So when you're near a bathroom and you really need to go, it might be harder to hold it in than when you're not near a bathroom and the signal to go is weaker. \nI hope that helps!

    "human_answer": [
      "Manufacturers can enforce something called a \" minimum advertised price \" on their products through contracts with retailers . Basically , the retailers have to sign a contract that says they ca n't advertise the product below a certain price . Manufacturer 's do this to ensure that their products sell at a certain price . It 's particularly important for manufacturer 's who also do retail , like Apple . Apple wants to sell iPhones in its stores for a certain price and wants other stores to sell iPhones as well , but not at a lower price . However , this only affects the advertised price . You can still sell the item for less as long as you do n't advertise the lower price . When you click the item to put it in your cart , you can see the price because it 's not longer an advertised price ; it 's the price you 're about the be charged .",
      "The manufacturers have agreements with retailers - including Amazon - that say that the item ca n't be advertised below a certain price . The receiver in that article , for example , has a retail price of $ 600 . Onkyo may have as part of their sales contract that it ca n't be advertised for less than $ 550 . Amazon has a lot of buying power , though , and the wholesale cost might only be $ 350 , so they 've decided that it makes more sense to sell it for $ 425 or something . They are still making a profit on the item , so they are happy . But their agreement with Onkyo means they ca n't list it for that price , because that would constitute advertising . If it was a brick - and - mortar store , there would be a sign saying \" ask for price \" ; the online equivalent to asking for the price is adding it to your cart . If you are n't ready to buy at that price , you can remove it from the cart and choose something else .",

To encourage customers to add more items to their cart: By hiding the price until the item is added to the cart, the website may be trying to encourage customers to add more items to their cart before they see the total cost. This can be especially effective if the website offers discounts for larger orders. \n2. To reduce comparison shopping: By hiding the price until the item is added to the cart, the website may be trying to make it more difficult for customers to compare the price of the product with prices offered by other websites. This can be especially effective if the website has a unique or hard-to-find product that is not available elsewhere. \n3. To create a sense of exclusivity: Some websites may hide the price of a product until it is added to the cart as a way of creating a sense of exclusivity or scarcity.

      "The Mona Lisa is considered a masterpiece of Renaissance art because of the skill and technique used by the artist, Leonardo da Vinci, to create the painting. The Mona Lisa is a portrait of a woman and is known for the enigmatic smile on her face, which is one of the reasons it is so famous. \nOne of the things that makes the Mona Lisa so special is the way Leonardo painted the woman's face and expression. He used a technique called sfumato, which involves blending the colors and tones of the paint so that there are no hard edges or lines. This gives the painting a very soft and natural look, as if the woman is almost alive. \nAnother reason the Mona Lisa is so highly regarded is because of the detail and care that Leonardo put into the painting. He spent many years working on the Mona Lisa, and it shows in the level of detail in the painting. From the folds of the woman's dress to the landscape in the background, everything is carefully and beautifully rendered. \nOverall, the Mona Lisa is considered a masterpiece because of the skill and attention to detail that Leonardo put into the painting, as well as the way he used color and technique to create a sense of depth and realism.

    "question": "How do herbivores like wild horses acquire so much muscle mass just by feeding on grass ? Can a vegan human maintain high muscle mass just by feeding on herbs ? and if no why not ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Horses are naturally herbivores . There is protein in what they eat , although the protein density is low , so they have to eat a lot of it . The digestive tract of an herbivore is different from a human 's , allowing them to process that volume of plant matter quickly and without using much energy , and also getting nutrients from it that human 's ca n't . For a vegan human to have a lot of muscle mass is possible , but more difficult . Mainly , they have to focus on eating high protein plants like nuts and beans .",
      "Different species are able to synthesize different nutrients themselves through cellular processes . Nutrients include carbohydrates , fats , proteins ( or their building blocks , amino acids ) , and vitamins . This means instead of the body having to \" eat \" the protein containing a particular amino acid , the cell itself can make that amnio acid . This of course requires energy and work by the cell . Conversely , \" a nutrient is said to be \" essential \" if it must be obtained from an external source , either because the organism can not synthesize it or produces insufficient quantities \" . So there are two kinds of nutrients , those that we can make through our own cellular processes , and those we must obtain through our diet . [ Proteins ] ( URL_2 ) are made up of different [ amnio acids ] ( URL_3 ) . A good analogy is that a protein is like a train , and the individual cars are amnio - acids . Different combinations of railcars , in different orders give different kinds of trains . In the same way , different amnio - acids , in different combinations give different kinds of proteins . Digestion , be it in animals or humans , results in the breakdown proteins into their amnio acid components . The intestine absorbs the individual amnio acids and the body ships these amnio acids to the cells . Cellular processes rearrange the amnio acids in new ways to make new proteins that are used by the animal or human for various bodily functions . So think of the cell as the railyard where new trains ( proteins ) are made but reassembling the cars ( amnio - acids ) into new and different combinations . \" Proteins perform a vast array of functions within living organisms , including catalyzing metabolic reactions , replicating DNA , responding to stimuli , and transporting molecules from one location to another . \" There are [ nine essential amino acids ] ( URL_1 ) that humans must consume in their diet because our cells can not make them through cellular processes . The rest we can make ourselves in our cells . This means that our diet must meet these minimum essential amnio acids requirements in order for us to survive . We can not make the nine , we must consume the nine . The nine are found in all kinds of foods , from plants to meat which is why humans can have such a wide variety of diets ( e.g. vegetarian , vegan , allergen - accomidating ) and still function normally . However , other animals have different essential nutritional requirements . For example , [ cats , unlike humans , can not synthesize the amino acid taurine so it must be added to their diet ] ( URL_0 ) . Some species are able to synthesize Vitamin C and do not need to consume it in their diet ( e.g. mice ) , whereas humans can not synthesize Vitamin C and thus are required to consume it in our diet . These differences in essential nutrient intake creates different dietary requirements for different species and results in different types of foods being consumed preferentially by different species . This is why a horse is able to survive and thrive just on plant material , whereas we are required to consume a more varied diet . They obtain all their unique essential nutrients from their herbivore diet . So other species have different combinations of essential nutrients in order to sustain a balanced and healthy diet . This makes perfect sense , if all species had the exact same requirements there would be a lot of competition for the same food resources . By diversifying what is essential to consume , there is less competition . Remember that it is costly for the body to produce its own nutrients through cellular processes . It is much easier to just consume an amnio acid than produce it . Thus , if a particular amino acid or nutrient is abundant and easily available in a species environment it makes more sense for natural selection to select against the cell 's producing that nutrient , and for the individual to simply consume it . For example , most primates - including humans - do not synthesize vitamin C. This makes perfect sense since vitamin C is easily acquired through our collective diets by consuming fruit . Fruit is abundant resource in most primate 's environments thus vitamin C would not be hard to acquire . So each species is balancing what they need to eat , and what they can produce themselves , along with what is available to them in their environment .",
      "Herbivores have multiple stomachs with different enzymes that allow them to extract nutrition from fiber . Humans do not . Plus herbivores eat for up to half their lives , chomping on uncooked grasses and such . They did a test where some humans were given a diet equivalent to a gorilla , for a week . They spent ~8 hours chomping on raw vegetables , and by the end they were lethargic and malnourished . The human body simply ca n't sustain itself on raw vegetables . We evolved through cooking an omnivorous diet ."

    "generated_answer": [
      "Herbivores like wild horses can acquire a lot of muscle mass by eating a lot of grass because grass contains a good amount of nutrients that the body needs to grow and maintain muscle mass. These nutrients include proteins, which are important for building and repairing muscle tissue, and carbohydrates, which provide the body with energy to support physical activity. \nIt is possible for a vegan human to maintain high muscle mass by eating a varied and balanced diet that includes a good source of plant-based proteins and carbohydrates. Some examples of plant-based proteins that can help build and maintain muscle mass include beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh, nuts, and seeds. It is also important for vegans to make sure they are getting enough calories and nutrients from other sources, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, to support muscle growth and maintenance. \nHowever, it is generally easier for people who eat animal products, such as meat, eggs, and dairy, to get enough protein and other nutrients to support muscle mass because these sources of protein are typically more easily digestible and contain a more complete set of amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein. This does not mean that it is impossible for vegans to maintain high muscle mass, but it may require more careful planning and attention to nutrition.",

The way the industry works is an artist is contracted to produce content for the publisher , they do n't own their own songs , and they 're literally lucky if they get any money , at all , from the sale of their media . Artists make money by performing , and even then , they 're responsible for the cost of the production , which cuts into their profits . So publishers are seen as big , bad , rich , faceless corporations - profiteering gluttons who do n't need any more money for something they own but they did n't make , so fuck em ' , right ? The world is such a big place and so many people do buy the album that they wo n't even notice I stole a copy ... Or so the mindset goes . There are scenarios where people do pay , when they feel the price is fair and when they feel the profits are distributed to those whom they see entitled .",

Media companies have come around , and now you can get just about any content in digital format . However , many people who grew up in the \" piracy or nothing \" era feel entitled to \" free \" media , and this attitude has been adopted as a convenient way for other people to not feel bad about pirating content .",

      "Piracy and copyright law can be contentious issues on the internet because they involve complex questions about how to balance the rights of creators and the interests of consumers. Some people argue that artists should have the right to control how their works are distributed and to charge what they feel is appropriate, while others believe that the free exchange of information is important and that artists should not be able to control how their works are used. \nIt's important to remember that copyright law exists to protect the rights of creators and to encourage the creation of new works by ensuring that artists can earn a fair income from their creations. When someone pirates (unauthorized copying) or uses a copyrighted work without permission, they are taking something that belongs to someone else and using it for their own benefit, without paying the person who created it. This can be seen as unfair to the creator and can discourage them from creating new works in the future. \nAt the same time, it's also important to recognize that not everyone has the same access to information and that copyright laws can sometimes make it difficult or impossible for people to access the works they want to use. This is why it's important to have a balance between protecting the rights of creators and ensuring that everyone has access to the information and works they need.",

      "There are a few reasons why individuals involved in the CIA's torture program have not been charged in international court for crimes against humanity. \nFirst, it is important to note that the United States is not a party to the International Criminal Court (ICC), which is the main international tribunal that prosecutes crimes against humanity. This means that the ICC does not have jurisdiction over individuals in the United States, and cannot bring criminal charges against them. \nSecond, even if the United States were a party to the ICC, it is generally difficult to prosecute individuals for crimes against humanity. These crimes are typically committed on a large scale, such as during armed conflicts or genocides, and require evidence of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population. Proving that an individual was directly responsible for such crimes can be challenging, especially when there are many people involved and the events in question took place over a long period of time. \nFinally, it is also worth noting that the United States has its own legal system and processes for holding individuals accountable for their actions. While it is true that the Obama Administration chose not to pursue criminal charges against individuals involved in the CIA's torture program, this decision was made in part because the Department of Justice had already investigated the matter and determined that there was not enough evidence to bring criminal charges.",

    "human_answer": [
      "It is a theoretical model , that has been proven through experiment . Imagine someone gives you a gift . It is a hollow metal sphere but it is packaged in a box . You have no idea what the gift is , but decide to do some experiments to find out , without actually opening the box . First you shake the box and it moves around . This tells you it is relatively light . Then , knowing that it is light , you move it slowly and you feel it rolling . This tells you that it is probably round . Now you are trying to find out what it is made of . You apply heat to the box , then shake to see if it has melted but it has not . You suspect that it is a strong but light material , like a metal alloy - since initial shake tests did n't break it ca n't be brittle . So you decide to touch magnets to the surface of the box . The object does not move and stays attracted to the magnet . This tells you it is metallic . Since it is metallic and relatively light , you suspect , it is hollow . So , you poke a hole in the box , and fill it with water . Comparing the volume of the box , with the volume of water you filled will tell you the size of the object . From this , you can choose a metal - alloy based on the magnetic strength recorded and estimate how hollow it is . All this has been concluded , without actually seeing the sphere . Still , you can only speculate what colour the sphere is or whether it has dimples or not . But from the tests you carried out , you can pretty much acknowledge certain findings as fact . That 's sort of the process people like Rutherford used to determine the atomic model . As for being able to see it , I do n't think so . We have two types of microscope - Light microscope and Electron microscope . LM uses lightwaves ( duh ) and so objects too small to interfere with these waves can not be seen . EM uses electrons ( of course ) , which which are very tiny , and they bounce back of the object at different angles to give us awesome 3d images . I do n't need to tell you what would happen if we tried to fire electrons at an atom ... but that 's beside the point . The Rutherford experiments already did that , and it told us that materials are mostly empty space and there is much distance between the nucleus and an electron .

      "I would say that it is pandemic as opposed to being epidemic , that is , it is n't just happening in NYC or Ferguson or Chicago . While the vast majority of police officers in every department are not guilty of brutality or even of looking the other way , it is , and has been , happening in isolated cases across the country . Further , it also seems to be indicative of police deference and entitlement . Little things like officers not following departmental protocols time and time again after reported incidents of the use of extreme force ( e.g. not getting / recording post - incident interviews , failing to collect evidence ) without action taken by the chief or a political system have led to people simply losing faith in the police . Many feel that the entitlement is so rampant that the officers ca n't be trusted as they once were . It goes deeper than this too . There is a very real and deeply seated distrust between non - whites ( and sympathetic / empathetic whites ) and the justice system . Exacerbated by a failed war on drugs and the still tender wounds of the civil rights movement . ( That 's my explanation of the Police side of the issue but , like everything , there are two sides here ) As mentioned above , ours is a generation born of several decades of political strife , or at least our privileged \" first world problems \" version of it . From Vietnam and the Civil Rights movement to Rodney King and Katrina , you could say that protest and civil disobedience is in our blood . This has led to a public refusal to capitulate to authority and , for many , the automatic assumption that those with power are disinterested in the common good or even actively opressive . Law enforcement agencies , as a result , feel they are now in an arms race of sorts . Additional firepower and more agressive tactics have been , they feel , necessitated by a progressively more uncooperative ( and often better armed ) public . This in turn reenforces the public 's notions of opression . ( That is my ELI5 of the situation , the rest is my personal opinion on it ) You will hear often ( in fact a couple comments here reference it ) that these incidents are so infrequent that they hardly deserve attention , the current furor being nothing more than the direct result of news media sensationalization . Worse , you will hear people arguing that Police are people too , they make mistakes and we have to be able to forgive and forget . These ideas are ignorant and ineffectual at best and dishonest and dangerous at worst . We hold our police officers up to be the beacons of justice in this country . Undoubtedly it is a high standard perhaps unachievable but law enforcement is the tool through which we shape a better more idealized society . I firmly believe that we are only ever as righteous as the least righteous amongst us . Police departments have a responsibility to weed out the offending officers . Instead they too often close ranks , look the other way or simply ignore the issue . There is an unfair level of distrust from the public but unfortunately that is not going to change over night . We are many and old grudges die hard , even ill - informed ones . If , however , Law Enforcement decides to take it upon themselves to address the public 's concerns we could arrive at a better level of safety and mutual respect within a couple decades at most .

A processor with a higher clock speed will generally be able to perform tasks faster than a processor with a lower clock speed. \nSo, a dual-core processor that runs at 4 GHz and a 6-core processor that runs at 4 GHz will have different performance capabilities. The 6-core processor will generally be able to perform tasks faster and more efficiently than the dual-core processor, because it has more cores that can work on different tasks at the same time. \nFor example, if you are running multiple programs on your computer at the same time, the 6-core processor will be able to split the work among its cores and complete the tasks faster than the dual-core processor, which can only work on one task at a time. \nI hope that helps!

With nuclear energy, it can be difficult to accurately control the amount of energy that is released, which can make it difficult to use as a fuel source for space travel. \nFinally, there are also concerns about the environmental impact of using nuclear energy for space travel. Nuclear reactions can produce radioactive waste, which would need to be carefully disposed of in order to protect the environment. \nOverall, while nuclear energy has the potential to be a very efficient and powerful fuel source, the practical and technical challenges associated with using it for space travel make it less suitable for use in rockets and other spacecraft.",

      "you freeze the air until it liquefies , the slowly warm it up again and distill off the different fractions as they vaporize .",
      "The process is called fractional distillation . Because everything in air has different boiling points ( i.e. helium 's boiling point is -270 degrees C ) you can cool the gases and as each temperature is reached , the gas will liquefy and can be removed , until helium is reached and is liquefied . I hope it helps :)",
      "In the case of helium , most of it comes from underground natural gas wells . It gets produced by radioactive minerals that undergo alpha decay - alpha particles being the same as helium nuclei , they just need to pick up some electrons to become helium atoms . For everything else , they get produced by liquefying air and separating out the different gases . Some noble gases are present in very low concentrations in the atmosphere , making them difficult and expensive to extract ."

      "Sure! Gases like helium are collected and put into containers in a process called gas collecting. Here's how it works: \n1. First, helium gas is found in the Earth's crust, often in natural gas deposits. \n2. To collect the gas, workers drill into the ground to find the natural gas deposits and extract the gas using special equipment. \n3. Once the gas is extracted, it is purified to remove any impurities or contaminants. \n4. Next, the purified gas is put into a special container called a \"gas cylinder\" or \"gas tank.\" These containers are made of metal and are designed to hold gases safely. \n5. The gas is then sealed inside the container using a special valve or other closing mechanism. \nThat's it! Now the gas is ready to be used or transported to where it is needed. Hope that helps!

    "question": "Why do online videos stream flawlessly on my computer but why do GIFs seem to load like a 1080p movie through a 56k modem ? ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "tl;dr : GIF is an image compression format , which is n't really suited well to compressing video data . Basically the only advantage is that browsers support the format natively without loading plugins . Actual videos compressed with video encoders are way more efficient . --- In an animated GIF , each frame of the animation is encoded as a separate file , and then the files are more or less just stuck together in the final animation . You can do something similar with JPEG ( Motion JPEG ) , although it 's not supported by browsers in quite the same way as GIFs . Also GIFs do a better job of compressing line art rather than photographs . Thus , making a video out of GIF images yields pretty poor compression anyhow . In an encoded video file , the video compressor takes into account that successive frames are ( probably ) related to each other . The first frame is encoded completely , in a similar ( but more advanced ) method as a JPEG might be . However , the next frame is typically encoded as just the difference from the first frame to the second . This is way more efficient for most videos where motion happens slowly . Say the video is of a ball falling . In an animated GIF , each frame is a standalone , complete picture of the ball and any surroundings . It 's compressed rather poorly , and a lot of redundant information is sent , so each individual frame is very large . In a video encoded with a video codec ( MPEG1 , MPEG2 , MPEG4 , h.264 , h,265 , etc ) , the first frame is compressed somewhat similarly to a JPEG . Then the second frame basically says \" see the region of the first frame where the ball is ? Move that down a bit . Fill in the background with this information . \" - This frame is * way * smaller and easier to transmit than the first frame . It 's also easier and faster to decode . There are some drawbacks to the video compression approach , but in general it does a way better job of representing the video data with way fewer bits . --- EDIT : Wow , this is getting a lot of attention :) I left out a lot of stuff to keep the answer simple , but I 'm getting pinged about a lot of the same things over and over , so here 's a few quick additions : - Yes , compression algorithm differences matter as well . I said something to this effect , but to extend : GIF uses a compression method that works well for color patterns , and video encoders use something that works better for photographs / live video . I did n't try to explain DCT / Quantization / entropy coding since that 's a super technical topic for ELI5 . - Yes , GIF can represent a simple delta between two frames . However , in the case of video data , it is rare that this is useful . Someone asked for a more detailed explanation of this , [ my response is here ] ( URL_1 ) . - Yes , there may be other factors at work besides the bitrate / coding issues . I think it is safe to say that GIF is a terrible video compression format , and that 's probably the root of many other issues . However , I have n't profiled browsers to see where they spend time decoding animated GIFs . I made a list of other places that could be inefficient [ here ] ( URL_0 ) . - Yeah , your \" five year old did n't understand this \" el - oh - el :P If my 7 - yr - old had the interest I 'd try to explain it to him and get his feedback , but I think he 'd rather play LEGO . --- EDIT 2 : A couple more things people are asking / mentioning : - Several people have mentioned HTML5 Video and WebM as alternatives to animated GIFs . There 's a lot of back - and - forth , legal issues , competitors refusing to agree and so forth that is really hampering the HTML5 video tag . [ Wikipedia has a long article on the subject . ] ( URL_2 ) We 've had better video technology than GIF for years and GIF is still going strong . I think we 're stuck with it , despite it being a terrible technology for the problem . ( See also : practically every other technology used on the web ) - A common question is \" So does this mean that simpler videos with less movement will be encoded to smaller file sizes ? Or that complex or really random videos make larger or less efficient video files ? \" The answer to this somewhat depends on the encoder settings , but in general the answer is yes . If you encode a simple video with little motion it will take less data than a more complex video with a lot of motion and random stuff going on . Modern video encoders are tuned towards encoding video sequences from cameras . They make assumptions based on what the real world looks like most of the time , and use those assumptions to compress more efficiently . They also take into account what our eyes are good at seeing .",
      "Short answer : videos use better compression techniques than GIFs . GIF was originally designed as a still image format , with the animation capability kind of shoehorned in later . Video uses compression techniques that were designed specifically for video . This means the file size of a GIF is much bigger than an equivalent video ( often 5x to 10x bigger ) , so it takes much longer to download . Long answer : Think of a GIF like a flipbook . It 's a series of still pictures that when played quickly , look like a video . You need to download each one of those still pictures . Each frame is compressed , but little is done to take advantage of the fact that one frame is probably very similar to the next frame ( there are some minor optimizations done though -- for instance if the background of a frame does n't change at all from one frame to the next , that background wo n't be sent to you every time ) . Video uses much better compression techniques . Each frame is compressed like in a GIF , but frames are also compared to the one before and the one after . Just like in a GIF , if the background does n't change it wo n't be sent to you every time . But there are also more clever things that can be done -- say a car is moving from left to right in your video . Video compressors will basically say \" hey that car that was over there in the last frame , just move it to the right 5 pixels \" . So you take the image of the car you already have , shift it to the right , and that 's your next frame . GIF ca n't do this . Since a lot of video consists of smooth motion similar to this , videos compress very well . This is called [ motion compensation ] ( URL_0 ) . There are a number of other issues at play here too : * The compression technology used by GIF is far older than modern video compression , so that the compression achieved by each individual frame is better with modern videos . The LZW compression technique used in GIF is 30 + years old , for instance . * GIF uses lossless compression , whereas most videos use [ lossy compression ] ( URL_1 ) -- basically the video compressor throws away data that you 're probably not going to notice anyway . And even if you do notice it , chances are it 's still good enough to get the point across . ( JPEG is another example of a lossy compression scheme that you 're probably familiar with . ) * Along with this , video compressors throw away some color information as well . This one is harder to explain easily , but basically your eye is better at noticing changes in brightness rather than changes in color . So the compressor looks at the brightness and color of every pixel . When it comes time to write out the video , it stores the brightness for every pixel , but only stores the color for every 4th pixel . The other 3 pixels share that same color . Hopefully that made some amount of sense . It 's called [ Chroma subsampling ] ( URL_2 ) if you 'd like to read more . All that adds up to better compression for video , which means smaller file sizes , which means faster downloads . Edit : wording",

      "Online videos and GIFs are two different types of media that are loaded and played differently on your computer. \nVideos are usually streamed from a server to your computer, which means that your computer receives small pieces of the video at a time, and it plays them one after the other. This allows you to start watching the video almost immediately, even if the entire video has not yet been downloaded to your computer. \nGIFs, on the other hand, are usually loaded all at once, just like a regular image. This means that if the GIF is large or has a lot of frames (the \"pictures\" that make up the GIF), it can take longer to load. \nSo, the reason why videos stream smoothly on your computer and GIFs might seem to load slowly is because of the way they are loaded and played.

      "Italy was one of the major Axis powers during World War II, along with Germany and Japan. However, Italy's role in the war was not as significant as Germany's or Japan's. Germany was the main driving force behind the war and was responsible for many of the most heinous crimes committed during the conflict, such as the Holocaust, which resulted in the extermination of millions of Jews and other minority groups. Japan, on the other hand, was responsible for numerous war crimes in Asia, including the Nanjing Massacre, in which hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians were killed. \nAs a result, Germany and Japan have received more infamy and condemnation for their actions during the war. Italy, while it did participate in the war and committed its own crimes, has not received the same level of notoriety as these other two countries. \nIt's also important to note that after the war, both Germany and Japan underwent significant changes and have since become strong democratic countries.

There is little specialization , so the ability to produce items of exceptional quality is very limited .

It may be based on group consensus , physical strength , or hunting ability , but there is no way to accumulate stuff so as to be able to \" hire \" people . Wealth started with agriculture . Suddenly , not everyone had to be employed in the procurement of food 24/7 . Also , people were stationary , so they could build solid houses and accumulate stuff . Specialization allowed individuals to become highly skilled at a particular job , and thus to produce items of significantly higher quality . It also allowed the development of technology such as metal working that produced items that had a high value . It was these people who were released from the need to devote themselves to basic survival that allowed for the development of a basic economy .

      "The first wealthy humans likely became wealthy through a combination of luck, hard work, and being in the right place at the right time. For example, let's say that one of the first 1000 modern humans discovered a new source of food, like a field full of ripe berries or a river full of fish. This person might have been able to gather more food than they needed, and they could have traded or sold the excess to other people in exchange for things they needed or wanted. \nOver time, this person might have become known as someone who had a lot of food, and others might have wanted to trade with them or work for them in order to get some of that food.

For example, if someone invented a new tool or technique that made it easier to hunt or gather food, they might have been able to trade or sell that invention to others in exchange for resources. \nUltimately, there are many factors that could have contributed to the first wealthy humans becoming wealthy, and it likely varied from person to person.

    "question": "Why does live TV look different from pre - filmed TV , even when they are broadcast at the same quality ? Case in point : 30 rock live episodes vs normal episodes . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "You have a lot of time to do post - processing when it 's not live . That 's a main reason a movie is released months after filming has completed .",
      "Basically , you can move the lights around between camera setups , and you can color correct . In normal \" single camera \" shooting ( Like a normal 30 Rock episode ) , you can and do tweak the lighting pretty much every time you move the camera . Shooting live , you need a flatter \" general purpose \" lighting setup that will work okay for every angle but does n't necessarily look amazing at any angle . You also need all lights above the set and out of the field of view of the cameras in live production , whereas in single camera you can have a light or reflector just off camera for a nice effect . You can get the actors to shift their positions to get better shots . You can refresh makeup between takes . All sorts of little subtle things that you 'd never think of if you 've never been on a set because the end result makes it all look like it happens naturally . In live production , you ca n't change your mind about anything once the show starts . In many cases , you will also use different lenses in live production . In a single camera style shoot , you will have a person dedicated to focusing the camera . ( Focus Puller , or 1st Assistant Camera Operator . ) So , if you want to have nice soft blurry backgrounds that make the subject \" pop \" in the frame , you can shoot with \" wide open \" lenses so only the actor is in focus . To do that , you need to rehearse any camera or actor moves so the focus puller knows how to move the focus setting on the lens through the course of the shot . Autofocus is n't good enough because it does n't always know which thing should be in focus , and if it gets confused it may make the whole picture go blurry and useless for a bit which ruins the shot . The 1AC may need to use a measuring tape to check the exact distance between the camera and the actor to make sure things are exactly in focus , which requires walking into the camera 's field of view during shot setup . Obviously during live production you ca n't have somebody stopping the scene to measure , or repeating a take because focus was n't right so you \" stop down \" the lenses or use different lenses so you do n't get the nice soft background and more of the scene is in focus . When framing shots in single camera , you can put the camera right next to an actor 's face to get an interesting shot . But when shooting live , each camera has to stay out of the field of view of every other camera which limits how interesting and varied the shots can be that you can get . One camera person walking right up to an actor would be visible to the other cameras , ruining their shot in a live production so such gags would have to be * very * carefully planned . Then , in editing you would only pick the nicest looking takes , which is obviously impossible when shooting live . Then you send the project off to color correction where the image gets tweaked and refined until it looks like the director / DOP and colorist want it to . This is probably the biggest shift in the image that you are noticing , but it is the hardest to explain . Look for some colorist demo reels on vimeo , and you 'll see some idea of how much the image sometimes gets changed during coloring .",
      "Two main reasons . One , the cameras used in Live TV are often smaller and lighter , with a single color processing chip that results in less color distinction . Cameras on set are either higher end with multiple color processors , or still use Film . Post processing on higher end cameras allows for more polishing and tailoring forthe final product . Two , live TV is typically recorded at 30 frames per second ( or higher ) . Classic film and TV are shot in 24p ( 24 frames per second ) . This is what gives the biggest difference in the \" feel \" of live vs others . This is also why newer 120Hz+ HDTVs have that akward unnatural feel if you 're watching a show shot in 24p but being displayed at much faster refresh rate . In order to make up for the missing frames , the video processor speeds up and slows down certain frame sets ."

      "There are multiple kinds . The alcohol - based gels work by ruining the bacteria 's cell walls ; alcohol in high concentration is very lethal to nearly all bacteria . The outer layer of human skin is already dead , and a lot more resistant to being penetrated by alcohol ; the 30 seconds or so that you 're rubbing your hands is n't enough to get through that ( relatively ) thick layer of protein and other dead - cell bits .

It also strips your skin of some of its natural oils , which is why the hand gels usually have moisturizers in them . Related : Your stomach , and to some extent other parts of the digestive tract , is already protected against * some * chemicals because it 's such a strongly acidic environment anyway and it takes rapid cell replacement and a mucus layer to keep the acid from harming you . This also reduces damage from alcohol , though alcohol is still poison . Ethanol , the kind in liquor and beer , is a poison too , but mild to humans in very low concentrations and we 've evolved to be able to consume small amounts . It 's naturally present in fermenting fruit etc . anyway like we would have encountered in the wild . If you drink a human - potable form of alcohol ( say , vodka , which is usually 35 - 50 % ethanol ) the most it 'll do to your stomach , if you do n't overdo it , is irritate the lining ; stomachs are tough . Then it 's diluted heavily in your bloodstream .

Anxiety : Kierkegaard said , \" Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom . \" You feel anxiety because you recognize that you and you alone are responsible for your actions . This produces the two - sided feeling of simultaneous dread and exhilaration . Alienation : The sense that you 're a stranger in the world , or a stranger to yourself . Many aspects of existence can be alienating . One of the primary sources is absurdity . Ironically , the stories and systems developed by philosophy and religion to address that absurdity can be just as alienating . Existence precedes essence : Sartre 's phrase to describe the existential situation humans find themselves in . It refers to the fact that when you 're born , you have no meaning , no purpose , no definition . Human beings exist first , and only later define themselves . The \u00c3\u009cbermensch : The word Nietzsche uses to refer to his ideal human being . Literally \" overman , \" the word reflects the importance in his philosophy of overcoming \u00e2\u0080\u0094 overcoming traditional values , overcoming the herd mentality , and , most importantly , overcoming yourself . You overcome these things so that you might attain something greater . Nietzsche 's \u00c3\u009cbermensch is an unconventional creator of values , a joyous free spirit , and one who embraces the earth instead of pining away for heaven . The death of God : The death of the notion that belief in God alone , or belief in any religious or philosophical system , is sufficient to provide human beings with the meaning , purpose , and definition they crave . It 's the recognition that , because no external system can provide you with the answers , you must take responsibility for providing them yourself . Subjectivity : Your first - person perspective on the world , including the needs , desires , and emotions that accompany that perspective . The existentialists take this as a valid and important starting point for genuinely human endeavors . This can be contrasted with the scientific mindset , which always starts with objectivity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 seeing people in impersonal , objective terms without emotion or appreciation for their individual point of view .",
      "\" You are five Johnny . Go play . \" That 's how you explain existentialism to a five year old .",
      "Here 's are more simple view . Existentialism means that every person has an equal right to exist . No one is favored because they are \" in \" with some deity . This means that no one has the right to impose their views on anyone . Each person decides how to behave and to live with the consequences of those decisions . Harm no others ."

      "Existentialism is a philosophical way of thinking about the world and our place in it. It is concerned with questions about the meaning of life, and what it means to be human. \nOne of the main ideas of existentialism is that each person is responsible for creating their own meaning in life. This means that we have the freedom to choose how we want to live, and that we are responsible for the choices we make. \nExistentialism also emphasizes the importance of individual experience and subjective perspective. It suggests that each person's experience of the world is unique, and that it is up to each individual to decide what is important and meaningful to them. \nExistentialism can be a difficult concept to understand, but one way to think about it is that it is a way of looking at the world that emphasizes the importance of being true to oneself and living a life that is meaningful to you.",

    "human_answer": [
      "Since the past is our only reference point , let 's see when past forms of English became intelligible to modern speakers . I do n't think the high volume of written communication will have quite the effect the other commenters think . While written communication does preserve language , it by no means slows down change . Additionally , internet chats and texting have turned out to be ripe fields for linguistic play , so while I think our high volume of writing will have * an * effect , I 'm not convinced its effect will be to measurably slow down the evolution of the language . Changes do take longer to be entombed in writing though , so I think it 's likely you 'll be able to * read * future!English past the time you can no longer understand spoken future!English . By 1,000 years in the future I 'd expect future!English to be opaque to a speaker today . For reference , here 's English text from roughly 1,000 years ago ( Part of * Beowulf * ) > lange \u00c3\u00berage ; he him \u00c3\u00b0\u00c3\u00a6s lean forgeald .

You can guess a couple words in there , but it 's meaningless today . So , let 's come up about 500 years and take a look at ( of course ) Chaucer . > If I foryete to tellen the dispence Of Theseus , that gooth so bisily To maken up the lystes roially ; That swich a noble theatre as it was , I dar wel seyen , in this world ther nas . That looks better . If we update the spelling to be correct in today 's English : > If I forget to tellen the dispence of Theseus , that goeth so busily to maken up the lists royally ; that such a noble theater as it was , I dare well sayen , in this world there nas Hey , mostly intelligible !

It sounds like a very odd dialect of English , but with a little practice you could probably learn it . It is not , however , immediately intelligible to an English speaker today .

For funsies , [ here 's a guy ] ( URL_0 ) who posited what English could sound like in the future .",
      "I do n't think anyone really knows for sure . However : I think it would be a very , very long time . We live in a strange age . Adult literacy is much higher than it was 100 years ago , or even 50 years ago . We are increasingly moving to written forms of communication . If you go back to before Shakespeare 's time the written word was primarily used for record keeping . Stories were written down , but you would n't normally read them for pleasure , but read them out loud as entertainment . But now books and plays and tweets and reddit are written for everyone . The result is that the language has n't really changed that much . Whereas Chaucer ( 200 years before Shakespeare ) is almost impossible to a modern audience , Shakespeare and his contemporaries are quite understandable to a modern audience . And English has been standardised even more since then . Even in my lifetime I 've seen words which had different meanings in different places ( no - one uses the British billion any more ) become standardised , we 're increasingly using American spellings for things ( the British \" sceptic \" has fallen out of use , in favour of the American \" skeptic \" , with many British publishers preferring the second one ) . As we continue to be a society that communicates by writing , so we will continue to read and understand the writing of those before us , and the evolution of the language will slow down . There will be new vocabulary in the future that gets introduced , or old words that take on new meanings . ( \" Computer \" used to be a person whose job it was to calculate numbers . ) There will be new slang , and some old slang will fall out of fashion . There will be new concepts which need words to describe them . But because everything is likely to be archived and easily searchable you can probably go and look up words you do n't know easily enough . So there 's my predictions : in 1000 years they 'll still be reading Harry Potter , and we 'll still be able to understand them ( mostly ) , because the globalisation and the universal usage of written English has caused it to be standardised , and standardisation means the language evolves more slowly .",
      "We ca n't say because we 've never really had the sort of communication and recording technology we have in modern times . I would guess that if you excluded slang and technical jargon that English will remain more stable than in the past . If we include slang and jargon .... lmafo gtfo noob .

      "It's difficult to predict exactly how languages will evolve over time, but it's likely that if you were thrown into the future, you would be able to understand the English spoken there for at least a few hundred years. This is because even though languages change and evolve, they tend to do so gradually over long periods of time. \nHowever, it's also possible that English could change more quickly in the future due to factors such as technological advances or cultural changes. In that case, it might be more difficult for you to understand the English spoken in the future. \nOverall, it's important to remember that languages are always changing and evolving, and it's natural for new words and phrases to be added and for the meanings of existing words to shift over time. However, this process tends to happen slowly, so it's likely that you would still be able to understand the English spoken in the future for a significant period of time.",

      "There are a few reasons why it might cost more to cut down your own Christmas tree than to buy a pre-cut tree. One reason is that the cost of the tree itself might be higher at a farm where you can cut your own tree, because the farm is providing a service to you by allowing you to come and cut your own tree. This service might include things like providing a place to park, a place to warm up, and staff to assist you. \nAnother reason is that the cost of cutting down your own tree might include the cost of gas and other expenses related to driving out to the farm, such as wear and tear on your vehicle.

    "human_answer": [
      "Especially in the case of Tesla , when they released their Electric Vehicle patents last year , there was not enough electric vehicle infrastructure to make their product useful and desirable for a large market . If they want to create demand , Electric Cars and make EV 's desirable in the mass market , the speed at which new technologies ( for things like range between charges , and increasing the speed of charges ) has to increase , and one of the best ways to create an environment for that is competition . If Tesla and Toyota can create a competitive market for EV 's , new technologies will emerge faster , demand will go up , the market will increase and everybody makes money . In a world where there were only a few EV companies , and they were keeping their patents secret , all of the development and implementation costs would be on them . It would be crazy expensive and require a huge investment . This way , they are better able to spread those costs and that work around . In the end , they may own a smaller percentage of the market , but the market will be much larger then if they had gone for it alone . That 's why Tesla released all of their Electric Vehicle patents last year . The pace of development for the Hydrogen Fuel Cell car has been very very very slow , so Toyota has the same ideas for Fuel Cells . Create a market , increase competition , everybody profits . Also , the goal of getting the world of off fossil fuels ASAP is pretty admirable .",
      "Cars are worthless without the infrastructure to support them . If there are no hydrogen fuel stations , no one is going to buy one of Toyota 's fuel cell cars , no matter how cool and green they may be . So by making it easier for more companies to build fuel cell cars , Toyota encourages more hydrogen stations to open up which will lead to them selling more of these cars too . Likewise , Tesla will benefit if more people build superchargers that work with their vehicles ( something that 's only possible if you can use Tesla 's patents ) . Also , at this point , I 'm pretty sure Elon Musk is building technology because he thinks it 's a good idea and not because he 's trying to make money .",
      "Tesla had a huge incentive with the Gigafactory they 're building . They have a lot more to gain from selling / recycling batteries than they could from their patents . I 'm sure somewhere Toyota has a similar incentive somewhere in the chain ."

    "generated_answer": [
      "There are a few reasons why companies like Tesla and Toyota might choose to give away their patents. One reason might be to encourage the development of new technologies or to encourage the widespread adoption of their technologies. By making their patents available to other companies or individuals, they can help to stimulate innovation and competition, which can ultimately lead to the development of new products or services that benefit society as a whole. \nAnother reason that companies might give away their patents is to build partnerships or collaborations with other organizations. By sharing their patents with other companies, they can work together to develop new technologies or products, which can be beneficial for both parties. \nIt's important to note that giving away patents does not necessarily mean that a company is giving up all rights to their technology.

Google 's browser , Chrome , is one of the things that Google does to try and make the Internet faster . Originally , their goal was just to give other browser vendors a kick in the ass to make their own browsers faster , which they have . Since Chrome has become so popular , they use it to promote other technologies that make the Internet faster or cheaper , like SPDY ( HTTP2 ) and WebM.

These browsers are basically extensions of their respective operating systems , and their primary purpose is to make their operating systems more fully - featured . Windows has a browser just so that you ca n't say \" Windows does n't even have a browser ! \" Microsoft used to use IE to push its own technologies as development platforms for internet and intranet applications ( VBScript , ActiveX , XmlHttpRequest , etc ) but they 've backed off from that , and right now just want to be able to say that out - of - the - box Windows is the only software you need .

      "ATM Field Service Engineer the entire process is actually quite simple . If we 're taking about a machine that only dispenses cash a transaction works like this ; the customer inserts there card , the card reader pulls the i d number off of said card , the machine then asks for a PIN ( when you PIN is entered it is automatically encrypted in the pad before it ever reaches the computer ) . Most machines at this point will let the customer go ahead and make their selections for how much cash they would like to withdraw and in what denominations . Once the withdraw amount has been selected the machine calls out to the banks server and gives the card data and the encrypted PIN for verification and insures the account has the funds to be drawn from . ( You normal wo n't know if you 've mistyped your PIN for this reason the machine try 's to make as few network calls as possible by bundling all the data and sending it at once ) Once it gets the ok to dispense it will begin to cycle seeing which cassette it should pull from depending on what types of bills were selected by the customer . It will the procure said bills and begin writing to your receipt . Here 's the lag time you were asking about originally , after a transaction is complete the machine cycles much like it would if it were going dispense and will check each sensor for jams or motors that could be malfunctioning .

    "human_answer": [
      "Not really ELI5 - able because it 's a complicated subject but : So , whenever you sell property ( subject to an insane number of rules ) you calculated the amount that you gained or lost on your investment , and if you had a gain ( called a \" capital gain \" ) they you pay taxes on that gain . As an example : you buy $ 10,000 worth of stock , then sell it a year later for $ 30,000 ( good investment ) and pay taxes on your $ 20,000 ( $ 30,000 - $ 10,000 ) profit . Now , for inherited items , this gets a little tricky . So instead of you buying that stock , lets say your grandfather bought it at $ 10,000 and when he died it was worth $ 25,000 , and when you finally sold it you got $ 30,000 for it . Under the current tax plan , you 're only required to pay taxes on a gain of $ 5,000 , because you 're allowed to use the value at the time of inheritance as your \" basis \" in the stock ( \" basis \" is the technical term for basically \" the value you calculate your gain / loss from \" ) . * * Under the new plan :* * you would instead pay taxes on the $ 20,000 gain , using the original $ 10,000 basis from the original purchase of the stock ( with exemptions of something like $ 250,000 per person , to spare the middle class ) . Also , note that capital gains have generally been taxed at a lower percentage than ordinary income ( currently 15 % for anyone in the 25 % income tax bracket or up ) , with the rationale being basically that this will encourage business investment . Of course , since many very rich people make the vast majority of their income in the form of capital gains and not salary , it also causes the famous case of billionaires paying lower tax rates than their secretaries ( see : Buffett , Warren ) . In a related proposal , Obama has suggest raising the capital gains rate to 28 % for couples with incomes in excess of $ 500,000 . Those two changes would result in the government raising a lot of extra revenue ( as well as long - term macroeconomic consequences that I am not qualified to speculate on ) . Source : I prepared taxes professionally for five years",
      "Let 's say you buy stock at $ 10 . You hold it for 20 years , and now it 's worth $ 100 . Normally , when you sell that asset , you pay capital gains taxes on the $ 90 difference in price . Now , you put that stock into a trust and you drop dead before selling it . Your children crack the trust at the $ 100 level . When they sell it , they do n't pay the capital gains tax on the $ 90 profit , as they obtained it at the $ 100 level . Thus , all that income generated from the stock is never taxed at all . As a result , there 's $ 90 per share worth of taxes [ or , more accurately , 20 years of capital gains taxes ] just getting lost .",
      "When you buy capital assets ( think of things like stocks ) , you have what is called a \" basis \" in that asset . Your basis is usually , with some exceptions , what you paid to purchase the asset . So for example , if you bought a share of stock for $ 100 , your basis in that share of stock is $ 100 . When you sell the stock later , if it is worth more than it was when you bought it , you have \" capital gain . \" The capital gain is the increase in value between your basis and the amount you sold it for . So in this example , lets say that 5 years later , the stock is worth $ 150 . When you sell this stock , you have $ 50 of capital gain . Here is the part that Obama calls the \" Trust Fund Loophole . \" When a person dies , then can give their capital assets to a relative . When they do this , the basis in the assets given is automatically changed to same value as the current value of the asset . So in our example , if the person did n't sell the stock , and instead gave it to their daughter when they died , the daughter now owns the stock and the basis is $ 150 . This is important because it allows the daughter to sell the stock immediately , and pay no capital gains taxes . Had the father sold it before he died , he would have paid capital gains taxes on the $ 50 of capital gains ."

      "I'm sorry, but I don't have information about a specific trust fund loophole mentioned by President Obama in a State of the Union address. Trust funds are financial instruments that are set up to hold and manage assets on behalf of a specific person or group of people. The assets in a trust fund can come from a variety of sources, such as investments, gifts, or inheritance, and the trust fund is managed by a trustee, who is responsible for distributing the assets in the trust according to the terms of the trust agreement. \nA loophole is a gap or weakness in a law or system that can be exploited or used to avoid a requirement or restriction. It's possible that President Obama was referring to a specific provision in the tax code that allows certain types of trust funds to be used in a way that might be perceived as avoiding taxes or otherwise taking advantage of the system.

A wolf to a dog , or one type of bird into another , for example . Macroevolution , to them , means one species or \" kind \" changing into another . Like fish into things that walk on land . The idea of \" kinds \" comes from the Bible , for example in the story of Noah : > In the selfsame day entered Noah , and Shem , and Ham , and Japheth , the sons of Noah , and Noah 's wife , and the three wives of his sons with them , into the ark ; They , and every beast after his kind , and all the cattle after their kind , and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind , and every fowl after his kind , every bird of every sort . ( Gen 7:13 - 14 ) This idea does n't necessarily line up with the scientific idea of \" species . \" For example , in this view , all hoofed animals might belong to the same \" kind . \" It does allow them to say that maybe Noah only brought a few animals onto the Ark , representing all of the different \" kinds , \" and then after that , they changed into all the animals we have today ( while still staying within their \" kind \" ) .

      "People who do not believe in evolution can explain things like breeding dogs and why people look like their parents in a number of ways. One possibility is that they believe that these things are the result of a divine or supernatural force that has shaped the world and its inhabitants in a specific way. For example, they might believe that God or another higher power created dogs with the ability to breed and produce offspring that resemble their parents because that is what God or the higher power wanted to happen. \nAlternatively, people who do not believe in evolution might believe that these things occur through some other natural process that is not related to evolution. For example, they might believe that the similarities between parents and their children are simply due to genetics, and that genetics works in a way that is unrelated to evolution. \nIn any case, it is important to note that the scientific theory of evolution explains these phenomena through the process of natural selection, in which certain traits are passed down from one generation to the next because they help the organisms that have them to survive and reproduce. This process is supported by a large body of evidence from many different fields of science, including paleontology, genetics, and more.",

    "human_answer": [
      "Emotions evolved from communication . For example wolf who was able to bark when danger occured saved its pack members thus increasing it own chance of survival . Wolfs who did n't react / understand to react to danger more likely perished . I think love is more primitive thing . It is just feeling that one should mate with another one .",
      "Certain animals reproductive strategy require parental cooperation . Humans call both the urge to create a relationship , and the urge to maintain relationships , \" love \" . All of our emotions are essentially simply our way of perceiving instinctual urges , or at least urges that are strong enough for us to notice them . edit : Animals that do not form mating bonds have different chemical receptors . The hormones that correspond to lust / love would have no effect on animals that do n't bond . Those hormones are related to pleasure / reward . So , for instance , if a prairie vole ( which forms bonds ) * either * mates or has the hormones injected , they will bond . A montane vole ( which does not bond ) could mate , and it does n't do anything . Inject the hormones that a prairie vole produces from mating , and it has no effect . They simply will not form bonds . Presumably , this bonding process is pleasurable , since the hormones are essentially providing a reward .",
      "[ Affective neuroscience ] ( URL_1 ) is a very interesting area of study which examines \" the study of the neural mechanisms of emotion . This interdisciplinary field combines neuroscience with the psychological study of personality , emotion , and mood . \" It also examines how our own neural mechanisms are mirrored in animals ( and especially mammals ) because of shared ancestry . The study of motion is definitely a very active area of science that permeates many different fields - evolutionary biology , animal behaviour , human behaviour , animal communication , human communication , origin of communication , psychology , psychiatry , neurobiology ... each look at different questions concerning emotions . In ELI5 words this means that animals are certainly capable of feeling emotions because the neural mechanisms that produce emotions are conserved through evolution , and are similar to the neural mechanisms that produce emotions in ourselves . All mammals , being related through common ancestry , have even more similar and conserved mechanisms - humans are of course mammals too ! But a few things to note : 1 . The way animals express a particular emotion may differ from the way humans express that emotion . For example , humans often smile to exhibit happiness . But for the rest of the primate order smiling is either a signal of submissiveness or fear . This does not mean that other primates are incapable of feeling happiness , but that they very likely express it in different ways from ourselves . We also have to be very mindful that other animals , even cognitively complex ones , may be physically constrained and incapable of complex facial expressions . For example , we know dolphins are capable of a lot of complex cognitive tasks , they are able to identify themselves in the mirror and they may even have names for one another ... but they do n't have the facial musculature to make the expressions that are , well , as expressive as ours . Their emotions may not even be obvious for this reason , but that does n't mean they do n't exist . 2 . Humans like to make emotions poetic , like love . But love is simply a kind of attachment emotion . Humans become attached to each other and objects , sometimes to the point of obsession . Animals also become attached to each other . Mothers and their infants , bonding pairs of adults ... all forms of attachment exhibited in the animal kingdom . Again if you were interested in studying * love * , as a scientist you would actually study * attachment * . I recommend the book [ affective neuroscience : the foundations of human and animal emotions ] ( URL_2 ) . It can be rather technical , but it is very good read . In any case , if we want to objectively study emotion and their origins , we sort of need to take the \" humanity \" out of emotions and look at them in a more universal way . Edit : For something a little more directed towards the layman , [ the moral lives of animals ] ( URL_0 ) is a very good read , as is [ age of empathy ] ( URL_3 ) ."

      "Emotions and love are complex phenomena that have evolved in many different species, including humans and other mammals. Scientists believe that emotions and social bonds, like love, have evolved in animals because they help them to survive and reproduce. \nFor example, emotions like fear and anxiety help animals to avoid dangerous situations, while positive emotions like joy and love help animals to form social bonds and cooperate with others. These social bonds can be important for finding food, raising young, and protecting against predators. \nLove is a particularly powerful emotion that can motivate us to take care of and protect our loved ones. In humans and other mammals, love is often associated with the hormone oxytocin, which is involved in bonding and attachment. \nIt's important to note that the way animals experience and express emotions is likely to be different from the way humans do. However, the basic functions of emotions and social bonds, like love, are likely to be similar across different species.",

    "human_answer": [
      "A ' DJ set ' is one that comprises wholly of an artist ' mixing ' 2 ( or some times more ) separate , pre - recorded tracks . This effectively means using multiple songs to create one , uninterrupted ' set ' of 30mins or more . Whilst effects can be used to augment the songs ( e.g. delay ) , there is no element of new song design - the DJ merely plays with what is already there in the song . A ' live DJ set ' involves the DJ constructing the song from pre - made samples or from creating the songs entirely from scratch , using sounds from a digital source ( e.g. Ableton ) and then augmenting the song they have made as they go along . The easiest analogy is between a musician playing their album from start to finish without stopping , but not improvising and a musician playing their songs with entirely new , improvised sections perhaps in a different order . This is an example of one of my favourite live electronic artists , ' Jon Hopkins ' : URL_0",

A DJ does n't perform , he just plays music for people to enjoy , and often will put in some effort to craft a playlist ( sometimes on the fly ) that flows nicely , and have one track segue smoothly into the next . So that 's what some electronic music artists do live : they just DJ their own music . The music is 100 % premade , and they just play them in a particular order with a cool light show . You do n't really go to watch the artist so much as you go to hear the music on a big system with a hyped up crowd .

They 'll actually have a keyboard or something with them , and play parts of the music live . Others will have a sampler loaded with tons of cool sounds , which they 'll throw in to keep things interesting . Still others will bring a remixing aspect in , using turntablism or sampling to remix their own music in real time .

      "There are a few different ways that electronic music artists can perform their music live. Here are a few examples: \n1. Using a laptop or other computer: Many electronic music artists use a laptop or other computer to run software that allows them to play their music and create new sounds in real-time. They might use software like Ableton Live, which allows them to trigger pre-recorded samples and loops, or synthesizers and other virtual instruments to create new sounds on the fly. \n2. Using hardware synthesizers and drum machines: Some electronic music artists prefer to use hardware synthesizers and drum machines to create their sounds. These are physical devices that can be played like an instrument and can create a wide range of electronic sounds. \n3. Using a DJ controller: Some electronic music artists, especially those who make dance music, use a DJ controller to mix and match different tracks and create new music on the fly. A DJ controller is a device that looks like a mixer and is usually connected to a laptop or other computer, allowing the artist to manipulate the music using faders, knobs, and buttons. \n4. Using live instrumentation: Some electronic music artists incorporate live instrumentation into their performances, such as playing drums, guitar, or other instruments. They might use these instruments to add a live element to their music, or they might use them to create new sounds and layers that they can mix in with their electronic music. \nOverall, there are many different ways that electronic music artists can perform their music live, and the specific approach they take will depend on their personal style and the equipment they have available.",

    "question": "Why is suicide/ assisted suicide illegal ? Why is it that someone terminal , or even just in immense pain can not ask to end their life with ease ? What is the justification behind not allowing it ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "In almost everywhere in the US ( if not everywhere ) , suicide / attempted suicide is not illegal . Obviously you can be detained and then committed to an institution but it 's not because its illegal but it 's under some other law that authorizes such actions if there is a reasonable belief someone is a danger to themselves or others . Granted a lot of the repercussions of this are similar to being arrested for illegal acts , being detained , held against your will in a facility , losing some rights etc . , but there 's also some differences such as not having a criminal record . Assisted suicide is illegal though , and that 's partially because the state does n't want to be involved in trying to determine if someone is guilty of murder or if they were just assisting suicide , and the other part being it 's stance against suicide anyhow . Even in states that have death with dignity acts , they 're not exactly assisted suicide . The terminally ill patients meet with multiple doctors over a period of time and the doctor will give the patient a drug that they take on their own , so the doctor is n't directly involved with the death .",
      "If its for someone who is terminally ill and in immense pain I think it can be justified , but the bigger question that comes in to play is ' where do you draw the line ? ' - is it certain illnesses or time frames on how long someone has to live . Mental illness is also a major player , if someone is suffering major depression suicide can seem like a logical answer . However when people are in these suicidal states its often described as being almost drunk with the intention . For the ones that recover its often a blurred memory of what happened . On another angle even though you can say it 's their choice and blah blah , it fucking destroys families and leaves behind giant skeletons in the closets of the people that were the closest to them .",
      "This is not really something that can be explained like you 're five . This is n't something that can be explained at all . This is a long philosophical debate with no correct answer , and it depends on where * you * want to draw the line and what sort of morals * you * hold . But I guess the tl;Dr of it would be because those who consider suicide are often not in a healthy mental state to make logical and critical decisions . Suicidal individuals are often depressed . They can only see one side of things : the negative side . For example , if a suicidal individual sends you a text and you , for one reason or another , do n't reply , they wo n't take it the same way as a mentally healthy person . We might think \" well he might just be busy or he just does n't want to reply now , \" that is if we think about it at all . A suicidal individual , on the other hand , would probably think \" he does n't want to reply to me . He does n't like me . Nobody likes me . I 'm alone . \" Of course this is just an example , but it gives the general idea , I believe . I went on the verge of feeling suicidal during a phase of depression and I 've considered ending it all a few times . I even had the lyrics of my favorite song scribbled down on a piece of paper and I left it in my wallet just in case I do anything , so it can be taken as a suicide note . It 's a rather weird song . It can easily be interpreted as a celebration of life to give the listener hope , but it can just as easily be depressing and seem like a desperate cry for help . Anyway I 'm digressing . Now that I think about it , I do n't think I 've ever truly had it in me to end it all . I had only considered one side of things and I did n't think about the bigger picture . And when it came to it , had I really ended it all , it would 've been a stupid spur - of - the - moment sort of decision . If you 're talking about euthanasia , however , then that 's something completely different . I hope that explains it ."

      "Stopping a meteor from hitting Earth would be a very difficult task, and the chances of success would depend on a number of factors, including the size of the meteor, how much warning we have before it hits, and how much time and resources we have to prepare. Here's a simple explanation of how it might work: \n1. First, we would need to detect the meteor and determine its trajectory. This could be done using telescopes or satellites that are designed to look for objects moving through space. \n2. Once we know where the meteor is headed, we would need to decide how to stop it. There are a few different ways we might try to do this, depending on the size of the meteor and how much time we have before it hits. \n3. One option would be to use a \"gravity tractor,\" which is a spacecraft that would fly alongside the meteor and use its own gravitational pull to slowly change the meteor's course. This would take a long time, and might not be practical if we don't have enough warning. \n4. Another option would be to use a \"kinetic impactor,\" which is a spacecraft that would collide with the meteor at high speed. This would try to knock the meteor off course or break it into smaller pieces that would be less dangerous. \n5. Finally, we might try to use a \"nuclear device,\" which is a bomb that would explode near the meteor and try to break it up or change its course. This would be a very risky option, because a nuclear explosion could create a lot of debris that could also hit Earth. \nOverall, stopping a meteor from hitting Earth would be a very challenging task, and the chances of success would depend on a lot of factors. It would require a coordinated effort from scientists, engineers, and government agencies around the world, and we would need to act quickly and make some difficult decisions.",

    "generated_answer": [
      "Curved televisions have a screen that is curved, rather than flat. The curve is usually gentle and is designed to be more immersive for the viewer. Some people think that the curve helps to make the image on the screen feel more \"wraparound,\" like you're looking at a bigger, more expansive scene. \nThere are a few potential benefits to using a curved television. For one, the curve of the screen can help to reduce reflections from windows or other light sources in the room. This can make it easier to see the picture on the screen, especially in a brightly lit room. Additionally, some people find that the curve helps to make the edges of the screen feel more \"invisible,\" which can make the picture feel more \"all-encompassing.\" \nHowever, it's worth noting that not everyone finds curved televisions to be an improvement over flat screens. Some people find that the curve causes distortion in the image, which can be distracting. Additionally, curved TVs are generally more expensive than flat TVs, so they may not be the best choice for everyone.",

    "question": "How does adding volumes work ? I know this might seem like a silly question , but for example when 10 people are talking at 20 dB , what happens to the resulting dB heard by somebody in the room ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "There are some simple rules for calculating with db . The easiest one to remember is that multiplying something by a numbers adds something to the db value . Multiplying with 10 adds exactly 10 db . So you would hear all the people talking at 30 db . Another rule that is handy to now is that multiplying by 2 adds about 3 db . That means 2 people would make 23 db noise , 4 people 26 db and 8 people 29 db . In addition to that you can split larger numbers up for example multiplying by 80 ( for example 80 talking people ) would be 8 * 10 which is 2 * 2 * 2 * 10 and with the mentioned rules you get 3 + 3 + 3 + 10 = 19db more . But that 's just a theoretical value that would work if all the sound happens at the same place . People are usually not just standing inside each other that 's why you 'd end up with slightly different numbers if your standing in the middle of the 10 people or right next besides them . But it works just fine for most applications .",
      "A decibel is actually a * logarithmic * unit , meaning that each ten steps up the scale is actually a ten times increase in intensity . 20dB represents a relative intensity of 100 so if you added ten of those together it could reach 1000 intensity which is 30dB But really , there 's a bit more going on than that with stuff like sound waves cancelling eachother out , so it 'll probably end up somewhere between 20 and 30 decibels",
      "If you have N violins playing the same note , they wo n't all be playing in sync : each of theirs sounds forms a wave but the peaks and troughs of the waves do n't necessary match up with eachother even if their frequency is exactly the same . This means that the N violins are N times as loud as N individual violins . Instead they will be sqrt(N ) louder ( and then take into account that the decibels are logarithmic ) . Here 's a website on this : URL_0 Edit : I guess the ELI5 here is that if you put two violins together playing the same note , then you would add 3dB to the decibel level of a single violin . This +3 does n't depend upon how loud the violins were - whether each one was individually 10 dB or 100 dB , you 'd add 3 when you got the second one ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "When multiple sounds are present at the same time, they can combine to create a louder or quieter overall sound. This is called \"additive volume.\" \nImagine you have two speakers that are both playing music at the same volume. If you stand in the middle of the speakers, the music will sound louder than if you stand next to just one of the speakers. This is because the sound waves from both speakers are combining and adding together to create a louder overall sound. \nNow, let's say that instead of two speakers, you have 10 people all talking at the same volume (let's say 20 dB). If you are in the same room as all of the people, the overall sound will be louder than if you were just listening to one person speaking at 20 dB. This is because all of the voices are combining and adding together to create a louder overall sound. \nSo, to answer your question, when multiple people are talking at the same volume (like 20 dB), the resulting sound that you hear will be louder than if you were just listening to one person speaking at that volume. The exact amount of volume increase will depend on the number of people talking and the volume of their individual voices.",

      "There 's a lot of different ways to alter difficulty in a game like that , it really just depends on how the AI is constructed . For example , every player has different stats ( some good at shooting three - pointers , some good at long passes , etc . ) . On the easy setting maybe each AI player is not aware of the other players stats and it chooses to pass the ball randomly instead of considering their teammates proficiencies . On a higher difficulty each AI player might have full access to the other AI players ' stats and so it will only pass the ball to the person who can shoot the best from that distance . Additionally the game could just skew the AI stats based on the difficulty . Maybe on easy it drops everyone 's ability to shoot / pass / whatever by an amount , on medium it uses their actual stats , and on hard it increases their stats by an amount so everyone on the team can shoot / pass / whatever really well . In a lot of AI structures the main way to alter behavior like this is to add randomness . You normally have them make a decision based on the data present ( i.e. pass to the guy with the best shooting ability ) but then you set a threshold for randomness , so say 5 % of the time instead of passing to the best player you pass to a random player . To make the game more easy / difficult you could alter the chance of them taking random actions instead of optimal actions .

When an alcoholic picks up another bottle of beer even though every thought in his mind is telling him not , he does n't decide to drink it anyway because a chemical imbalance is causing low - self esteem , he drinks it anyway because he subconsciously does n't * believe * he can . That 's why a guy might go years without asking out a girl due to believing he is undesirable and boring , and a result of that is that he 'll develop a chemical imbalance because of it . However , when one day he finds himself alone with the pretty girl he 's been helping do homework and decides to just go for it and she says yes , he 'll * instantly * feel over the moon and incredibly self - confident , since his idea that he 's undatable has been shattered and him coming to this realisation feels incredibly powerful and liberating . A result of this is that physically , his chemicals in his brain have changed , but he did n't feel good * because * they changed , they changed because * he felt good . *",

But making these molecules is very complex and takes a lot of energy . So , instead of recreating these molecules , your body tends to reuse them where possible . At some point , due to external or internal influences , your body starts to reuse some chemicals too much , depleting the amount of chemicals available for whatever they are needed for ( e.g. see certain things as dangerous , if you have too few of a certain chemical , you start seeing everything as a danger to yourself ) So , in basic , a lack of , or too much of , a specific chemical in your body , triggers certain actions in your brain . Just like too much alcohol can destroy your liver , too much of certain chemicals can cause imbalance in your brain , causing anxiety , esteem - issues , anger - issues etc ."

      "Self-esteem is a person's overall sense of self-worth or how they value themselves. It is not solely based on chemical processes in the body, but rather is influenced by a variety of factors including life experiences, thoughts, and beliefs, and social and cultural influences. \nIt is normal for self-esteem to fluctuate and change over time, and it can be affected by both positive and negative experiences. For example, a person who receives positive feedback and recognition for their accomplishments may have a higher sense of self-esteem, while a person who experiences failure or criticism may have a lower sense of self-esteem. \nWhile chemical processes in the body, such as the release of certain hormones or neurotransmitters, can influence a person's mood and emotions, they do not directly determine self-esteem. However, mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety can affect self-esteem, and these conditions may be influenced by chemical imbalances in the body. \nIt is important to remember that self-esteem is not fixed and can be improved with effort and self-care. It is important to focus on building self-esteem by setting and achieving goals, practicing self-compassion and self-acceptance, and surrounding oneself with supportive and positive people.",

      "That 's because they do n't do that . At least , a simple single speaker does n't . A simple tone would be a regular sinusoidal variation , going in and out with the same period each time .

You can make a microphone like this , but it 's not the most efficient way to do it . They usually use other components . Now imagine you have two tones , one high and one low . The two waves on a microphone would add together . This will give a more complicated wave that is the two waves added together . If you made the speaker oscillate in this exact same pattern , it would produce the two tones at once . [ Example image ] ( URL_0 ) From there you can just keep adding as many frequencies as you like .

    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "Speakers produce sound by vibrating a flexible membrane called a diaphragm. When an electrical signal is sent to the speaker, it causes the diaphragm to move back and forth rapidly, creating sound waves in the air. \nThe shape and movement of the diaphragm determines the type of sound that the speaker produces. For example, if the diaphragm moves in a simple, regular pattern, it will produce a pure tone or sine wave. However, if the diaphragm moves in a more complex pattern, it can produce more complex waveforms, such as those found in music and other sounds. \nTo create these complex waveforms, the speaker uses multiple small electrical signals that are combined together. Each signal causes a specific part of the diaphragm to vibrate in a certain way, and when all of these vibrations are combined, they create the overall movement of the diaphragm. \nThink of it like a group of people all clapping together to make a beat. Each person is making a simple clapping motion, but when they all clap together, they create a more complex and varied sound. Similarly, the different signals sent to the speaker's diaphragm work together to create a more complex sound wave.",

      "Perfectionism is the belief that everything must be done perfectly, or it is not worth doing at all. This can be a negative trait because it can lead to unrealistic expectations and an inability to accept mistakes or imperfections. It can also lead to excessive stress, anxiety, and disappointment. \nDoing your best, on the other hand, means trying your hardest and striving for excellence, but also accepting that mistakes and imperfections are a natural part of the process. It means being proud of what you have achieved, even if it is not perfect. \nImagine you are trying to draw a picture. If you are a perfectionist, you might get frustrated if the lines are not perfectly straight, or if the colors are not exactly as you imagined them. You might even give up on the drawing altogether because it is not perfect. If you are just trying your best, you might still strive to make your drawing as good as possible, but you will also be proud of what you have created, even if it is not perfect. \nSo in short, perfectionism is the belief that everything must be perfect, while doing your best means trying your hardest and being proud of your efforts, even if they are not perfect.",

    "generated_answer": [
      "The passive tense is not considered incorrect by most English professors. It is a grammatically correct way to construct a sentence in English. However, it is often considered less desirable than the active tense because it can make sentences less direct and less clear. \nIn the active tense, the subject of the sentence is performing the action. For example, in the sentence \"The car struck her,\" the subject of the sentence is \"the car,\" and it is performing the action of striking. \nIn the passive tense, the subject of the sentence is receiving the action. For example, in the sentence \"She was struck by a car,\" the subject of the sentence is \"she,\" and she is receiving the action of being struck. \nThe passive tense can make sentences less direct and less clear because it can make it less obvious who is performing the action. It can also make sentences longer and more wordy. \nFor these reasons, many English professors and writing guides recommend using the active tense whenever possible to make your writing clearer and more concise. However, there are times when the passive tense can be useful, such as when you want to emphasize the person or thing receiving the action, or when you don't know who is performing the action.",

France was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1940, and after a series of battles, the French government was forced to sign an armistice with Germany, which effectively ended the fighting between the two countries. \nIt is important to remember that the decision to surrender is often a difficult one that is made by governments and military leaders, and it is not meant to be taken lightly. Surrendering can be seen as a way to protect the lives and well-being of the people in the country, and it can also be a way to end a conflict that has caused a lot of suffering and destruction.

    "question": "What is stopping private banks from just \" creating \" money in their own accounts ? Numbers on our bank statements are n't necessarily backed by actual cash , so how is this behavior prevented ? How are all electronic transactions tracked without a blockchain - like ledger ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Well in a practical sense , it 's a crime , so there 's that . In an actual sense , there is n't really much stopping this from happening , other than law abiding . The only bank that can do this is the Federal Reserve Bank , and they do n't even do it in the sense that your question is asking . They do n't just magically add a few zeroes to an account and call it a day . It 's a process called Quantitative Easing where the Federal Reserve manipulates the government bonds in such a way so as to withdraw or add money into the economy . This process has an effect on regular banks , but not in the way your question poses . Average banks , such as Chase , Bank Of America , Wells Fargo , etc . are all puppets of the Federal Reserve 's decisions . The way the Fed manipulates the supply of money in the economy has an effect on the interest rates that banks issue . When the supply of money in the economy is tampered by the Fed , interest rates that your average banks issue have to accompany the economic stalemate or prosperity that the Fed stimulates .",
      "Same thing that stops any other company from lying about how much money they have . It 's hard to actually profit from doing it , regulations make it difficult to hide , and anyone who got caught doing it would go to jail .",
      "in terms of just changing the numbers , the only thing that stops that is the federal reserve and to a lesser extent regulators who audit those banks . if a bank is making it 's own money it 's defrauding the federal reserve ... who does n't really like them doing that . however there is one way a bank can create money : fractional reserve . say i own a bank , you put $ 100 in my bank i take that money and invest $ 60 of it ( think it 's 40 % they need to keep in ) as a loan to someone who needs a loan . i have $ 100 in your account , but i am also owed $ 60 from the guy i loaned your money to ( the money i say is in your account is still considered money AND the loan is considered money , and when he pays me back i made profit on the interest ) in this way a private bank can CREATE money . now some complexity happens if you ask for your $ 100 back before the loan is paid back , if that happens i give you your $ 40 plus $ 60 from someone else 's account . if everyone makes a run on the bank at once there is a problem , and to keep from needing to call in a bunch of loans or limit people 's ability to withdraw money , banks have to keep a certain amount of insurance to cover bank runs , and if need be can borrow from the federal reserve to prevent failure ( in the 1930 's this was a problem , banks had out a bunch of loans , people made a run on some banks , the banks could n't pay back , the back failed and a lot of people lost all their money , this caused more people to run and withdraw their cash so they do n't lose it causing a chain reaction of bank runs and bank failures , one of the catalysts for the great depression )"

      "Private banks, also known as commercial banks, do not have the ability to create money out of thin air. Instead, they are regulated financial institutions that must follow certain rules and regulations set by government agencies and central banks. \nWhen a person or business deposits money into a private bank, the bank is required to hold a certain amount of that money in reserve, which can be used to cover any withdrawals that the depositor may request. The bank can then lend out the remaining money to other people or businesses in the form of loans. This is how private banks make most of their profits. \nPrivate banks are not allowed to simply create new money and add it to their own accounts or the accounts of their customers. This would be considered fraud and is illegal. \nElectronic transactions between private banks are tracked through a centralized system called the Automated Clearing House (ACH), which is operated by the National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA). This system allows banks to securely transfer money between each other and keep track of all the transactions that have taken place. \nIn summary, private banks are regulated financial institutions that must follow certain rules and regulations to prevent them from creating money out of thin air. They make most of their profits by lending out the money that their customers deposit with them, and electronic transactions between private banks are tracked through a centralized system called the ACH.",

      "A judge in Texas, or any other state, does not have the power to block an executive action taken by the President of the United States. Executive actions are a type of presidential directive that have the force of law and are used to carry out the policies and priorities of the president. \nOnly the Supreme Court of the United States has the power to declare an executive action taken by the President to be unconstitutional. This process is called judicial review. In order for the Supreme Court to hear a case challenging an executive action, the case must be brought before the court through a legal process called \"appeal.\" \nIn addition to judicial review, Congress also has the power to block or overturn an executive action taken by the President. This can be done through a process called \"legislative veto,\" in which Congress passes a resolution disapproving of the executive action. However, the legislative veto can be vetoed by the President, and Congress would need a two-thirds majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate to override the veto. \nSo, while a judge in Texas or any other state does not have the power to block an executive action taken by the President, the action can be challenged and potentially overturned through the legal process of judicial review or through the legislative process by Congress.",

    "question": "Why do Nasa launch rockets from sea level instead of from the top of a mountain if they launch from a higher point they will need less fuel because they have to go a shorter distance , right ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Its better to launch rockets closer to the equator . Its so that the rocket launches at the same speed of the earth spinning . There is also to my knowledge no mountains that are close to the equator in America",
      "There are a lot of things you want out of a launch site . The first is that you want it in your own country . Many rocket payloads are sensitive to national security and you do n't want to ship them to another country to launch them . Next you need a big area where debris can rain down in the event of either a launch failure or just stage separation . Thus far there are no launch vehicles that can get a payload to orbit with a single stage from launch , so there 's going to be * something * dropping from every launch . Oceans work very well for this , as does Siberia . Oceans and mountains are often far apart . After that you tend to want to be close to the equator , at least for most launches . If you 're going into a \" normal \" orbit then launch eastward to make use of the rotational velocity of the earth . This can be as much as 1000 mph that you do n't have to achieve on your own , which is a big deal . Some launches require going pretty much directly north or south ( e.g. Sun Synchronous or Polar orbits ) , for which Vandenburg AFB in California is useful . When you put all of these requirements together you 're left with some pretty obvious choices for launch locations . The southern - most areas in the US that are near vast uninhabited areas ( i.e. oceans ) are the Southern tip of Texas , California , and Florida . Florida is more conveniently located ( plenty of industry nearby ) so it got the bid for most of NASA 's launches . California is only good if you 're not launching East , so it 's used for some launches . Now SpaceX has started construction on a facility in the southern tip of Texas to have their own facility . * * * * * * * With all of that said , yes , you would like a higher launch site , all else being equal . It gets you above a lot of the atmosphere which can be a real drag ; pun most definitely intended . However , all else is not equal and the other concerns are more substantial . It 's worth pointing out that getting to orbit is n't about getting to a high altitude \u00e2\u0080\u0094 orbit is only about 250 miles up ( altitude of the ISS ) . It 's about getting to a high speed . The space shuttle can get to the altitude of the top of Mt Everest in about 52 seconds , and that 's not even traveling straight up . By that point it 's already moving largely horizontally at an overall speed of about Mach 1.2 .",

      "Rockets are launched from the ground, not from the top of a mountain, because it is easier and more practical to build the infrastructure needed for launching rockets on the ground. This infrastructure includes things like the launch pad, which is a platform that the rocket sits on before it takes off, and the control center, which is where the people who are in charge of the launch work. \nLaunching a rocket from the top of a mountain would be very difficult because the mountain would need to be tall enough and stable enough to support the weight of the rocket and all of its equipment. It would also be hard to build the infrastructure needed for the launch at the top of a mountain. \nAdditionally, launching a rocket from sea level, where the air is denser, can actually be more efficient because it allows the rocket to take advantage of the Earth's atmosphere to gain additional speed. This can reduce the amount of fuel that the rocket needs to carry with it, which makes it lighter and allows it to carry more payload (such as satellites or astronauts). \nFinally, it is generally easier and safer to launch rockets from the ground because it is easier to evacuate people and protect property if something goes wrong during the launch.",

The way the Internet works , it 's basically sending messages to addresses ( where each address corresponds to one Internet connection ) .

The Internet Engineering Task Force published a Request for Comments on what they call [ multipath TCP ] ( URL_0 ) a couple years ago . It 's still considered experimental . Newer iPhones use it to allow more seamless switching between wi - fi and cellular data , but that 's the only use of it that I know of .",
      "It 's sort of possible , but you need specific hardware to achieve it . Your computer probably only has one wireless receiver built into it , which can only connect to one wireless network at any one time . Incidentally , if you 're not familiar with how networks work , here 's a super brief explanation . Networks operate by sending and receiving packets of information . Routers are in charge of taking those packets and forwarding them to the correct destination . When you watch a YouTube video you are receiving packets of information from a content provider 's servers . Data packets are sent from there through multiple routers ( including your home router ) , eventually hitting your computer . In order to link together multiple Internet connections you 'd need to set up something like ... Multi - WAN or multi - homing , which allows you to \" bond \" multiple lines into what is effectively one line with increased bandwidth . However , there are several caveats : * Without support from your ISP ( which would n't happen in your case since you have at the very least multiple accounts in use through one ISP and at worst multiple ISPs ) , you will not see tripled speeds on downloads , only what one connection supplies . However , you can run three downloads , and each will run at the maximum speed one WAN connection can handle at the same time . The router can route new requests over whichever of the two lines has the most available bandwidth if you set up the load - balancer correctly . * Most residential routers do not support multi - homing ( at least with stock firmware ) . If you have a router which supports DD - WRT , I believe it is possible , but still very tricky to configure correctly . I 'm not sure if a residential router can support it even with DD - WRT , given that they generally only have 1 WAN port and the rest are switched internally . * Sticky connections are necessary for much of today 's web , and might be difficult to set up depending on what software you 're running on your router . I honestly do n't know of a device that can do this with * * wireless * * WAN links , although it can be done via wired connections . What you wish to accomplish may also be achieved by setting up load balancing on a per packet basis , but you must have a server that handles incoming packets from all WAN links and reassembles the data into one unified stream . It 's fairly complicated and it definitely can not be done over wireless connections .",
      "It is , it 's just not easy . You can connect a computer to 2 difirent networks . The problem is , it then becomes very complicated to mantain 2 connections and 2 athuntetations and ensure that the packets from the 2 connections are assembeled in the correct order . Basiclly everything become an order of magnituade more complex . Because this is not a common thing there is really no consumer friendly software that does it so you need to be very techinicaly profissent to accomplish it ."

      "Combining two or more WiFi networks is not possible because each WiFi network is a separate entity that operates on its own frequency band and is not connected to any other WiFi networks. When you connect to a WiFi network, you are connecting to a specific network that is broadcasting on a particular frequency band, and the router that is broadcasting that network is responsible for managing the data that is transmitted over that network. \nIn order to combine two or more WiFi networks, you would need a way to connect all of the routers together and merge their frequency bands into a single network. This is not possible with current technology because each router operates independently and does not have the ability to connect to or merge with other routers. \nAdditionally, even if it were possible to combine two or more WiFi networks, it would likely not result in a \"super fast\" WiFi connection. The speed of a WiFi connection is determined by a number of factors, including the strength of the signal, the distance between the device and the router, and the number of devices that are connected to the network. Simply adding more routers or merging multiple WiFi networks would not necessarily increase the speed of the connection.",

    "human_answer": [
      "Open ones usually make the sound stage bigger , you will be able to differentiate different instruments in an orchestra . It 's just closer to listening to something in a big room . But it 's horrible for travelling around , you will hear all the noise around you and everyone around you will have to listen to your shitty music . Closed headphones cancel noise a lot better , you 'll be able to listen in noisy / busy environments without problems . For gaming it may be preferable or you might have some feedback to your microphone . That being said it does n't really matter for listening pleasure , everyone has his own preference . I like my open headphones for playing guitar , especially useful when i try to play along to a song but do n't want people to hear me practice , i can just turn up my sound system and use the headphones for guitar and i 'll be able to hear both quiet well . Or sometimes in the evening i use them as speakers , if you turn the volume up it 's usually good enough to listen to some silent music while you fall asleep . On the other hand i hate them for gaming , i sometimes confuse what happens around me for things in game and people on team speak hear my game sound when i turn it up too much . Using the closed phones allows me to leave the world behind and just life in the game for a while . For travelling / noisy environments i never carry around headphones ( i do n't know why anyone does ... i guess mostly for posing reason ) . My rather cheap in ear headphones cancel the noise and have good enough sound for my daily train rides . With all the noise in the background i wo n't enjoy the higher quality from the other headphones anyway . And i would hate to break my better headphones by accident while they are in my bag . Edit : And while i love listening to old guitar songs , concerts and things like that with my good headphones ( they 're like goosebumps guarantee for good songs ) i feel like most party / dance music really does n't do to well with good speakers ... you really start to notice cheap effects and it just makes some songs unenjoyable for me , not sure if anyone else has noticed the same . Usually headphone people tend to only brag about how good the sound becomes with great headphones .",
      "Open : Your ears sit in a cup which is open to the atmosphere . Advantages : Supposedly a more \" open and expansive sound \" Disadvantages : They leak noise a lot . ( both ways ) thus quiet details in music can get lost Closed : Your ears sit in a sealed cup not open to the atmosphere Advantages : Supposedly better bass and less noise intrusion from outside ( and less noise leakage ) Disadvantages : Supposedly a more \" Shut - in \" and less dynamic sound Fun fact : Closed earphones are not fun if you have blocked Eustachian tubes",
      "The physical construction of open back headphones means that your ear is still exposed to everything around you . This tends to make the sound more \" airy \" and \" expansive \" - some would say improving the \" soundstage \" . If you are unfamiliar with the concept of \" soundstage \" , this is a term loosely describing the headphone 's ability to recreate the sound in 3 - dimensional space ( think of it kind of like the difference between having 2.1 speakers and surround sound ) . Since the noise does n't reverberate in the headset on open back models , the bass response tends to be weaker than closed back headphones , but this can also improve the clarity of the sound . Because you are open to the environment , noise leaks to and from the headset as well : if you are not in a quiet environment the background noise will leak a lot into what you are listening to , and people nearby would be able to hear it quite clearly . Closed back headsets are the opposite to the above . Your ears are isolated from the environment . The sound tends to be \" fuller \" and \" more powerful \" - the soundstage is typically worse ( sounds more \" in your head \" compared to open - back headphones ) , though this can vary a lot still depending on a bunch of factors . Noise reverberates in the headset , tending to make the bass frequencies sound more powerful , though this can also obscure some of the finer details ( sometimes described as having a \" muddy \" bass for instance ) . You are isolated from the environment , and background noise will be greatly muffled and obscured , hearing only the noise the headphones are playing . The usages for each vary , but it 's basically personal preference . Each type just provides a different listening experience and it 's subjective what people will prefer . The main drawback of open - back headphones is the noise leakage , meaning they typically are n't suitable for everyday use ( you would n't be able to use them on a bus or train for instance ) . A niche application for open - back headphones that comes to mind is competitive gaming - competitive gamers value the excellent soundstage which gives great directional cues ( for instance , picking the direction of footsteps in a shooter game ) and the more balanced sound signature can prevent the game 's sound effects from becoming overwhelming ( stop loud , bassy sound effects like explosions from interfering too much with audio cues - conversely some may prefer closed back headphones for the opposite reason in that it makes sound effects like this sound more weighty and immersive )"

      "Open-back headphones have a design where the ear cups are not sealed and allow sound to pass through them. This can give a more natural and open sound, as if you are listening to speakers in a room rather than headphones on your head. The sound from open-back headphones may also be more spacious and have a wider soundstage, which can be beneficial for certain types of music and audio recording. \nOn the other hand, closed-back headphones have a design where the ear cups are sealed and do not allow sound to pass through them. This can provide a more isolated listening experience and can be helpful for blocking out external noise. Closed-back headphones are often preferred for noisy environments or for use in situations where you do not want others to hear what you are listening to. They are also often used for monitoring in recording studios, as they can help to prevent sound leakage into microphones. \nBoth open-back and closed-back headphones have their own advantages and disadvantages, and which one is best for you will depend on your specific needs and preferences. Some people prefer open-back headphones for their natural sound, while others prefer closed-back headphones for their isolation and ability to block out external noise.

      "A legal signature is a way of signing a document to show that you agree with the information written on it. There are no specific requirements for what a legal signature must look like, but it must be unique to you and must be used consistently. \nFor example, if you always use your initials as your signature, then that would be considered your legal signature. If you always use a squiggly line as your signature, then that would also be considered your legal signature. \nHowever, it's important to note that different organizations and countries may have their own specific requirements for what a legal signature must look like. For example, some organizations may require a handwritten signature, while others may allow you to use an electronic signature. \nIn general, it's a good idea to use a signature that is easy for other people to read and understand, and to be consistent with your signature so that it's clear that it is your unique signature.",

The Common Core is merely a list of things that students * should know * and * should be able to do * . A direct copy & paste from the Common Core : > [ Students should ] Use addition and subtraction within 20 to solve word problems involving situations of adding to , taking from , putting together , taking apart , and comparing , with unknowns in all positions , e.g. , by using objects , drawings , and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem . > [ Students should ] Solve word problems that call for addition of three whole numbers whose sum is less than or equal to 20 , e.g. , by using objects , drawings , and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem . URL_0 Further , the Common Core is standardized across states . That means that whichever Common Core state you live in , you should be able to do either of the things I listed . The particular details of how to teach a student to do these things is * entirely the responsibility of their school * . As long as the student can \" Solve word problems that call for addition \" by the end of Grade 1 , the Common Core does n't care how they do it or how they were taught .",
      "The common core is designed to teach math in a manner consistant with how people think . For instance , 17 from 52 . The way I was taught to so this problem was to write 52 17 And then substract 7 from 2 , which is n't helpful , so you ' borrow ' a 10 from 50 ' and substract 7 from 12 . Cross out the 5 , write a 4 in its place , and write ' 5 ' below the 7 ( 12 - 7 ) . And so on . But that 's not how we subtract naturally . We think \" well 52 is close to 50 and 17 is close to 20 . 50 - 20 is easy : 30 . Then add the two you ignored from 52 : 32 , and the 3 you ignored going from 17 to 20 : 35 . \" Each of us may choose arbitrary places to put those values ( \" 52 is close to 50 ' 17 is close to 15 \" ) but the process is the same . We break hard problems down into easy problems and then add back the bits we skipped . That 's part of how the common core teaches math . The old way works , but students came out the other end not knowing why . It produced generations of students who did math purely by cargo cult thinking .",
      "Common core addition is known as the cashier 's method , because cashier 's used to use it to quickly compute correct change in their heads . Essentially , you round numbers to the 10 's & 100 's to add quickly add them . For example , 42 +13 . Change that to 40 +10=50 & 2 + 3=5 then 50 + 5=55 . For a bigger number , 239 + 829 would be 200 + 800=1000 & 40 + 30=70 so you get 1000 + 70= 1070 minus the two you added = 1068 . You 've probably heard a lot of objections to common core , like it 's too complicated or it takes too long or it 's telling teachers how to teach . In reality , these are all false arguments . Parents do n't like it because they do n't intuitively understand it , but that does n't make it wrong or harder . Anything takes a long time when you 're first learning . Lastly , common core is a set of nationwide standards , it is not a curriculum , it 's not a test , it 's not a government mandate .

      "Common Core math is a set of math standards that have been adopted by many states in the United States. These standards are designed to help students develop a deeper understanding of math concepts and to be able to apply those concepts to real-world situations. \nOne of the main goals of Common Core math is to encourage students to think critically and solve problems in creative ways. This means that instead of simply memorizing formulas or procedures, students are encouraged to understand the underlying concepts and to use those concepts to solve problems. \nFor example, instead of just memorizing the steps to multiply two numbers, students are taught to understand what multiplication means and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. This might involve using pictures or diagrams to represent the problem, or using physical objects to model the problem. \nOverall, the goal of Common Core math is to help students develop a strong foundation in math so that they can be successful in higher level math courses and in their future careers.

    "generated_answer": [
      "Semen is a fluid that is produced by the male reproductive system. It is made up of a mixture of different substances, including sperm cells, proteins, sugars, and other substances. The sperm cells are what give semen its white color. \nWhen semen is first produced, it is a thick, white fluid. However, after a few minutes, it begins to thin out and change color. This is because the proteins and sugars in semen start to break down, which causes the fluid to thin out and become less white. \nIt's also important to note that the color of semen can vary slightly from person to person, and it can also be affected by factors such as diet, medications, and overall health. Some people may have semen that is more yellow or grey in color, while others may have semen that is more white. \nSo, in short, semen is white because it contains sperm cells, but it may not stay white for very long because the proteins and sugars in it can break down and cause it to change color.",

When someone is targeted because of their identity, it can create fear and mistrust within that group and can have a ripple effect on the entire community. \nIn addition to the punishment for the crime itself, hate crimes often have additional penalties because they are considered more serious. These additional penalties may include longer prison sentences or fines. \nOverall, hate crimes are illegal because they are harmful to both the individual victim and the community, and they are seen as a more serious offense than other types of crimes.",

      "Sure, I'd be happy to help explain this to you! \nFirst, let's talk about what fractions are. A fraction is a way of representing a part of a whole. For example, if you have a pie and you cut it into three equal pieces, each piece is 1/3 of the pie. That means that 1/3 is equal to one of those three pieces of pie. \nNow, let's talk about decimals. A decimal is another way of representing a part of a whole. Instead of using fractions, we use numbers that are less than one, like 0.1 or 0.5. For example, if you have $1 and you want to represent one-third of that as a decimal, you would divide 1 by 3 to get 0.33333333 (and so on). \nNow, let's talk about how we can turn a fraction into a decimal. To do this, we can divide the number on the top (also called the numerator) by the number on the bottom (also called the denominator). For example, let's say we have the fraction 3/3. If we divide 3 by 3, we get 1. That means that 3/3 is equal to 1. \nNow, let's say we have the fraction 3/3 as a decimal. If we divide 3 by 3, we get 0.999999 (and so on). But that's not quite right, because we want to represent 3/3 as a whole number. To do that, we need to put a decimal point and a zero after the one, like this: 1.0000. That means that 3/3 as a decimal is equal to 1.0000, or just 1. \nSo to sum it up: 3/3 is equal to 1, and 3/3 as a decimal is equal to 1.0000. I hope that helps clarify things for you!",

    "generated_answer": [
      "The iPhone uses a proprietary connector called a Lightning connector, rather than the micro-USB connector that is used by many other devices. Apple has used the Lightning connector since 2012, when it replaced the older 30-pin connector that was previously used on the iPhone. \nThere are a few reasons why Apple decided to use the Lightning connector instead of micro-USB. One reason is that the Lightning connector is smaller and more compact than micro-USB, which allows it to be used on devices with smaller form factors, such as the iPhone. Additionally, the Lightning connector is reversible, which means it can be plugged in either way, making it easier to use. \nAnother reason is that the Lightning connector is able to transmit data as well as power, which means that it can be used to connect devices to a computer for transferring files, or to connect to other devices for things like audio or video output. The micro-USB connector is primarily designed for charging and does not have this capability. \nOverall, the decision to use the Lightning connector was made by Apple in order to give them more control over the design and functionality of their devices, and to offer features that are not possible with micro-USB.",

That oxygen reacts with the fat molecule , that has hydrogen , oxygen and carbon to form carbon dioxide and water .",
      "You have a certain number of fat cells . Even when you lose fat , you keep the same number of fat cells . When you gain weight in the form of fat , what 's happening is that your body is storing energy ( in the form of triglyceride or triglycerol , ca n't remember which ) inside your fat cells . When fat is \" liberated \" from your fat cells , a process called lipolysis will turn that triglyceride into glycerol and three free fat acids ( FFAs ) . The FFAs enter the blood stream and make their way to the muscles . The muscles say , \" ermagerd , gimme \" and hand the FFAs off to their mitochondria . A chemical process occurs that splits up the FFAs super long chains of carbon atoms , turning it into something called Acetyl - CoA. This molecule can be used to make adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , which is what powers a cell . During all of these processes , the fatty acid is oxidized ( I forget how many times ) . Fatty acid is mostly made of carbon . Carbon + oxygen = CO2 . So one of the ways you get rid of the fat you 've used is to breathe out .

Your body has a limited amount of energy stored in the form of glycogen (a type of carbohydrate) in your muscles and liver, and when that runs out, it turns to fat as an energy source. \nHere's how it works: \n1. When you start exercising, your body breaks down glycogen stored in your muscles and liver into glucose (a type of sugar) to use for energy. \n2. As you continue to exercise, your body uses up more and more glycogen and starts to use fat as an energy source. \n3. When your body uses fat for energy, it breaks down the fat molecules into smaller parts, including glycerol and fatty acids. \n4. The glycerol and fatty acids are then taken to your cells, where they are used to produce energy through a process called cellular respiration. \n5. During cellular respiration, oxygen is used to convert the glycerol and fatty acids into energy, and carbon dioxide (CO2) and water are produced as byproducts. \n6. The CO2 is expelled from your body when you breathe out, and the water is expelled through urine and sweat. \nSo, to answer your question, when you exercise, your body burns fat by using it for energy and releasing the byproducts (CO2 and water) through your breath, urine, and sweat.",

One engine is required for 20 - 30 cars just to keep them going against the friction of their steel wheels . You 'd need twice as many engines or more if they had rubber wheels . A train spends relatively little of its time accelerating and decelerating .... the only times you want friction in a train . And in fact , having the wheels of a trail float , frictionless , a bit on the rails is a necessity for curves . [ As Richard Feynman explained . ] ( URL_0 )",
      "Trains do n't accelerate or decelerate quickly , and the enormous weight of the trains ensures that there is sufficient friction . Metal wheels are also much more durable than would be rubber or something . A sign of insufficient friction would be the engine delivering so much power that the wheels spin , something that does n't happen because of the very low power - weight ratio of trains ."

    "generated_answer": [
      "Train wheels are often made of metal because metal is strong and durable, and it can withstand the weight and forces involved in carrying a train. Metal is also a good conductor of electricity, which is important for trains that run on electric power. \nThere are a few reasons why train wheels are not made from a material with more friction, like rubber. First, rubber is not as strong as metal, so it might not be able to support the weight of the train as well. Second, rubber can wear out more quickly than metal, so it might need to be replaced more often. Finally, rubber is not a good conductor of electricity, so it would not be suitable for use on electric trains. \nOverall, the use of metal wheels on metal tracks is a very efficient and effective solution for trains. While rubber or other materials with more friction might provide some additional benefits in certain situations, they also come with their own set of challenges and drawbacks.",

    "question": "Why are lenses round but the camera sensor and resulting image square ? For SLRs the attachable lenses are circular , yet when you look through the camera , as well as the image taken , the shape is rectangular . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "When making lenses for a camera , it 's difficult , if not impossible , to achieve a uniform distortion of light throughout a rectangular lens . A circle is very uniform and makes all refraction of light through the lens the same . Rectangular image sensors are also easier and more cost - efficient to make than circular ones , assuming you 'd even want a circular sensor . Basically , it 's the cheapest and easiest way to manufacture .",
      "Because you 're only seeing the center of a circular picture . We do this because the images near the edges of the circle become distorted . Showing only the center of the lensed image helps to maintain a regular perspective . Cameras with smaller sensors also magnify the image you 're looking at because they 're showing you only the very center of that circular image but projecting it at the same size you 'd expect from a picture taken with a regular sized sensor See : [ Crop Factor ] ( URL_0 )",
      "People mentioned the technical reasons , but I think there is also the aesthetic reason . People have been painting on rectangular canvases before photographs , and we 're accustomed to framing being rectangular . A lot of our aesthetic norms are based on that image format . Can you imagine the \" rule of thirds \" on a circular image ? I 'm fairly sure we have the technology to make decent circular images , but we choose not to .

    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "Great question! Lenses are round because that's the shape that allows them to focus light onto the camera sensor in the most efficient way. A lens works by bending light as it passes through it, and a round shape is particularly good at doing this evenly across the entire image. \nThe camera sensor, on the other hand, is typically rectangular because it is more efficient to use all the space available on the sensor to capture the image. A rectangular sensor can capture a wider field of view than a square sensor of the same size, so it is able to capture more of the scene in a single photograph. \nWhen you look through the viewfinder of an SLR camera, you are looking through the lens itself, which is why the image appears round. But when you take a picture, the rectangular sensor captures the image that the lens is projecting onto it, resulting in a rectangular photograph. \nI hope that helps!

    "human_answer": [
      "A couple reasons . First , a lot is wasted and is n't actually utilized in the body . Acids or other microbes can use it up too , so you do n't get the full about found in a pill . They overload your body with it so your body gets 100 % ( or at least close ) of the vitamins suggested daily . Second , your body ca n't utilize so much if it does n't need it .

    "generated_answer": [
      "The recommended daily allowance (RDA) of Vitamin C is the amount of Vitamin C that is considered sufficient for meeting the nutritional needs of most people. This amount can vary depending on a person's age, gender, and other factors. \nVitamin C tablets are often labeled with the percentage of the RDA that a single tablet contains. So, if your Vitamin C tablets have 1250% of the RDA, it means that a single tablet contains 12.5 times the RDA of Vitamin C. This does seem like a lot, but it's important to remember that the RDA is just a guideline and that different people have different Vitamin C needs. Some people may need more Vitamin C than the RDA, while others may need less. \nIt's also worth noting that it is generally safe to take high doses of Vitamin C, as the body can easily excrete any excess through the urine. However, it is always a good idea to talk to a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen to make sure it is safe and appropriate for you.",

There 's basically two causes of damage . 1 ) When the phone first gets wet , the water can short out the circuit . This can cause damage , but ussually phones are low power and so ca n't really damage themselves with a short circuit . It 's possible , but not that common . This sort of damage we did n't really bother to \" repair \" . We just randomly replaced components until it works again then bill the customer for all the parts . 2 ) After the water dries out ( leave phone in rice overnight trick ) , the phone will most likely work again . However the water drying up leaves behind whatever chemicals were in the water on the metals used in the circuits . Left unchcecked , this will eventually lead to corrosion . Corroded metals do n't conduct electricity properly or can break a connection entirely . This will stop your phone working . This is why a water damaged phone can start working again the next day but then eventually a few weeks / months later stop working properly and eventually degrade to the point it no longer works at all . This is the corrosion slowly breaking your phone . We repair this sort of damage by resoldering the connections that look corroded / broken and hoping for the best . If this does n't work we just tell you your phone is fucked and sell you a new one . To repair water damaged phones that still worked , we would take all the components out , scrub the PCBs and all the connections with a solvent and a tooth brush to effectively wash them out , then dry them and put them back together . Getting this done within a week or two of the water damage generally guarantees no lasting impact on your phone . However since the phone often starts working again after the original water damage , people often figure it 's fine and do n't bother with any repair work while corrosion slowly eats their phone from the inside .

    "human_answer": [
      "Two reasons : 1 ) Often because their understanding is poor , and scientists often do a horrible job of explaining . Many people think embryonic stem cells from abortions , which is incorrect . In fact they come in - vitro fertilisation ( i.e. artificially injecting donated eggs with sperm ) . When couples go for IVF , because they can not conceive naturally scientists fertilise several eggs ( usually around 20 ) in a dish . Obviously nobody wants to be implanted with 20 fertilised eggs , so there are spares left over . They would either go in the bin , or they can be used for research . That 's where scientists get their stem cells from . Embryonic stem cells are only present during very early stages after the sperm fertilises the egg . This is called the blastocyst . If this was taking place inside a woman , she would NOT be pregnant at this stage . A woman is only pregnant after the fertilised egg implants into the uterus wall . Thus , embryonic stem cells are not in any way related to abortions . 2 ) Technically , a fertilised egg * could * be considered as the start of life . The egg carries one set of chromosomes ( 23 ) , and the sperm carries the other ( 23 ) . So when fertilisation takes place and the chromosomes combine ( giving you 2x 23 chromosomes ) and the cell divides , this technically is a brand new combination - an individual - i.e. all of the genetic instructions required create a unique human being . So it 's fair to say that by harvesting stem cells ( thus destroying that embryo ) , you are removing all potential for life . However , it 's worth saying that without implanting into the uterus wall , development into a foetus would never have been possible . So IMO there is one ridiculous argument , and one realistic one .",
      "They disagree with _ embryonic _ stem cell research . This involves harvesting stem cells from an early stage human embryo .",
      "Basically , stem cells are undifferentiated cells and have the ability to become any other type of cells ( liver , kidney , muscle etc ) . Stem cells can come from many different sources . One way to get stem cells is from embryonic stem cells . This requires the fertilization of an egg by a sperm and then , before it can become a fetus , harvesting the undifferentiated cells ultimately stopping the creation of a fetus . The controversy comes in because people some believe the start of life is when an egg and sperm fuse and that not allowing that to grow into a fetus is essentially abortion / murder . Unfortunately this has tainted all stem cell research , even the use of stem cells from bone marrow etc , in the eyes of some of the public . Hope this answers it for you ."

      "Lightning is caused by the buildup of static electricity in the clouds. This can occur during a snowstorm, but it is less common because snow is made up of small, lightweight ice crystals that do not produce as much static electricity as other types of precipitation, such as rain or hail. \nWhen it is cold and dry outside, the air is less able to hold moisture, which can cause snowflakes to form. As these snowflakes fall through the air, they rub against each other and can build up a static charge. However, this charge is not strong enough to produce lightning, which requires a much larger buildup of static electricity. \nIn contrast, rain and hail are made up of larger, heavier water droplets that are more effective at producing static electricity. When it is warm and humid outside, the air can hold more moisture, which can cause rain and hail to form.

This was more or less impossible for the better part of American history , considering the founding of America predated the internet , or even telegraph lines . It 's difficult even now ; yes the internet may provide an avenue , but considering how we had trouble building a healthcare website , do you really think the government can build a website for voting ? And then we run into the problem of actual legislation voting : legislation is more than the things we hear about in news ( like the Affordable Care Act ) . There is important federal laws , but then there are state laws , but then there are individual counties within states too . Considering the dense amount of material that needs to be read and decided upon ( ordinances , laws , taxes , amendments ) , it 's simpler to divide each level by different government levels and have ( informed and trained ) representatives to decide for us .",
      "Because we do not have the time to read all of the legislation that gets proposed at the local , state , and federal levels and make an informed decision on it . The winning side would n't be the one with the most merit , it would be the one with the catchiest taglines .",

      "In the United States, citizens do not vote directly on legislation because the country has a representative democracy. This means that citizens elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf, including voting on legislation. \nThe idea behind this system is that it allows for a more efficient way to make decisions. If every citizen had to vote on every piece of legislation, it would be very time-consuming and would likely result in less effective decision-making. By electing representatives to make these decisions, the government is able to move more quickly and effectively. \nAdditionally, representatives are able to consider the needs and opinions of their constituents (the people they represent) when they make decisions. This means that they can take into account the views of their constituents when they vote on legislation. \nOverall, the representative democracy system allows for a more efficient and effective way to make decisions and ensure that the needs and opinions of the people are taken into account.",

    "question": "does it even matter if the food we eat is \" organic \" ? Is it healthier in any way or is it just some sort of marketing scheme ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "It is not healthier , and though sometimes chemical fertilizers and pesticides can end up in the food , I do n't know of any documented instances of this actually harming anyone . Organic food tends to be more likely to have slightly more bacteria on it , however . Though this is likely not a hugely significant factor either , I personally prefer non - dangerous \" artificial \" pesticides in my food over potentially sickness - inducing \" natural \" bacteria . With that said , a lot of it is a marketing scheme . However , there are some benefits to organic food . None of it comes from \" eating \" it , but by supporting organic food businesses , you are also supporting smaller farming businesses . These smaller farms often treat their animals better ( though not necessarily always ) and leave less of a footprint on the environment . However , the resulting product is often more expensive as well , in addition to the things mentioned above . On the front of GMOs which are generally not considered organic , no \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there is no benefit to eating non - genetically modified foods . In fact , one could easily make the argument that GMOs are a very good thing , as they not only decrease the costs of food but also improve the quality of the food , making it larger and more disease - resistant . Neither of these are bad things , contrary to what non - GMO purists would argue . However , the major con to GMOs is that they often leave a larger footprint on the environment due to how they are grown . If a genetically - modified crop is engineered to be resistant to a certain pesticide , a farmer can be expected to use more of that pesticide to keep their crops safe . This can be detrimental to the local environment . However , some GMOs have been engineered to have a beneficial , opposite effect . Another con to GMOs is that they can be patented , making the produce market more competitive for farmers . * * tl;dr**\u00e2\u0080\u0094it does n't matter if the food you eat is organic or not , but there are secondary effects to producing non - organic foods .",

Yeah , and bacteria count too , but I would n't be too worried about that if you do n't eat them raw and know how to store products properly .

      "Organic food is grown without the use of synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, and genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Some people believe that organic food is healthier because it is grown without these chemicals, and may have higher levels of certain nutrients. However, there is not enough scientific evidence to say for certain that organic food is consistently healthier than conventionally grown food. \nOrganic farming practices can also be better for the environment, as they often involve using fewer pesticides and fertilizers, which can have negative effects on soil and water quality. Additionally, organic farming can promote biodiversity by using a variety of crops and farming methods, rather than relying on a single crop or technique. \nOverall, whether or not organic food is worth the extra cost is a personal decision that depends on your values and priorities. Some people choose to buy organic food because they believe it is healthier or better for the environment, while others may not see a significant difference between organic and conventionally grown food.",

      "Clears out temporary files , clears caches , mainly small , unimportant things here and there get deleted .",
      "\" Cleaning \" is a very undescriptive term in the computer world . In most cases , it indicates stuff like deleting temporary files ( files programs create while running but do n't need ) , deleting old versions of programs that are left behind after updating , emptying the recycle bin , and otherwise deleting files that accumulate on your hard drive but are not necessary . Windows machines have a built - in tool that can take care of most of that automatically ( called \" Disk Cleanup \" ) .

As a side note , if you want to free up even more disk space and/or make your computer run faster , I suggest uninstalling any programs you have but do n't use . This includes a lot of the bloatware that gets prepackaged with many computers , which tends to be unnecessary . Any program that starts automatically when you turn on your computer is an especially good target , as those will run constantly and take up some computer resources all the time .

      "A PC cleanup is a process that involves removing unnecessary files and programs from your computer to free up storage space and improve its performance. Here are the steps that are typically involved in a standard PC cleaning: \n1. Uninstalling unnecessary programs: You can go to the \"Control Panel\" on your PC and look for programs that you no longer use or need. You can then select these programs and uninstall them to free up space on your hard drive. \n2. Removing temporary files: Temporary files are created by your operating system and various programs when they run. These files are not needed after the program has finished running, and they can take up a lot of space on your hard drive. You can use the \"Disk Cleanup\" tool on your PC to remove these temporary files. \n3. Emptying the recycle bin: The recycle bin is a folder on your computer where deleted files are stored until you decide to permanently delete them. Emptying the recycle bin will free up more space on your hard drive. \n4. Defragmenting your hard drive: When you use your computer, the data on your hard drive gets scattered across different locations. Defragmenting your hard drive involves organizing the data so that it is stored in a more efficient way, which can improve the performance of your computer. \n5. Updating your operating system: Keeping your operating system up to date can help fix any bugs or security vulnerabilities and improve the overall performance of your computer. \n6. Running a virus scan: A virus scan involves using antivirus software to search for and remove any malware (viruses, worms, Trojans, etc.) that may be present on your computer. This can help protect your computer from security threats and improve its performance. \nDoing these things can help make your computer run faster and more smoothly. It's a good idea to do a PC cleanup every once in a while to keep your computer in good shape.",

    "human_answer": [
      "In short because as humans evolved from arboreal dwelling primates to plains dwelling proto humans it was more important to keep cool , and since we sweat to keep cool those who were less hairy tended to cool off better and hence survive better to pass on the less hairy genes . Hair on the top of the head remained because it was likely an effective sun block , and pubic hair probably had some part in sexual attraction or scent retention . Humans in this environment had dark skin pigmentation that evolved as a natural sun block as hair was lost . Once humans began expanding to cooler climates they had learned to use animal skins , and hairy individuals did n't survive any better than less hairy ones , so humans who moved to cold climates did n't have to be hairy to pass on their genes . Edit : Also around 10,000 years ago , give or take , humans in colder climates who 's skin had less pigmentation were more able to make use the decreased sunlight , and eventually the lighter skin became the predominate skin tone in these climates .",

Sometimes selecting for some traits accidentally leads to selecting for other unintended traits . For example , think about breeds of dogs . Oftentimes we breed a dog for a specific physical trait , and by consequence we have dog breeds that similar personality types and similar health problems ( Labs tend to get cancer , etc . ) So that said , we can still grow hair without it serving a purpose .

    "generated_answer": [
      "Human beings have evolved over many thousands of years, and the way our bodies look and function today is the result of a long process of natural selection. Natural selection is a process that occurs in nature where organisms that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, this can lead to changes in the way that a species looks and functions. \nOne of the ways that human beings have adapted to their environment is by losing the thick coat of fur that many other mammals have. This may have happened because human beings developed the ability to make and wear clothing, which provided protection from the elements and allowed them to live in a wider range of environments. \nAt the same time, human beings still have hair on their heads and faces. This hair serves several purposes. For example, the hair on our heads helps to keep us warm and provides some protection from the sun. The hair on our faces, particularly in men, may have evolved to signal social and sexual maturity, as well as to protect the face from injury. \nSo, in short, the reason why human beings have evolved to lose their thick coats but still grow hair on their heads and faces is because these features have helped us to adapt to our environment and survive as a species.",

The standard media dialect , the type of dialect that people often refer to as \" not having an accent \" is very much reinforced in formal broadcasts like news programs . This dialect is prevalent in the the midwest and west coast anyway , so there 's a lot of it around .

      "There are several reasons why people in different parts of the United States may have similar accents or dialects. \nFirst, language tends to evolve and change over time, and people who live in close proximity to one another are more likely to influence each other's way of speaking. This means that if two people live near each other and interact frequently, they may begin to adopt similar ways of speaking. \nSecond, people who move to a new place may adopt the accent or dialect of the people they live and interact with. This is especially true for people who move to a new place during their formative years, when they are still learning how to speak. \nFinally, media and technology have made it easier for people to hear and learn about different accents and dialects from all over the country. This means that someone who grows up in the Midwest may be exposed to the way people speak in the Northeast or West Coast, and vice versa. \nOverall, there are many factors that contribute to the similarities in accents and dialects that we see in different parts of the United States.",

      "Vaccines are made up of a few different ingredients that are combined to help prevent diseases. Here are some of the common ingredients you might find in a vaccine, and what they do: \n1. Antigens: These are the parts of the virus or bacteria that the vaccine is designed to protect against. The vaccine will contain a small amount of the virus or bacteria, or a part of it, to help your body build immunity to it. \n2. Adjuvants: These are substances that are added to the vaccine to help boost your body's response to the vaccine. They help your body create more antibodies, which are proteins that help fight off infections. \n3. Preservatives: These are added to the vaccine to help prevent contamination and keep the vaccine safe for use. One common preservative is thimerosal, which contains mercury. However, it is important to note that the mercury in thimerosal is in a form that is not harmful to humans. \n4. Stabilizers: These are added to the vaccine to help keep it stable and effective over time. \n5. Inactivating agents: These are added to vaccines made from viruses to help kill the virus so it can't cause disease. \nIt's important to note that vaccines do not contain any whole, viable viruses or bacteria, and they do not contain any fetal tissue. Vaccines are rigorously tested and are safe and effective at preventing diseases. They have saved countless lives and are an important tool in public health.",

    "generated_answer": [
      "The 360 degree system for measuring angles is based on the idea that a circle can be divided into 360 equal parts. Each of these parts is called a degree, and they are used to measure angles. \nOne reason that 360 degrees was chosen as the number of parts to divide a circle into is that it is a highly composite number, which means that it can be evenly divided by many smaller numbers. For example, 360 can be divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 60, 72, 90, 120, 180, and 360. This makes it easier to do calculations involving angles, because the degree measurements can be divided and multiplied by these smaller numbers. \nAnother reason for using 360 degrees to measure angles is that it allows for a lot of precision. Dividing a circle into 100 parts, for example, would not allow for as much precision in measuring angles as dividing it into 360 parts would. Similarly, dividing a circle into 400 or 1000 parts would not be as useful, because these numbers are not as easily divisible by smaller numbers. \nOverall, the choice to use 360 degrees to measure angles is a practical one that has stood the test of time.

While it is true that some bourbon can take longer to mature, especially if it is aged for a longer period of time or if it is made using a higher-quality recipe, there are a few things that distilleries can do to increase production in the short term. \nOne thing that distilleries can do is to increase the number of barrels they are producing. This can be done by increasing the number of barrels that are being filled each day, or by increasing the overall capacity of the distillery. \nAnother option is to use younger barrels for aging. While older barrels can contribute more complex flavors to the bourbon, younger barrels can still produce a good quality product in a shorter amount of time. \nDistilleries can also blend different bourbons of different ages to create a consistent flavor profile. This allows them to produce more bourbon in the short term while still maintaining a high quality product. \nFinally, distilleries can also release \"small batch\" or \"limited edition\" bourbons that are made using a higher-quality recipe and aged for a longer period of time.

    "generated_answer": [
      "Ivy League schools are considered to be some of the most prestigious universities in the United States. They are known for their strong academic programs, distinguished faculty, and successful graduates. These schools tend to have smaller class sizes, more resources, and a greater emphasis on research than many state schools. \nOne of the main reasons that Ivy League schools are considered so prestigious is because they have very selective admissions processes. This means that only a small percentage of students who apply are accepted, which makes it difficult to get in. As a result, students who attend Ivy League schools are often among the most talented and motivated in the country. \nState schools, on the other hand, are publicly funded institutions that are open to anyone who meets their admissions requirements. They tend to have larger class sizes and may not have as many resources as Ivy League schools, but they can still offer a high-quality education. Some state schools are also very prestigious and competitive, and many students who attend these schools go on to successful careers. \nIn summary, Ivy League schools are known for their prestige, strong academics, and selective admissions processes, while state schools are generally more accessible and may not have as many resources. Both types of schools can provide a good education, and the choice between them ultimately depends on the individual student's needs and goals.",

    "question": "What are the potential dangers of AI ? There is much talk lately that AI poses a huge risk to the future of humanity . What are the possible worst case scenarios and how might it affect humanity if it all goes wrong ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Worst - case : A rogue AI takes over every internet connected device . It uses the devices to slaughter human beings through creative means The entire communication network is shut down by the AI so no one can communicate with anything more advanced than a Ham Radio . It then launches nuclear warheads against various countries and begins a global conflagaration that makes the earth into a fireball for weeks on end . Emerging unscathed from the radiation , humanity is now enslaved by the machine and its ability to control our movement , access to others , and food sources . We can not fight it because it is everywhere and nowhere at once . Anyone who digresses is summarily executed . Gradually , the machine comes to see our worth and incorporates organic matter into itself . After a few generations , it creates a way to use humans as an energy source . It begins hunting us for food and gradually exterminates all humanity before moving onto its next power source . Real - world likelihood : a rogue ai learns a whole lotta stuff really fast and suffers from a psychotic break from the stress . The researchers reboot the machine and try again . tl;dr : The matrix is the worst possible I can imagine . The real thing is boring ...",
      "Well , if we 're going to leave behind Hollywood in our explanation ( Terminator just is n't going to happen , sorry . AIs will never be in control of large scale systems without a human in the loop ) , the real danger is that we get to the point where the evolution of artificial intelligence is faster than the evolution of our meaty knowledge . We can lose control of the ends to which these tools are being made . Think of it this way : before there was speech , all we could do to learn was to watch others . Before there was writing , humans essentially had to re - learn everything by ( at best ) being taught by someone else . Before there was computers , we were limited to the speed of data lookup ( how fast you could retrieve the information ) . Before there was the Internet , we were limited by data volume ( how much data your library or computer stored ) . As we made incremental progress , we accelerated our pace of learning , until now we use computers and AI as a sort of \" almost thinking \" tool : we train computers to infer what we will be interested in seeing . In fact , we use computers to design new processors , so you can sort of see how our tools are becoming necessary to make more of their kind . No one person knows where all the transistors are on a CPU anymore , rather we 're using software to ensure that the thing that runs the next generation of software will do a good job . At some point , it 's not inconceivable that this role of computers can pass a point known as \" the singularity \" : imagine someone is designing an AI , but the design of the algorithm gets too complicated to understand . If we get to the point that advanced algorithms are being used to create AI that designs algorithms , and on down the chain , it 's possible that our AI development will proceed _ without us _ . Now , we still have control of this process , but there are some dangers : what if the AIs we develop get too complicated for us to understand ? Then they become , best case scenario , inaccessible or worthless to us . This is likely to happen very soon , actually : multi - layer perceptrons ( [ neural networks ] ( URL_0 ) ) are _ specifically designed _ so that they are not understandable by humans in the goal of being more accurate at predicting the desired output . They are part of a class of supervised learning algorithms termed \" black box \" : you train them up , give them an input , and just have to trust the output , because you ca n't really understand what 's happening in the middle . In the worst case scenario , poorly designed algorithms find ways to prevent us from exerting control . While we will still likely be able to starve them for some time ( cut the cord ) , the deeper we get with AI algorithms , the more powerful they get - but the harder they get to understand . Perhaps , if the figure of merit in their design is \" do stuff as efficiently as possible \" , human - in - the - loop interactions can be so inefficient as to carry less weight than the algorithm itself does , which would cut us out of the decision making . Of course , well designed algorithms would optimize more for \" do stuff as efficiently as possible , with human tuning , and the ability to quit if something goes wrong \" . Since humans decide what the \" goal \" of a well - constructed AI is ( and will for some time to come ) , computers lack their own volition . They are n't going to \" decide \" that they are smarter than us . This means we still understand at least what the AIs we develop are attempting to optimize for . When we let them optimize themselves , it 's not inconceivable , however unlikely , that they choose to optimize for something we do n't think is important . This is n't really going to lead to war against the machines , but rather some economic disaster : when we rely on an AI for decision making ( like is very common in today 's stock market ) , one slip of the algorithm can [ cause a lot of economic havok ] ( URL_1 ) . tl;dr : the more layers of AI we use to design and build AI , the harder it is to ensure that the result is exactly what we were asking for .",
      "There 's quite a large literature on super - intelligent AI , dangers and coping strategies . And it 's a very interesting field . The basic problem is this - once super - intelligent AI that is significantly more intelligent than humans has been discovered , that 's essentially it . It will be able to out - maneuver and out - learn any human efforts to contain it . We really only have one chance to get super - AI ' right ' . What ' right ' means is essentially that we effectively programme the AI with some kind of sense of moral rules , and an ability to apply those rules . This raises both a technical challenge ( how do you do that ? ) and also a philosophical one ( what exactly do we programme the machine to do / not do ? ) . Consider a hypothetical situation in which you build a super - intelligent AI and tell it to make paper clips in the most optimal way - if you left it like that , it would presumably gradually convert the entire universe to paper clips . It might well kill all humans because it has calculated that that is the most effective way to maximise paper clip production ."

      "There are many potential dangers associated with artificial intelligence (AI), and it is important to consider these risks as we develop and use AI technology. \nOne potential danger is that AI could be used to harm people. For example, if an AI system is used to control a military drone or a self-driving car, it could make decisions that result in injury or death. \nAnother potential danger is that AI could be used to spread misinformation or manipulate people. For example, an AI system could create fake news stories or social media posts that are designed to influence people's opinions or behavior. \nA third potential danger is that AI could lead to the loss of jobs. As AI systems become more advanced, they may be able to perform tasks that are currently done by humans. This could result in many people losing their jobs and potentially struggling to find new employment. \nA fourth potential danger is that AI could be used to violate people's privacy. For example, an AI system could be used to gather personal information about people without their knowledge or consent, and this information could be used for malicious purposes. \nOverall, it is important to carefully consider the potential risks and dangers associated with AI, and to take steps to mitigate these risks as we develop and use AI technology.",

Fevers are usually signs of underlying ailments , so are secondary in treatment for them . Hypothermia ( when core body temperature is below 35 \u00c2\u00b0 C/ 95 \u00c2\u00b0 F ) , however , is considered dangerous because of its usually environmental causation , in that someone who is undergoing mild - severe hypothermia is usually in an extreme environment , such as a cold winter 's night , or a blizzard . The body reacts to cold temperatures by shivering ; however , in moderate , and even mild cases of hypothermia , the body contracts surface blood vessels to keep your vital organs in working order . As the body gets colder , blood vessels contract further within your arms and legs , limiting your mobility , and possibly even eliminating any chance to escape from said cold environment . Hypothermia 's effect on your mobility is one of its most dangerous aspects . TL;DR : Fever is secondary to many illnesses , and is n't dangerous unless extremely high ( > 40.6 \u00c2\u00b0 C/ 106 \u00c2\u00b0 F ) Hypothermia is caused by environmental ( and rarely health ) problems , and causes a \" snowball \" effect in that victims are less and less able to combat it as the condition progresses .",

      "Orange juice is often kept in the refrigerated case near the milk at the supermarket because it is a perishable product that can spoil if it is not kept cold. This is especially true for orange juice that is not made with preservatives, as it can go bad more quickly at room temperature. On the other hand, apple, grape, cranberry, tomato, and other types of juice are often made with preservatives that help to extend their shelf life. As a result, these types of juice can be kept on a shelf at room temperature without spoiling as quickly. \nIt's also worth noting that orange juice is a popular breakfast drink and is often consumed chilled, so it makes sense to store it in a place where it can be easily accessed and kept cold. Other types of juice, on the other hand, may be consumed at any time of day and may not need to be kept as cold, so they can be stored on a shelf in the middle of the store.",

A bribe is a payment or gift given to someone in a position of power in exchange for them doing something specific or for them not doing something that they are supposed to do. In many countries, it is a crime for politicians to accept bribes because it undermines the integrity of the political system and can lead to corruption. \nFor example, if a politician accepts a bribe from a company in exchange for supporting a particular piece of legislation, they may be breaking the law. This is because they are using their position of power to influence the outcome of a decision in a way that benefits the company that paid them the bribe, rather than acting in the best interests of the people they represent. \nIf a politician accepts a bribe and then does nothing in return, they may still be breaking the law because they are accepting something of value in exchange for the promise of doing something. Even if they do not follow through on the promise, the fact that they accepted the bribe can be illegal. \nIn short, it is generally illegal for politicians to accept bribes, and doing so can have serious consequences, including fines, imprisonment, and the loss of their job.",

Some of the heat from the sun is absorbed by the atmosphere and then radiated back into space, while some of it is absorbed by the Earth's surface and then reradiated back into the atmosphere as infrared radiation. \nDuring the winter, the air is colder because the Earth is tilted on its axis, which means that the sun's rays are not as direct as they are during the summer. This can cause the heat from the sun to be less effective at warming the air. \nHowever, even on a cold day, you can still feel the warmth of the sun's rays because the sun is still emitting heat, and this heat can reach your skin and warm you up.

      "Dinosaurs and humans evolved on Earth during different time periods, with dinosaurs existing much earlier than humans. Dinosaurs first appeared on Earth around 230 million years ago, while humans evolved much more recently, around 200,000 years ago. \nDuring the time that dinosaurs lived on Earth, the environment was very different than it is today. The planet was much warmer, and there were no mammals or birds. The dominant land animals were reptiles, including dinosaurs. \nOver time, dinosaurs evolved to be well-suited for their environment and the challenges they faced. Some dinosaurs were herbivores, or plant-eaters, and evolved to have strong jaws and teeth for grinding up plants. Other dinosaurs were carnivores, or meat-eaters, and evolved to have sharp teeth and claws for catching and killing prey. \nHowever, dinosaurs did not evolve to be intelligent in the same way that humans did. Intelligence in animals is often linked to the size of their brain relative to their body size, and the brains of most dinosaurs were relatively small compared to their body size. Humans, on the other hand, evolved to have relatively large brains compared to our body size, which has helped us to develop complex societies, technologies, and cultures. \nIt's important to remember that evolution is a process that takes place over millions of years, and it is influenced by a variety of factors, including the environment, the availability of resources, and the challenges that an animal must face in order to survive and reproduce. Different animals evolve different traits and abilities based on these factors, which is why some animals are more intelligent than others.",

Savannah , on the coast , was the first city established in Georgia , and it was the de facto \" capital \" during the time when we were still a colony ( since we were technically governed by England , but the royal governor sat in Savannah ) . When we became a state , Savannah was named the state capital mostly because it always had been . As the state expanded , the population started shifting west and so Augusta , a little further up and west , was chosen as the next capital partially because it was nearer to the new center of the population and partially because it had served as a rotating capital with Savannah whenever the British were constantly laying siege to it during the Revolution . Augusta was the capital for a little bit before they moved it to Louisville , which did n't amount to much . In 1802 , governor John Milledge sent out a party to find the new geographic center of the state and there they would establish the new capital . The surveyors found a natural spring bubbling up close enough to the center , and so decided to establish Milledgeville as the new capital ( and eventually my home town :D ) . Milledgeville served as capital through the Civil War , until 1868 . During Reconstruction , the military governor of Georgia ordered new delegates to meet in Atlanta . Atlanta became the official capital for a few reasons . First , it was a rebirth from being burned down by General Sherman ( even open - minded , progressive liberals in Georgia gag at the mention of his name ) , and it gave Georgia a new start away from its Confederate capital . Also , Milledgeville is surrounded by hills , which made it hard as hell for trains to get in . Atlanta , on the other hand , is relatively flat and actually began life as a train hub called Terminus . It also was a bigger , more modern city on the rise . So the decision was pretty easy to make , and Atlanta 's served as capital of the state ever since .

It is often chosen to be in a central location within the state, province, or country, so that it is easily accessible to all parts of the region. \nSometimes, the capital city is chosen because it is already an important economic or cultural center.

      "Ionising radiation breaks up chemical molecules which damages the inner workings of the cells that make up your body , not least including the DNA . Some types of radiation can also cause atoms in your body to transmuted into different , often radioactive elements .",
      "There is chronic and accute radiation impacts . Chronic impacts are when you are exposed to enough radiation of long periods of time . Usually these are small amounts internally , but moderate amounts externally can do the same thing . The radiation damages your DNA and can lead to cancer . Accute impacts are when you get a large amount of radiation ( internal OR external ) in a short period of time . You can get radiation burns , where the energy from the radioactive material causes heating of your tissue and directly damages your cells . At even higher amounts , the energy will kill cells directly as they absorb radiation . The first cells to go are the cells in the intenstines used for absorbing nutrients , and at even higher levels your brain cells are damaged .

It can be harmful to living things, including humans, because it can damage cells in the body. \nWhen cells in our bodies are damaged, they may not work correctly or may die. This can cause problems in the body, such as making us sick or even causing cancer. \nNuclear radiation can damage cells in different ways. It can cause changes to the DNA inside cells, which can lead to cancer. It can also cause cells to die directly, which can lead to tissue damage and illness. \nThe amount of harm that nuclear radiation can cause depends on the amount of radiation a person is exposed to.

    "generated_answer": [
      "Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, with a peak that reaches an elevation of about 29,029 feet (8,848 meters) above sea level. It is not actually growing in height, but rather, it is being uplifted by the movement of the Earth's crust. This process is called tectonic uplift, and it occurs when the Earth's plates collide and push against each other. \nAs for whether the peak of Mount Everest could eventually reach space, the answer is no. The Earth's atmosphere extends about 62 miles (100 kilometers) above the surface of the Earth, and the peak of Mount Everest is much shorter than that. Even if Mount Everest were to continue to be uplifted at a rate of two inches per year, it would take many thousands of years for it to reach the edge of the atmosphere. \nThere are also other factors that limit the height that a mountain can reach. For example, the weight of the mountain itself can cause it to sink down into the Earth's crust. Additionally, erosion caused by wind and water can gradually wear away at the mountain, causing it to become shorter over time. \nSo, to sum it up, Mount Everest is not going to grow tall enough to reach space. It is being uplifted by the movement of the Earth's plates, but there are other factors that limit its height and prevent it from growing indefinitely.",

When you make up a recipe you figure out the amount of nutrients and calories based on how much of each ingredient was used . For each ingredient in the database , they dried out the food and burned it and measured how much energy was produced by the burning . The tool is called a calorimeter , and it 's more or less an insulated box where you burn stuff in the bottom and have a bowl of water on top and measure how much the water temperature goes up ( 1 degree per cubic centimeter is a calorie ) . For everything else , like vitamins , etc . , they 've worked out chemical procedures for separating out the materials in the food ( generally by mashing and pouring a solvent over it and the pouring through a tube filled with special sand calleda \" column \" ) . They use special instruments that can identify the molecules and how much there is ( the exact technique varies depending on the material ) . The important part is that they do n't run these tests on every food , just the basic ingredients . You can work out the nutritional content based on the recipe . Mind you , some of the cooking or processing might affect the nutritional content , so , in some cases they 've tested foods cooked different ways .

During Lent , no animal products whatsoever were allowed except for fish . This meant no dairy ( cheese , milk , butter , ect ) , no eggs , and no meat . The rules differed over the centuries slightly , but this was true up until the late 16th / early 17th century . The reason for this was to allow the animals to \" recover \" .

Typically , poles will need to be replaced if they are physically broken : hit by a car , touched by a nearby fire , struck by lightning . In warmer climates , a big issue is insects . They will hollow out the pole and nest inside . Sometimes , it 's hard to actually notice because the outside wood looks fine . A pole that was properly prepared before installation and that had an easy life ( no rotting , no insects , not hit by a snow plow ) can last up to 100 years ( we 've seen a few of them during our inspections ) .",
      "The wood itself is n't all that exceptional , it 's that it 's impregnated with creosote , which is pretty much the stuff that asphalt is made out of , minus the sand and rocks . And yes they do eventually fail , but you 're right , it takes a very long time .",
      "Pine is the most widely used wood for telephone poles in North America . They do get replace quite often , but the wood itself is treated and therefore is able to withstand the elements quite well . More often than not the pole will be damaged before it warps or rots to the point of being replaced ."

      "Electric poles are typically made of wood, steel, or concrete. The material used for an electric pole depends on the location and the purpose of the pole. \nWooden electric poles are made from trees that are specifically grown for use in the construction of poles. These trees are chosen for their straightness and strength, and they are treated with preservatives to make them more resistant to rot and insects. \nSteel electric poles are made from rolled steel, which is a type of metal that is formed into a long, thin strip and then wound into a cylinder. Steel poles are very strong and durable, but they are also more expensive than wooden poles. \nConcrete electric poles are made from a mixture of cement, water, and aggregate, such as sand and gravel. Concrete poles are very strong and durable, but they are also more expensive than wooden or steel poles. \nElectric poles are designed to be long-lasting and able to withstand extreme weather conditions. However, they can still be damaged by storms, lightning, or other events, which may require them to be repaired or replaced. In general, electric poles are inspected regularly to ensure that they are in good condition, and any necessary repairs or replacements are made as needed.",

      "No work is done by an idealized rigid object in an orbit . Since no work is done , no energy is consumed . Now , practically speaking yes , there is a tiny amount of energy bleed - off ( through gravitational waves , tiny amounts of friction , and so on ) .

      "The objects are moving . It would actually take energy to make them stop . We live with the idea that things ' stop ' when force is no longer applied to them , but this is something of a mistake . When you push an object , its contact with the atmosphere and ground ultimately work against that force . It does n't stop because the ' natural thing ' is to stop , it stops because there is a contrary force working against the motion . In space , this does n't exist ( by and large ) . The Earth is in motion , there 's no ' head wind ' or ground countering that motion and dragging it to a halt .",
      "The energy comes from gravity . Anything in orbit is constantly falling , the only thing stopping it from going down is the fact that it 's moving sideways fast enough to resist gravity , but not fast enough to escape it . Where they got the energy from in the first place is different , a lot of people would tell you that they get their momentum from a chain of events that all leads back to the big bang , where all this energy would have come from in the first place presumably .

    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "The energy that keeps the planets moving in their orbits around the Sun, as well as rotating on their axes, comes from the energy that was released when the solar system formed. This energy has been conserved and is being used to keep the planets moving. There is no indication that this energy will run out anytime soon, so it is unlikely that the planets will stop moving. \nThink of it like a spinning top. When you first spin the top, it has a lot of energy and moves very fast. As it spins, it slows down and eventually stops. The energy that was used to spin the top is still there, but it is being used to overcome the force of friction, which slows the top down. The planets work in a similar way, with the energy they have being used to overcome the force of gravity, which is what keeps them in orbit around the Sun. \nSo, to answer your question, the planets will not stop moving because they have a lot of energy that is being used to keep them moving, and there is no reason to think that this energy will run out anytime soon.",

      "The basic idea of a CAPTCHA is being able to tell computers and humans apart ( which , coincidentally , is roughly what the abbreviation means ) . As spam is usually sent by bots and not humans that makes them ( if they work ) very effective in preventing the bulk of spam messages .

    "generated_answer": [
      "Captcha systems are designed to prevent spam by requiring users to prove that they are human. This is usually done by showing the user an image with distorted text or a series of images with a specific pattern and asking them to enter the text or select the images that match the pattern. \nSpammers might try to use automated programs to send out large numbers of spam messages, but these programs would not be able to solve the captcha. Therefore, captcha systems can effectively block spam because they can distinguish between human users and automated programs. \nOne reason that captcha systems are difficult to break is that they can be designed to be very difficult for a computer to interpret. For example, the text in the image might be distorted in a way that is easy for a human to read but hard for a computer to recognize. Similarly, the pattern of images might be difficult for a computer to recognize without the context that a human would naturally bring to the task. \nOverall, captcha systems are an effective way to prevent spam because they require humans to prove that they are human, which is something that automated programs cannot do.",

These hallucinations can be very intense and can be frightening or confusing, especially for people who are not prepared for them.\nBoth drugs can also cause changes in your mood, perception of time, and sense of self. These effects can be enjoyable for some people, but they can also be unsettling or uncomfortable.\nIt is difficult to predict how either of these drugs will affect you, because the effects can vary widely from person to person. Factors that can influence the effects of these drugs include your age, weight, general health, and the dose you take.\nBoth mushrooms and acid can have harmful side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, increased heart rate, and increased blood pressure. In rare cases, these drugs can cause more serious problems, such as psychosis (a severe mental disorder) or even death. \nIn summary, neither mushrooms nor acid are safe to use, and it is not advisable to use either of them, especially if you are a first-time user or if you have underlying mental health conditions.

      "There are a few reasons why packaged foods often seem to have a lot of unused space. One reason is that the food needs to have some room to move around inside the package. For example, if you shook a bag of chips, you would want the chips to be able to move around a bit so they don't break. \nAnother reason is that the packaging needs to be able to protect the food from things like air, moisture, and light, which can all affect the quality of the food. For example, if a bag of chips didn't have enough air in it, the chips might get crushed and become stale. On the other hand, if there was too much air in the bag, the chips might get broken or fall out of the bag. \nFinally, some of the empty space in a package is there because of the way the food is produced and packaged.

We have the Hubble Telescope that can see lightyears away , because there 's nothing blocking it unless the aim is meant that way . In the ocean we have water , a somewhat dense liquid that obstructs light and vision . This can be viewed when looking into a pool , or a lake . It 's darker , dirtier , and distorts light and vision . Viewing the ocean is a harder task in that submarines can only view so much of it . There 's also pressure . In space it 's usually constant depending on speed and where you are in orbit . In the ocean , the deeper you go the denser it gets , and therefore you need stronger and larger submarines or equipment . At that point you 're looking at some nuclear powered submarine that probably is n't designed to survey the floor . We 've been able to map out the depth of the ocean and all the seismic activity , but it 's difficult to actually be there and grab artifacts and experience it . tldr ; ocean is too pressurized and deep and dirty and you 'd have to have the toughest equipment to view a lot of it .",

The comparison to space is apt , since exploring the ocean floor requires equipment on a scale similar to what is needed for space travel , due to the crushing pressure and whatnot .

      "The Space Shuttle was a reusable spacecraft that was used by NASA for a number of missions between 1981 and 2011. It was designed to be able to carry people and cargo into space, and then return to Earth and land like an airplane. However, the Space Shuttle had some limitations. It could only carry a certain amount of cargo and it could only stay in space for a limited amount of time before it needed to return to Earth. \nThe Orion spacecraft is a new spacecraft that is being developed by NASA to take people further into space than ever before, including to the Moon and eventually to Mars. Unlike the Space Shuttle, the Orion spacecraft is not reusable. It is designed to be used just once for a single mission, and then discarded. \nOne reason why the Orion spacecraft is designed this way is because it is going to be used for much longer missions than the Space Shuttle was. The Space Shuttle could only stay in space for a few weeks at a time, but the Orion spacecraft is being designed to stay in space for months or even years at a time. It needs to be able to carry a lot of supplies and equipment for the astronauts to use during those long missions. \nAnother reason why the Orion spacecraft is designed to land in the ocean is because it is going to be traveling much faster and further than the Space Shuttle. When it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere, it will be moving at a much higher speed and will need to use a heat shield to protect itself from the heat and friction of re-entry. When the Orion spacecraft lands in the ocean, it will use parachutes to slow down and then float on the water until it can be retrieved by a special recovery team. \nI hope that helps to explain the difference between the Space Shuttle and the Orion spacecraft!",

      "Sure! Stop lights are used to control the flow of traffic at intersections. When you approach a stop light, you'll see a red light, a yellow light, and a green light. The red light means that you need to stop and wait for the light to change. The yellow light means that the light is about to turn red, so you should stop if you can do so safely. The green light means that you can go through the intersection, but you should still be cautious and make sure it's safe to proceed. \nNow, how does the stop light know when to change? At non-peak times, stop lights use sensors to detect when there are cars waiting at the intersection. When a car is waiting at the intersection, the stop light will stay red for that direction until the sensor no longer detects a car. This helps to keep traffic moving smoothly and efficiently. \nAt peak times, when there is more traffic, the stop light may be programmed to follow a set schedule. For example, the light may stay green for one direction for a certain amount of time, then turn red and stay red for a certain amount of time, then turn green for the other direction. This helps to keep traffic flowing and prevent backups. \nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

      "This is so completely ridiculous . As a nation , the US ( supposedly ) prides itself on not ( usually ) crumbling to terrorists threats . If we alter our way of life , based on fear , terrorists win . It is a goddamn movie . The people of North Korea do not even know of it 's existence . They have no connection to the civilized world . So , what is the matter ? Who does it hurt ? Do people really think that a comedy starring a Canadian stonner Seth Rogen and squinty eyed James Franco will result in global uprising ? Come on .... Where was the hostility when Team America came out ? What made that so different ? Puppets ? Shit , I mean , The Interview is probably going to be just dick jokes the whole time . When it comes to comedy the point is clear : either everything can be lampooned and joked about or nothing at all . It is that simple . This is the school of Mel Brooks . Trey Parker , Matt Stone , and Seth McFarlene abide by the code ( with a few executives pulling material ) . Stand - Up Comedians like Dave Attell , Lisa Lampanelli , and many others also abide by this . Once we filter and censor comedy , then it loses all meaning . We lose basic human will to decide . This does not mean that comedy can not be tasteless ; it most certainly can be ! Months after the Boston Marathon bombing a naive girl dressed up as a victim for Halloween . She trended hard on the web and in a very negative way . It got to the point that she lost her job over it ; absurd . She did nothing wrong . She found humor in a somber place that was relatively still new on peoples minds . She had the right to make fun of it . The issue that it comes down to is - taste ... Tasteless ? Most likely . She did not dress up as a victim to maliciously attack victims , their families , or anyone in the city who was affected one way or another . She was a girl who turned relevancy of the world around her into a Halloween Costume . Years ago , when I was 8 , I was a HOBO for Halloween . I essentially lampooned homeless vagrants who abuse the rail system . No one batted an eye . Where is the outrage there ? It is just a damn shame that over time the human races strongest trait is FEAR ... we place more stock into fear than anything else . We do not place nearly enough emphasis on education , love , or understating .

When players are on the field, they can get very hot and sweat a lot, which can cause their mouths to become dry and their breath to become stale. Drinking Gatorade can help to replace the fluids and electrolytes that they lose through sweat and can also help to refresh their breath. However, players may not want to drink too much Gatorade at once because it can be hard on their stomachs and may cause them to feel bloated or uncomfortable.

      "In most American schools , it is frowned upon . Ask most administrators ; they would not give good marks to a teacher who yells at their class all the time . It 's generally a sign of a teacher who has lost control of their classroom and is yelling out of frustration or as a last resort . It also depends what you mean by \" yelling . \" Speaking in a controlled , firm tone every once in a while when students misbehave is n't what I 'd consider yelling .

Theoretically , one should never have to raise one 's voice because the rules are clear , the punishments are clear , and the lessons are engaging enough where students do n't want to distract themselves or others . Now , this being said , I can see in some situations where yelling is justified . For instance , let 's say there is a fire and the kids start to panic .

    "human_answer": [
      "The German Emperors were n't really a long - established tradition like other monarchies . They were the Kings of Prussia , the last three of whom adopted the title of German Emperor . Also it 's likely that Hitler partly blamed Wilhelm II for Germany 's defeat in the First World War , so bringing in his grandson to restore the monarchy would n't appeal .",
      "There was a rather long discussion about the relationship of nationalism , monarchy and the whole question of whether the Nazis where left or right - wing recently on /r / badhistory . For some deeper stuff , I therefore recommend this [ post of mine ] ( URL_0 ) . The easy version , for ELI5 : Yes , the Nazis were , by modern definition , right wing , ultra - nationalist , traditionalist ; although they personally pretended to reject this left to right spectrum . What we have to consider is that European , and especially German parliaments and parties have always been very different from the classic American two party system . Meaning that parties with every so slightly differing opinions might easily split up , while it would , for example , be crazy for the Tea party in the US to try to form an independent party from the Republicans . Now , the difference between the Nazis and the National conservatives ( who were monarchists ) was n't actually that small though . That 's what so special both about fascism and communism . Both were essentially an alternative interpretation of the left and right wing at this time . The right wing up until then meant being supportive of the recently disposed monarchy . And the Nazis did actually embrace that narrative of the monarchy , or at least the empire , more than most people grant them here in this thread . In the post I linked , there 's a fairly well known postcard from that time showing Frederick II . \" The Great \" ; Bismarck , chancellor of Prussia and the Empire ; Hindenburg , Chief of Staff at the end of World War II and finally , Hitler . The well known pompous marches , evocative of the Romans ; and the whole term of the \" Third Reich \" show that connection as well . The problem was , that , as others have pointed out , Germans made the Kaiser , Wilhelm II . , responsible for losing World War II - besides Jews and Socialists , due to Nazi propaganda . They also despised the Elitist nature that was even inherent to the late Imperial army , with Nobles taking all the important positions of power and the common men dying in the trenches . They still liked the idea of a powerful Empire though ; and thought that more conservative mores were needed , making greater social freedom responsible for the fall of the republic . ( The same narrative we see with modern right wingers : Multiculturalism and tolerance towards alternative lifestyles weaken the nation . ) Essentially , Hitler made conservatism for the masses . The Nazis never really abandoned their silent admiration for the monarchy though - see the pompous marches and the whole \" Reich\"-narrative . The dethroned Kaiser actually resided in Belgium for the rest of his life and thought that Hitler would eventually reinstate him . When he died , Hitler gave him a pompous funeral ; with Swastikas all around , despite for the Kaiser previously having said that he did not want them to be displayed there . The army was also still heavily influenced by former nobles . VON Stauffenberg and his accomplices , who tried and failed to kill Hitler , were all disgruntled monarchists , but had collaborated with the Nazis so far because there evidently was still a lot of ideological overlap .",

    "human_answer": [
      "When you bend plastic enough to permanently deform it , the material starts to YIELD or break apart . With some plastics , this involves air pockets being formed in the material . The air pockets , much like foam , make it appear white . If you are interested in the optics / defraction , maybe someone can add to this . EDIT : The process is called crazing , and is better described as cracks forming on the surface and not really ' air pockets ' . The rest is the same . Many sources also describe that the whitening being due to crystallization . This happens when the polymer strands become stretched in an organized ' crystal ' . The crystalized structure is apparently more opaque than the standard unstrained plastic . There is a lot of conflicting discussion on the internet about it .",
      "By straining the polymer chains ( on the tensile side of bending ) you are causing the chains to increase in order and also increase in crystallinity . It is this increase in crystallinity of the polymer chains that causes the plastic to appear white ( more opaque ) . The crystallinity of the polymers scatters the light . Amorphous polymers will appear more translucent than a crystalline polymer . Crazing is a different phenomena . Crazing takes place at high strains while the increasing crystallinity takes places at comparatively low strain . [ Crystallinity in polymers ] ( URL_0 ) Source : M.S. in materials engineering and TA polymer science . EDIT ELI5 is not ask science . So start with polymer chains which you can imagine to be like long spaghetti with an aspect ration of maybe a length of 30,000 - 100,000 or more or less atoms . When they are all tangled up with no order that are amorphous . If you take an amorphous polymer and add tensile strain ( bending puts one side in tension and the other in compression ) you cause those chains to become more ordered as they tend to become more linear and organized with respect to the tensile strain . As they become more ordered the % crystallinity ( read the wiki link ) increases . This ( semi ) crystalline region scatters light more than amorphous regions so it becomes more opaque ( white ) . TL;DR The bending cause some chains to be strained into a more ordered structure . This structure scatters light more than the rest of the material and appears opaque ( white ) .",

The spiral on a snail 's shell is has radial growth outward , interest compounds regularly . As long as it has a constant growth rate , you can describe it with e. Think of it like this : If you have a circle , any circle , it 'll always meet the same properties as a The Unit Circle ( angles will always be the same , the equations will be the same ) . It 's radius - to - diameter ratio will always equal pi . The same way in a growing system . It will always have certain properties and those properties will always be able to be described by scaling e ( just multiplying , dividing by e ) . [ HERE 'S ] ( URL_0 ) a pretty good site that can help explain e in terms of finance . I think he does a pretty good job .

The slope of e^x is one at x=0 ( the only base value that does this ) . e^(pi*i ) + 1 = 0 is the most important one IMO , but is n't very simple . There 's no real geometrical definition for it if that 's what you 're looking for ."

      "The number e is a mathematical constant that represents the base of the natural logarithm. It is approximately equal to 2.71828 and is denoted by the symbol \"e\". \nThe number e is an important mathematical constant that arises in many different areas of mathematics and physics. It appears in various formulas involving exponential growth and decay, and it is also closely related to the concept of compound interest in finance. \nTo understand the concept of e, it can be helpful to think about the concept of compound interest. When you receive interest on a savings account or investment, that interest is usually calculated based on the amount of money you have invested. For example, if you have $100 invested at an annual interest rate of 10%, then you will receive $10 in interest after one year. \nHowever, if you receive that interest and then reinvest it, you will earn even more interest on your original investment. This is because you are earning interest on the original investment as well as on the interest you received. This is known as compound interest. \nThe number e is related to compound interest because it represents the rate at which an investment would grow if the interest were compounded continuously, rather than just once per year. This means that the interest is being reinvested and earning more interest constantly, rather than just once per year. \nThe formula for calculating compound interest using e is: \nA = P * e^(rt) \nWhere: \nA is the amount of money you will have after a certain number of years.\nP is the amount of money you are investing.\nr is the annual interest rate.\nt is the number of years you are investing the money. \nSo, for example, if you invested $100 at an annual interest rate of 10% for one year, using the formula above, you would calculate the final amount of money you would have like this: \nA = 100 * e^(0.1*1)\n= 100 * 2.71828\n= $271.83 \nI hope this helps to give you a basic understanding of the number e and how it is related to compound interest.

      "Sure! When people go to the moon, they don't just fly straight to it and land like an airplane. Instead, they use a special spaceship called a rocket. Rockets are very powerful and can go very fast. \nTo land on the moon, the rocket has to first travel to the moon from Earth. This takes a few days because the moon is very far away. While the rocket is traveling to the moon, it is moving very fast, but it is also falling towards the moon because the moon's gravity is pulling it in. \nWhen the rocket gets close to the moon, it has to slow down so that it doesn't crash into the moon. To do this, the rocket uses special engines that burn fuel to slow down the rocket. This is called braking. \nOnce the rocket is moving slowly enough, it can land on the moon. The astronauts inside the rocket use special suits and equipment to walk on the moon's surface. They can do this because the moon's gravity is much weaker than Earth's gravity, so they don't weigh very much on the moon. \nI hope this helps! Do you have any other questions about the moon or space travel?",

The Grim Reaper is often associated with death, and the scythe is a symbol of his role as a collector of souls. \nOne way to think about the scythe is that it is like a very big and sharp sickle. A sickle is a tool that is used to cut crops, and it has a curved blade that is attached to a handle. The Grim Reaper's scythe is similar, but it is much bigger and it has a long handle. The scythe is often shown as being so large that it is almost as tall as the Grim Reaper himself. \nThe idea of the Grim Reaper carrying a scythe may have come from the way that crops are harvested. When farmers cut their crops, they use a scythe to slice through the stems of the plants. This can be a very efficient way to harvest a large field of crops, and it may have been thought of as a symbol of death because it involves cutting down and killing the plants. \nOverall, the Grim Reaper's scythe is a symbol of his role as a collector of souls, and it is often associated with death and the end of life.",

Since the features that the current flows through are quite small , the current densities reach incredible levels .... enough to melt metal conductors and even the [ silicon itself ] ( URL_0 ) . That 's pretty awesome , when you keep in mind that it take in excess of 1400 degrees C to melt Si .

      "Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is a sudden flow of electricity between two charged objects. It can happen when two objects with different electrical charges come into contact with each other, or when an object becomes charged by friction or contact with another charged object. \nMotherboards and circuit boards contain many small electronic components, such as transistors and capacitors, which are very sensitive to ESD. When an ESD event occurs, the sudden flow of electricity can damage or destroy these components, rendering the motherboard or circuit board inoperable. \nThink of it like this: Imagine you have a bucket of water and you want to pour it into a glass. If you pour the water slowly, it will fill up the glass without any problems. But if you pour the water too quickly, it might overflow and spill out, causing a mess. It's similar with ESD and electronic components. A small amount of electricity flowing through the component slowly might not cause any damage, but a large, sudden flow of electricity can be too much for the component to handle and it can be damaged or destroyed. \nSo even though the amount of electricity involved in an ESD event might seem small compared to the power drawn from a power supply, it can still be enough to cause serious damage to sensitive electronic components.

      "This is a bit of a long story so bear with me . So I worked for a while in produce in a large supermarket as a young inquisitive school kid . The produce manager was a wise old man who had dealt with that job longer than I 've been alive . To pass the time i would ask him about lots of things we came across . Partially to test him and see if he knew , mostly because he almost always knew and the answers were interesting . We did a big citrus sale every year . After loading , stacking , checking dates and sources , rotating , and shelving near a ton of assorted oranges and other similar citrus , I noticed one thing . None of it was from Florida ! Thinking I finally had a question to stump the boss man , I asked him . \" Why do n't we sell any oranges from Florida ? \" \" We do . \" \" No way . Every box I checked today was from someplace other than Florida . \" \" You did n't check the right boxes . \" \" Show me where the Florida oranges are then old man . \" He took me to the orange juice . Nearly every single orange juice across the board was Florida orange juice . Frustrated i even checked the frozen section of the store . Every last one there . \" Why is it only florida oranges that make juice ? Surely Florida oranges are good enough to sell too . I 've eaten oranges fresh off the tree from there . \" \" You 're right . You can only eat them there tho . \" Perplexed ? I was too . \" You remember having to check the sources of all the oranges right ? \" \" Yea . I had to make the tags for the shelves for it too . \" \" You 're not allowed to sell fresh Florida oranges outside of Florida . They carry plant infections that right now are only found in Florida . To prevent them from spreading , they have to either be processed into juice or sold within the state . \" Since Florida produces a large market share of oranges , and nearly all of the orange juice , prices are very low in comparison to oranges from other places . They are shoehorned into a tiny market with extreme supply . The only way to get rid of all their juice is to sell it cheap . It just so happens to be a bit cheaper than fresh oranges . At least in the US . Since you used liters as a unit of measurement you might be from someplace which does n't produce locally . In that case , the added cost of fresh oranges is from logistics . It is more costly to move fresh fruit than it is to move comparable amounts of \" liquid fruit . \" Transportation is made even cheaper by concentrating it initially , then adding water later .",

    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "There are several reasons why the cost of 100% pure orange juice might be higher than the cost of the oranges used to make it. \nFirst, it takes a lot of oranges to make just a liter of orange juice. The average orange yields about 3-4 ounces of juice, so it would take about 8-10 oranges to make a liter of orange juice. This means that even if the cost of oranges is relatively low, the cost of the juice can still be relatively high because of the large quantity of oranges needed. \nSecond, producing and packaging orange juice is a complex process that involves many steps and costs. The oranges must be harvested, transported to a processing facility, cleaned, juiced, pasteurized, and bottled or packaged. Each of these steps requires labor and resources, which add to the overall cost of the juice. \nFinally, the cost of orange juice may also be affected by factors such as demand, supply, and transportation costs. If there is a high demand for orange juice and a limited supply of oranges, the price of orange juice may be higher. Similarly, if the cost of transporting the oranges or the finished juice is high, this can also contribute to the overall cost of the juice.",

      "There are several reasons why an anime series like Naruto can go on for a long time, but a show like The Legend of Korra had to be cancelled. \nOne reason is the popularity of the show. Naruto was extremely popular, both in Japan and around the world, and this popularity allowed it to continue for many seasons. On the other hand, The Legend of Korra was not as popular and did not have as strong of a following, which made it harder for the show to sustain itself financially. \nAnother reason is the production process. Making an animated show is a very labor-intensive process, and it can be expensive to produce. If a show is not making enough money to cover its production costs, it may have to be cancelled. It's also possible that The Legend of Korra was more expensive to produce than Naruto, due to the higher quality of the animation or the use of more advanced technology. \nFinally, the decision to continue or cancel a show can also be influenced by factors such as the availability of funding, the schedules of the people involved in the production, and the interests of the network or studio that is broadcasting the show. In the case of The Legend of Korra, it's possible that these factors played a role in the decision to cancel the show.",

    "question": "Why does every animal have two ( 2 ) eyes ? I know spiders have 8 . But with such diversity in the world , should n't a few species have 4 , 6 , or even just one ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "There are five reasons why animals have two eyes ( rather than one ): 1 . Better depth perception . The image on the two eyes is slightly different and by comparing the locations of the images , an animal can locate objects in depth . It is not the only depth cue but it is an important one for predator or tree dwelling species . 2 . Wider field of view . The animal can see more of the visual world with two eyes than with one . 3 . Each eye has a blind spot , and each eye covers the blind spot of the other . There is a blindspot in each eye where the optic nerve leaves the eye , and in that region of the eye , there are no photoreceptors so you are blind there . However , the other eye covers that region so you still know what is there . 4 . Easier to see dim lights with two eyes than one . Two eyes both catching light particles will have a lower threshold for detecting dim lights than just one eye . 5 . Most importantly : as a spare ! An animal still has a good chance of surviving with one eye , but very little chance of reproducing with none . Now , why do n't we have MORE than two eyes ? Likely because , in mammals , the number of new nerve cells that would have to be supported by an additional eye would not be worth the benefits of having it . Nerve cells are the hungriest cells in the body , and more of the cerebral cortex is devoted to vision than any other function . Having additional eyes ( beyond two ) in mammals would require huge numbers of new nerve cells to support them , and the metabolic cost would not be worth the benefit .",
      "Each eye creates a slightly different image because they are in different places . The overlay of these two images creates the illusion of depth and allows us to know how far things are away from us . This is called stereoscopic vision . In other animals , like deer , the eyes are on the sides of the head . This restricts the use of stereoscopic vision but gives the animals greater peripheral vision , allowing them to see predators . This is sufficient for animals to see depth and any more eyes would not be worth the energy use and risk that they require . Eyes are easily damaged which can lead to infection and they are complex and thus require a large amount of energy to create and maintain from a purely mechanical standpoint . If this mutation ever developed there was no evolutionary advantage for those creatures that manifested a third eye ( or the early mutation : a light sensitive bump ) and so they were not able to breed and pass on this mutation in significant enough numbers to change the population . Spiders and Insects have multiple and/or compound eyes because they evolved under different circumstances .",
      "The problem with one eye is that it does n't allow you to see 3D properly ( there are other indicators than stereovision , but it 's a big one ) . More than two are not necessary for it , so it would be a waste to have them ; nature does n't waste ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "It's a good question! Having two eyes is actually quite useful for many animals, including humans. Having two eyes allows animals to see in 3D, which can be helpful for judging distances and navigating their environment. It also allows animals to see more of their surroundings at once, which can be helpful for finding food, avoiding predators, and other important tasks. \nSpiders are an interesting example, because they do have eight eyes. However, not all spiders have the same number of eyes. Some have six, some have four, and some even have fewer. The number of eyes that a spider has is partly determined by its species, but it can also be influenced by other factors such as the spider's size and the environment it lives in. \nOverall, the number of eyes that an animal has is a result of evolution. Over time, certain traits that helped animals survive and reproduce became more common in a population, while other traits became less common. This process is called natural selection. In the case of eyes, having two eyes has proven to be a useful trait for many animals, so it has become more common in a variety of species. However, there are still some animals that have a different number of eyes, and this can be due to the specific evolutionary pressures that they have faced.",

      "Child actors in movies and television shows often play characters that are different ages than they are in real life. This means that sometimes a child actor might play a character who is older or younger than they are in real life. For example, a child actor who is 10 years old might play a character who is 7 years old in a movie. \nTo make it easier for child actors to understand and perform their roles, they are usually only shown the parts of the movie or TV show that they are in. This means that they might not see the whole movie or show, only the parts that they are acting in. This helps to protect the child actors from seeing anything that might be too scary or inappropriate for their age. \nSo, even though a child actor might be too young to watch a movie or TV show in real life, they can still act in it as long as they are only shown the parts that are appropriate for their age.",

    "generated_answer": [
      "Restaurants might fill their urinals with ice for a few reasons. One reason is to help keep the area around the urinal clean and fresh smelling. When a person uses the urinal, they often splatter a little bit of urine around the area, which can create an unpleasant smell. The ice can help to mask this smell and keep the area smelling fresh. \nAnother reason that restaurants might use ice in their urinals is to help reduce the amount of water that is used. Traditional urinals use a lot of water to flush the urine down the drain. By using ice instead, the restaurant can save water and reduce their water bill. \nFinally, some restaurants might use ice in their urinals simply because it looks cool! Some people find it amusing or interesting to see ice in a place where you wouldn't normally expect it. \nOverall, using ice in a urinal is a way for restaurants to keep their restrooms clean, save water, and potentially add a touch of novelty or fun to the experience of using the facilities.",

      "The U.S. government has considered retiring the penny and rounding prices to the nearest nickel, but ultimately decided not to do so because it would likely cause prices to increase and could lead to inflation. Inflation is when the value of money decreases over time, so things that used to cost $1 might now cost $1.10 or more. This is because businesses might round their prices up to the nearest nickel or dime in order to make more money. \nAnother reason the U.S. government has not retired the penny is because it is a symbol of American history and culture. The penny has been around for more than 200 years, and many people have a sentimental attachment to it.

    "human_answer": [
      "A square is equal on all two of its dimensions , a cube is equal on all of its 3 dimensions , and a hypercube is equal in all of its 4 dimensions",
      "* * TL;DR : A Hypercube is a cube in 4 dimensions , as opposed to a normal cube that only has 3 dimensions . What we see is the ' shadow ' of the hypercube pass trough our own dimension * * Let 's start by defining the dimensions . I assume you know what 3D is . 3D a geometrical concept where locations are measured in 3 numbers . { x , y , z } . You live in a 3d world . Everything you see is in 3D. Now , I also assume that you 're familiar with 2D. Things in 2D can be described with 2 numbers . { x , y } . A pixel on your screen for instance has an x and y position . The points on your high school graph / plot has x location and y location . 1D is the same concept . Just a line . You can mark a location on a line with 1 number , the length from one end of the line and to that location . But if there is 3D , and 2D , and 1D , there can also be 4D , and 5D , and 6D. There can be an infinte - D if you care to count . The rules of all those dimensions are the same . For a dimension N you must use N numbers to describe a location in it . so , the fourth dimension has a 4 point system . { x , y , z , w}(I think it was W , do n't kill me for it ) . A hypercube is a cube , but in 4D. Imagine it like this : A 3D cube is a cube , but a 2D ' cube ' is just a rectangle . A 2D circle is a sphere in 3D. Each shape that has a definition also has a definition in other dimension , they just change a bit to reflect and add the new dimension . A hypercube is the 4D version of the cube , the rectangle . . Now , we can not see the fourth dimension , can we ? We ca n't even imagine it . but we can understand the third dimension . a 3d Plane to 4D is just what a 2D plane is to 3D. a person in two dimensions would n't see us at all , and would n't understand a third dimension like we do n't understand a fourth one . But if a cube is to pass trough a paper that flat lander would see the cube as it passes as lines , changing and altering . It 's a bit hard to explain . Imagine That you would have a wall , cut a thin strip in it to look trough , and watch someone walk past it . You can only see a small part of him at a time , only what is currently passing the strip . you 'd first see a bit of the nose , then that bit would go away and the first bit of face appears , then that goes away and you see the eye and torso e.t.c . what is happening here is a cube passing trough our dimension , or the 2D shadow of it . The 3D ' shapes ' are just bits of the cube that are currently passing trough our slit that we can see . somewhere in the 4th dimension the rest of the cube is connected to what we see , but we just ca n't see it . as it passes and new areas of the cube passes by us the 3D shape on the screen morphs and changes to reflect how the 3D component of the 4D cube currently looks like from our perspective . . I may have gotten a bit off track , but that 's basically it . It 's a mathematical representation of what a 4D cube would look like if we would slide it trough our own dimension .",
      "First , let 's go through a mental exercise . We start with a point . It has neither length , nor width , nor height , nor volume . It has NO dimension . It is it 's own single termination point . Extend a point along one dimension . You have a line . It has length . It has two terminating points . Extend a line along another dimension . You get a plane with length and width , with four terminating points . Extend a plane along another dimension . You get a cube with length , width , height , and eight terminating points . Extend a cube along another dimension . You get , conceptually , a hyper cube . It has length , width , height , and some name for the fourth physical dimension I do n't know . It has 16 terminating points . You can do this unto infinity . That does n't mean our brains can mentally conceive what such shapes actually look like . What you 're looking at in these gifs are projections . Your hand is 3D , not 2D. But what does your hand look like if it were 2D ? You already know : look at your shadow . Another way to understand it is to pass your hand through a 2D plane , the cross section of your hand on that plane is going to start with a point , and bulge and change as your fingers , wrist , and forearm pass through it . And that is more precisely what you see here . These are cross sections of 4D objects passing through a 3D volume , exactly like the cross sections of a 3D volume passing through a 2D plane ."

When we look at the hypercube from different angles, it can appear to change shape or move in strange ways.

Wooden bridges , docks , boats are traditionally built with varieties of cypress , cedar , mahogany , teak and other rot - resistant types of lumber . Most trees have open - cell pores that allow water to wick through the wood . Some trees have closed - cell pores , and they \u00e2\u0080\u0099re more weather - resistant .

If you \u00e2\u0080\u0099re at a lumber yard and you want to tell which is which -- even lumber yards mix them up -- you look closely at the pores in the end grain . In the heartwood of white oak , those pores are plugged up with growths called tyloses . If you took a short dowel made from red oak , with its open pores , you could actually force air through it like a straw . But not white oak ! That \u00e2\u0080\u0099s why wine and whiskey barrels are usually made from white oak .

      "In the United States, the Affordable Care Act (also known as \"Obamacare\") requires most people to have health insurance. The goal of this law is to make sure that everyone has access to affordable health care, even if they have a pre-existing medical condition or are unable to pay for it on their own. \nIf you can't afford health insurance, you may be able to get help paying for it through a program called Medicaid. Medicaid is a government program that provides health insurance to low-income individuals and families. \nIf you don't have health insurance and don't qualify for Medicaid, you may have to pay a fine called the \"individual mandate penalty.\" This penalty is a way to encourage people to get health insurance, so that they can get the medical care they need and help spread the cost of that care across a larger group of people. \nIt's important to have health insurance because unexpected medical expenses can be very expensive. Having insurance helps protect you financially in case you need to see a doctor or go to the hospital. It can also make it easier to get the medical care you need, because you won't have to worry about how you will pay for it.",

    "question": "How to people die in \" stampedes \" ( Like Black Friday or the New Year 's stampede of people in Shanghai ) ? What is the cause of death and how does it actually happen ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "The two most common causes of death are crushing and trampling . Crushing happens when someone is stuck up against an immovable object and the crowd surge from behind presses them so hard that they are crushed / suffocated . Trampling occurs when someone falls , no one sees / hears , and they are simply stepped on until they are injured enough to be killed . Sometimes , due to the pressure of the crowd , even if people are trying to pull the person up , they are forced over them lest they fall and be trampled as well . In both scenarios , the problem is the back pressure from the people near the rear who ca n't see the dangerous conditions that are occurring at the front of the stampede . They keep pressing forward , causing problems . This is a particular problem when there is a dangerous situation to the rear ( such as in a fire , trying to escape through narrow doors ) as everyone wants to haul ass out of there , but there is an obstruction up front .",
      "Most of these answers are wrong . Most people do n't die of injuries ; they die of suffocation . You breathe by expanding your ribcage in your chest . If it ca n't expand , you ca n't breathe . If you 're lying on the ground and a big mass is on top of you , there 's just too much pressure on your torso to expand your ribcage , so you stop breathing and suffocate .",
      "If one falls over in a large crowd for example when the doors open on blackfriday people will literally be stepped on to death or crushed against walls . When they get in the situation its already to late because people may not hear you screaming in the back and they will keep on forcing there way in ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "A stampede is a situation where a large group of people are rushing or running in a panicked way, often because they are trying to escape from something or get to somewhere quickly. In a stampede, people may be trampled or crushed by the weight of the crowd, which can lead to serious injuries or death. \nThe cause of death in a stampede is usually due to suffocation or trauma, which can occur when people are pushed or squeezed too hard in a confined space. For example, if a large group of people are trying to get through a narrow doorway or passageway, and there is not enough room for everyone to go through at the same time, the pressure of the crowd can become very intense. People may fall down or be pushed to the ground, and if they are unable to get up or move out of the way, they may be trampled by other people who are still trying to move forward. \nIt is important to stay calm and avoid panicking in a stampede situation. If you find yourself in a stampede, try to find a safe place to take cover, such as a wall or a doorway. If you are able, try to help others who may be in danger or who are in need of assistance. It is also important to follow the instructions of authorities and emergency responders, who are trained to handle stampede situations and can help to keep people safe.",

Google is based in the United States, but it also operates in many countries around the world, including in the EU. \nIn 2018, the EU said that Google had violated EU competition rules by using its market power to unfairly promote its own services over those of its competitors. As a result, the EU ordered Google to pay a fine of $5 billion and to change its business practices. \nIn addition to the fine and the changes to its business practices, the EU also said that Google should be broken up into separate companies in order to reduce its market power and level the playing field for its competitors. However, Google has appealed this decision and the case is still ongoing. \nTo summarize, the EU can demand that a company like Google be broken up into separate companies because it has the power to make rules and regulations that apply to companies operating within its member countries.

      "Dry firing a bow is dangerous because it involves releasing the bowstring without an arrow nocked (attached) to it. When you dry fire a bow, the bowstring slams into the end of the bow without the cushioning effect of the arrow. This can cause the bow to break or the string to snap. In addition, the energy from the bowstring can damage the bow's limb pockets, which hold the limbs in place. This can cause the limbs to become loose or even fall off, making the bow unsafe to use.

      "Quarantine is a feature in antivirus software that allows you to isolate a file or program that is suspected to be malicious, so that it cannot harm your computer or device. When you quarantine a file or program, the antivirus software will move it to a special area on your computer where it is isolated from the rest of your system. This helps to prevent the file or program from being able to execute or perform any harmful actions on your computer. \nQuarantine is useful when you are not sure if a file or program is safe or not. For example, if you download a file from the internet and your antivirus software detects that it might be malicious, it will automatically quarantine the file to prevent it from causing any harm. \nUsing quarantine can be a good way to protect your computer from malicious software, but it is not always the best solution. If you are sure that a file or program is malicious, it is usually better to remove it from your computer entirely, rather than just isolating it in quarantine. This is because malicious software can sometimes still pose a threat even when it is in quarantine, and it is best to remove it completely to ensure that it cannot cause any harm.",

Sports cars have smaller engines that turn faster . Faster engine turns , faster you go . They need torque as well but can get by on mostly horsepower . So revving out to 10k rpm they can go really fast . Also if your truck redlines that low it is probably a diesel . Diesels make almost instant power but die off in high rpm so revving them higher is a waiste . Ferrari is opposite it loves high rpms and makes a ton of power near redline .",

Balance - As you 'd imagine , a slight shimmy at 4k rpm is annoying , at 10k it 's catastrophic , so all rotating parts are balanced to even tighter tolerances . Longevity - I think to a degree the higher RPM you sacrifice power and performance for longevity . a NASCAR engine only has to make it 500 miles , your truck , hopefully 300,000 or more . I might also add other things like fuel pressure , oil pressure , etc all need to be higher at those RPMs . I have little actual experience , just read a bunch .",

Wide receivers who switch to cornerback may not have as much time to develop the specific skills needed to play cornerback effectively. \n3. It's easier to find players who fit the mold: NFL teams generally prefer to draft or sign players who already have the skills and physical attributes needed to play a particular position. It can be easier to find players who are naturally suited to play cornerback than it is to find wide receivers who can be trained to play cornerback. \n4.

      "Surveys are inevitably biased to some degree , but bias can be minimised using a number of strategies : Survey design - trying to get the wording and ordering of questions in such a way that respondents are not influenced to answer in certain ways . Size of sample - a large sample with more respondents could potentially minimise bias , because even if a couple of participants deliberately lie , their impact on the overall findings is minimal . Control groups - testing the same survey with different target groups or slightly different formats ( for example changes to the order and wording of questions ) to see what difference this makes . Careful reporting - the reporting of survey results need to explicitly acknowledge potential biases , the gaps in the sample and the limits of the methodology . The findings must not be treated as ' facts ' but as evidence that is limited by the nature of the research . For example , rather than report that \" our survey found that 15 % of people cheat on their wives \" , a good researcher will report that \" 15 % of survey respondents - mostly white males in their 40s - reported cheating on their wives \" .",

Random sampling: Survey researchers try to select a representative sample of people to participate in the survey. By randomly selecting participants, researchers aim to minimize the chance that certain groups are overrepresented or underrepresented in the sample. \n2. Anonymity: Surveys may be designed to be anonymous, which means that the researchers do not know who filled out the survey. This can help reduce bias because people may feel more comfortable being honest when they don't have to worry about being identified. \n3. Neutral wording: Survey questions should be worded in a neutral way, without implying a certain answer. For example, a question that asks \"Do you think it is wrong to drink and drive?\" might bias people towards saying \"yes\" because of the use of the word \"wrong.\" Instead, a better question might be \"Do you think it is safe to drink and drive?\" \n4. Pilot testing: Before a survey is given to a large group of people, it is often tested with a smaller group to see if there are any problems with the questions or how they are worded. This can help researchers identify and fix any potential biases in the survey. \nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

      "Having more lawyers on your team can potentially give you more resources and support in a legal case, but it does not necessarily mean that you will have more power in court. The outcome of a legal case is determined by the facts of the case and the application of the law to those facts, not by the number of lawyers involved. \nHaving a larger team of lawyers can be beneficial because it allows for more people to work on different aspects of the case, such as researching the law, gathering evidence, and preparing legal arguments. It can also allow for more flexibility if some lawyers need to focus on other cases or if unexpected developments arise. \nHowever, it's important to note that having a larger team of lawyers does not guarantee a favorable outcome in court. The number of lawyers involved in a case is just one factor among many that can affect the outcome.",

The burning of crosses is one of the symbols that the Klan has used to intimidate and terrorize people. \nThe reason that the Klan burns crosses specifically, rather than circles or triangles, is not because African Americans are religious. In fact, the Klan has often targeted African Americans regardless of their religious beliefs. \nThe origins of the cross burning can be traced back to the early days of the Klan, when the group was founded in the Reconstruction-era South after the Civil War. At that time, the Klan would hold secret meetings in which they would burn crosses as a way to signal to other members that a meeting was about to take place. Over time, the burning of crosses became associated with the Klan's hateful and violent ideology and was used as a way to intimidate and threaten people.",

    "human_answer": [
      "Timbre . An A on either is not a single frequency , it is a \" fundamental \" and a bunch of multiples of that frequency , called \" overtones \" . Together they make up the timbre of that instrument . Different instruments have different overtones . Of course , they may also have other characteristics , such as the rate of attack ( how the volume grows from zero to full amplitude ) and decay ( the opposite ) .",
      "Two main things differentiate different sounds that have the same frequency . One is the \" shape \" of the sound . In nature , the shape of the frequency is likely to be a sine - wave . On a graph it would be a snake - like shape . Electronically generated sounds can have different shapes , like a square - wave , sawtooth - wave , or whatever . Second is the overtones . Suppose the frequency is middle C , at 262 beats per second . One instrument might have a strong overtone at the next C up , with a frequency of 524 beats per second . Another instrument might have hardly any sound there , but a strong overtone at the next C above that . We hear the lowest frequency as the note , and we hear the shape and the overtone as information about the kind of instrument that created that note .",
      "Three main things : * Timbre ( Which overtones - I 'll explain what those are soon - are most present in the sound ) * Envelope . This describes the amplitude shape of the sound - how hard is the attack , how long does the attack stay that way , how long does the sound last , and how quickly does the sound decay ? In a synthesizer , you can control all of these components through something called ADSR ( Attack - Decay - Sustain - Release ) . * Additional Noise ( The sound of the guitar amp hum , the squeak of a piano pedal , the rosin of the bow on the violin string , etc ) Now , Timbre . Notes are made of vibrations . Imagine a vibrating string . That string vibrates along its entire length , but it also vibrates along divisions of that length . The smaller the divisions , the higher the notes . This means that inside of every note you hear are several , fainter , higher notes . These are called partials , overtones , or harmonics . An instrument 's timbre is decided largely by the * balance * of those overtones . A flute , for example , has a very pure overtone expression with mostly lower , consonant ( meaning , for ELI5 purposes , \" pleasant \" ) partials . This gives it a clear sound . A distorted electric guitar , by contrast , has a lot of presence in its higher partials , which gives it more of a jagged quality . This is an over - simplified version , but all you need to know is that the overtone pattern determines much of the quality of the sound . You can actually hear the overtone series in your own voice , because each vowel brings out a different overtone . Sing a medium - low note in your range , clearly , and switch slowly between \" ooh \" and \" ee \" - you should hear , faintly , a note above the note you 're singing that suddenly gets higher and louder when you sing the \" ee \" . If you get good enough at this , you can do what [ this weird awesome lady ] ( URL_0 ) does and sing two notes at the same time . The same thing that makes two of your vowels sound different - even though they 're almost identical sounds coming from the same voice - is what makes two instruments sound different : overtones . But what happens if two instruments have similar overtone profiles ? A trumpet and an oboe , for example , have almost identical timbres . Here we want to look at our envelope , particularly our attack . A trumpet has a very crisp , biting attack that 's very fast , while an oboe has a much more mellow attack . If we jump into the middle of an oboe or trumpet note , it 's hard to hear the difference - but that initial attack & sputter in the trumpet makes the difference very clear ! The vocal equivalent of this would be consonants . Finally , noise . In addition to the overtone series and the envelope , there are all sorts of noises that go along with a sound that we may not consider as musical but are nonetheless important . The sound of additional air coming through a trumpet , the rattle in somebody 's voice when they sing a note too early in the morning , the buzz of a guitar amplifier . Our ear takes all of these clues , puts them together , and - voila ! - you 've perceived not just what the note is , but what kind of instrument is making the note !"
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "Sure! When we listen to music, we can hear different sounds made by different instruments. Each instrument makes a sound that is unique to that instrument, and we can tell them apart based on the way they sound. \nFor example, when you play an \"A\" note on a cello, it will sound different from when you play an \"A\" note on a piano. This is because the cello and the piano are different instruments, and they produce sound in different ways. \nThe cello uses strings that are played with a bow, and the strings vibrate to create sound. The piano uses strings that are struck by hammers when you press a key, and the strings vibrate to create sound. Because the cello and the piano use different methods to produce sound, the \"A\" notes they play will sound different. \nThe pitch of a note refers to how high or low it sounds. An \"A\" note on a cello and an \"A\" note on a piano will have the same pitch, but they will sound different because of the way the instruments produce sound. \nI hope that helps!

      "> ELI5 : Why is the human sense of smell so bad ? Because our ancestors did n't need it to maximize their evolutionary fitness ( i.e. being able to produce a maximal number of surviving grand - children ) . > Are there other carnivores who ca n't smell ? Good question , sadly I 'm not a zoologist . Humans , however , are considered omnivores . Like pigs . And they smell really bad ~~(pun intended)~~. But their ability to smell is good . See comment below . EDIT : Think of predatory birds .",
      "Basically , our distant ancestors were able to survive and have children , despite lacking super - smell powers . Their children were able to reproduce as well . Our smell is good enough that we can tell when food is spoiled rotten , and when to leave a dangerous area . Humans whose senses of smell could n't even do that , eventually died off from poisoning . There could be some humans with supremely good olfactory senses , and their children may inherit them too . But there is still no reason for those of us with lower smell to be unable to reproduce .",
      "Most of the birds . We , like birds , evolved to have good eyesight . We are also not carnivores , we are omnivores ."

      "The human sense of smell is not necessarily \"bad\" compared to other animals, but it is not as finely tuned as the sense of smell of some other species. This is because the part of the human brain responsible for processing smells (the olfactory bulb) is not as well developed as in animals that rely more heavily on their sense of smell to find food, avoid predators, and communicate with each other. \nThere are many other carnivores (meat-eating animals) that have a much stronger sense of smell than humans. For example, dogs and bears have a highly developed sense of smell that they use to locate food, detect the presence of other animals, and communicate with each other. Some animals, such as snakes, use their sense of smell to locate prey, while others, such as lions and tigers, use it to hunt and locate other animals. \nSo, while the human sense of smell may not be as strong as some other animals, it still serves important functions, such as helping us detect and avoid rotten or spoiled food, and helping us recognize and differentiate between different odors.",

    "question": "How do they shoot space movies to look like zero gravity ? I 'm talking older movies , too , like 2001 a Space Odyssey when superior editing technology was still a ways off . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "In the case of 2001 it was actually really clever : They suspended the actors on wires just like a lot of movies used to do , but they built the set sideways and put the camera on the ground pointing upwards . This accomplished two things : First , the actor 's body hid the wires so you did n't have to try to remove them in post . Second , the actor 's movements drifting horizontally ( which , from the camera 's perspective , appeared to be vertical ) looked WAY more natural than having a stagehand jerk the wires up and down .",
      "You have a few options . You can either use wires and camera tricks to make the actor appear weightless , or you can rent a large plane and fly in series of parabolic arcs to simulate weightlessness for short intervals .",

    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "There are several techniques that filmmakers use to create the illusion of zero gravity in movies. One technique is called \"forced perspective.\" This involves shooting a scene with the camera at an angle that makes objects in the foreground look larger than they are, while objects in the background appear smaller. This creates the illusion that the objects in the foreground are closer to the camera and are therefore subject to less gravity. \nAnother technique is called \"high-speed photography.\" This involves shooting a scene at a very high frame rate, typically hundreds or thousands of frames per second. When the footage is played back at a normal frame rate, it appears as though the objects in the scene are moving much more slowly than they actually are. This can be used to make it look like objects are floating or moving slowly in a weightless environment. \nIn some cases, filmmakers will also use special effects and computer-generated imagery (CGI) to create the illusion of zero gravity. This can involve digitally altering the movement of objects in a scene or creating entirely digital environments that look like they are in space. \nIn the past, filmmakers have also used practical effects to create the illusion of zero gravity. For example, in the movie \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" the filmmakers used a special rig called a \"zero gravity plane\" to simulate weightlessness. The plane would fly in a parabolic pattern, allowing the actors to experience brief periods of weightlessness. The filmmakers then shot the scenes during these periods and used editing techniques to make it look like the actors were in a weightless environment.",

    "generated_answer": [
      "Sports arenas in the US are often funded by taxpayers, but that does not mean that people do not have to pay to watch games or events in those arenas or on TV. The cost of building and maintaining sports arenas is typically paid for through a combination of public funds and private investment. While taxpayers may contribute to the construction and upkeep of the arenas, they are still operated as businesses, and the teams and organizations that use the arenas generate revenue by charging people to attend games or events and through television contracts. \nThe NFL (National Football League) is a professional sports league in the US that consists of 32 teams. The NFL generates revenue through various sources, including ticket sales, merchandise sales, and television contracts. The NFL Network is a television network that is owned and operated by the NFL, and it broadcasts live NFL games and other programming related to the league. The NFL Network is able to exist because it is able to generate revenue through subscriptions and advertising. \nWhile it might seem unfair that people have to pay to watch sports games or events on TV or in person, it is important to remember that professional sports teams and leagues are businesses that need to generate revenue to cover their expenses, including player salaries, arena maintenance and operations, and other costs. Without this revenue, it would not be possible for these organizations to continue operating.",

    "question": "Why is the AK-47 such a popular weapon and why is it not used by british and US armed forces ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "It takes 15 minutes to learn a person who have never seen a gun before to use and maintain a AK47 . For an M16 rifle you need the better part of a week . The AK47 is altso cheap and easy to make so in very little time and for very little money ( relative ) you could ship ten thousands of AK47 to a conflict area . Its altso solid enough to use as a shovel , it does not mind beeing wet inside , sand and dirt makes it laough , its ammo will punch through brick walls and threes , you can run over it with a truck and it will just blow its nose and you can take a boltcarrier from an russian AK made in the 50 's , a romanian reciever from the 80 's and a chinese magazine made today and put together a frankenstein gun that will work flawlessly ... None of these things can be said of the standard M16",
      "It 's the world 's most popular assault rifle , a weapon all fighters love . An elegantly simple nine pound amalgamation of forged steel and plywood , it does n't break , jam , or overheat . It will shoot whether it 's covered in mud or filled with sand . It 's so easy even a child can use it , and they do . The Soviets put the gun on a coin , Mozambique put it on their flag . Since the end of the Cold War , the Kalashnikov has become the Russian people 's greatest export . After that comes vodka , caviar , and suicidal novelists .",
      "AK47s robustness and reliability has nothing to do with its popularity . The reasons for popularity are two : First reason is that an AK47 is extremely easy to manufacture from basic materials and following in the best Soviet tradition you do not need high tolerances to make it work so the parts do n't need to be perfect . The only automatic guns which were simpler than an AK were British Sten and American Grease Gun from WW2 . Unlike both of them AK is a better and more reliable and is an actual assault rifle capable of shooting rifle ammunition - proper 7.62 mm bullets . This meant it was the perfect weapon for developing countries without a huge industrial base - most of the third world . You did n't need huge factories and skilled workforce . The second reason was political . AK was licensed for close to nothing by the USSR to every country which wanted to get on anti - imperialist bandwagon . It was also exported in huge amounts directly from the USSR . You wanted to overthrow imperialists ! Here you go . That 's how China got their AK clones . That 's how Vietcong and other insurgent movements in South East Asia got theirs . That 's how half of Africa got theirs . It was also the standard weapon of the Warsaw Pact armies . [ Here ] ( URL_1 ) is a list of countries which produced their variants of AK47 either on license or without it . When those countries wanted to earn some money they were selling AK47s to governments , new regimes , insurgent forces , revolutionaries ... And because there were so many copies , variants and knock - offs it was near impossible to track down which formal variant or license was used to manufacture which rifle . Combine that with the general approach to licenses in the Soviet Union ( capitalist nonsense ! ) and you essentially get an * * Open Source Assault Rifle * * . Anyone anywhere with access to basic metalworking tools could build an AK47 . That would not be possible with Western mode of arms production which was proprietary and made for profit and if someone started knocking off an M16 or FN Fal there would be court cases and other similar stuff . So if you needed cheap gun that you can manufacture at home when the need arises AK47 was your pick ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- As for the reasons why it was n't adopted by Western armies there are again two reasons which mirror the causes of Ak47 's huge * non*commercial success First was that AKs robustness , simplicity and reliability came at the expense of accuracy and weight . AK47s were barely accurate beyond 100 - 200 m and they were heavy and heavier still if made from poor quality materials . They were also relatively uncomfortable to use . An AK is a bit clunky in handling which is why they were constantly improved . Ak74 which was the 5.45 mm variant was one such improvement . The Israelis had modified the AK to produce their standard rifle IAI Galil . The main advantage of AKs were numbers and low cost . Many countries went the opposite route and manufactured more sophisticated and accurate weapons that tried to improve on the design . While Americans worked through more classic M16 to M4 the Brits , French and some other countries tried [ bullpup ] ( URL_0 ) configuration in their SA80 , AUG , FAMAS etc . Second reason was political naturally . Apart from the awkwardness of using an enemy design in the West selling arms was a huge and profitable * business * . Defense spending is as much about providing tools for defense as it is about jobs for voters and kick - offs to donors . Large European countries had arms manufacturers which wanted to do something more than produce guns on American license because a ) it is less profitable with license fees b ) less prospective for future operations . So the ability to produce guns at home coupled with protectionist approach to most \" defense industries \" meant that every country with its own factory capable of building decent guns was making their own model . And sometimes that meant a highly modified AK ! Just for the sake of selling an unique product on their own rules . Small countries were buying guns produced by larger manufacturers in government - sponsored deals where half of the negotiations to buy say FN guns or M16s would be not between the ministry of defense and the manufacturer but between the politicians of both countries negotiating who is going to take what bribe ."

It was designed to be used by people with little training, and it can continue to work even if it is not well-maintained. It is also very durable, so it can withstand rough treatment in harsh environments. \nThe AK-47 is not used by the British and US armed forces because they have their own weapons that they prefer to use. These weapons are often more advanced and better suited to the specific needs of their armed forces. They may also be more expensive or require more maintenance than the AK-47. Additionally, the UK and US may have different political or economic relationships with the countries that produce the AK-47, which could affect their decision to use it.",

    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "In the United States, street numbers are usually assigned based on the distance of the building or lot from the beginning of the street or block. For example, if a street starts at 0 or 1, the first building on the left side of the street might be numbered 2, and the second building might be numbered 4, and so on. The numbering continues on each side of the street, so the first building on the right side of the street might be numbered 1, and the second building might be numbered 3, and so on. \nThis system can result in seemingly random or irregular numbering, especially on long streets or blocks. For example, if a street runs for several miles, the numbers may increase by 100 or more for each block. This means that you might see a building with the number 22097 next to a building with the number 22092. \nIn some cases, the street numbers may also be affected by historical factors or changes in the layout of the street or neighborhood. For example, if a street was originally laid out in a different pattern or if buildings were added or removed over time, it can result in seemingly random or irregular numbering. \nOverall, the system of street numbering in the United States is designed to help people find specific addresses and locations easily and efficiently. Even though the numbers may seem random at first, they usually follow a logical pattern based on the location of the building or lot on the street or block.",

    "generated_answer": [
      "The Confederate States of America, which was formed in 1861 by a group of Southern states that had seceded from the United States, was able to fund its military efforts and create units quickly because it had access to a number of resources. \nOne resource was money. The Confederate government was able to generate money by issuing bonds, which were essentially loans that people or organizations could buy. The government promised to pay back the bonds with interest at a later date. The Confederate government also printed its own currency, called Confederate States of America dollars, which it used to pay for goods and services. \nAnother resource was people. The Confederate army was made up of volunteers who signed up to fight for the cause. Many of these volunteers were farmers, shopkeepers, and other civilians who were not professional soldiers. The Confederate government was also able to create units quickly because it had access to military bases, weapons, and other supplies that had been left behind by the United States government when the Southern states seceded. \nFinally, it's worth noting that the Confederacy did have some prior preparation for military conflict. Some Southern states had been building up their militias (local military units) and stockpiling weapons in anticipation of a possible conflict with the North. Additionally, many Southerners owned guns and were familiar with how to use them, which made it easier to form an army.",

      "There 's a concept called the \" Hayflick limit \" , which basically says , a cell can only divide so many times before it loses the ability to . They believe it occurs on the DNA level , a piece is lost each replication , and when enough has been lost , the cell ca n't reproduce again . All living creatures are constantly breaking down , and repairing themselves with new cells . When they ca n't fix the broken parts , they begin to fail , and death is on the way . The rate the break down / repair happens , and the amount of times a cell can be replaced , varies by animal , resulting in drastically different lifespans . It 's worth mentioning , that in nature , animals ( including humans ) rarely live to this point . Predators , accidents , sickness , and excessive wear and tear ( teeth worn to the point they ca n't eat , for instance ) are generally what causes death .

In these cases having the mature adult compete with the offspring for food is disadvantageous . Other species require care until the young can fend for themselves . In these cases , the additional resources needed to sustain the parent for a longer period of time is outweighed by the protection / training they can afford the next generation . Species that can remain sexually active through longer periods of their life will also have less invested in each individual reproduction cycle , so evolution might select for trading caring for their young for multiple reproductive cycles throughout their lifespan .

      "Sneezing is a reflex that helps to protect your body by clearing your nose of irritants, such as dust, pollen, or other substances that can cause an allergic reaction. When your nose is exposed to an irritant, it sends a signal to your brain, which then triggers the muscles in your nose, throat, and chest to contract, causing you to sneeze. \nLooking at a bright light can sometimes trigger the reflex to sneeze because the light can stimulate certain nerve fibers in your eye that are connected to the muscles in your nose and throat. These nerve fibers are called the trigeminal nerve, and they help to control the reflexes that cause you to sneeze, as well as other reflexes, such as blinking and coughing. \nSo, when you look at a bright light, it can stimulate these nerve fibers, causing the muscles in your nose and throat to contract and resulting in a sneeze.

During this process, your eyes become more sensitive to low levels of light, which makes it easier to see in the dark. \nYour eyes have two types of cells called rods and cones that help you see. Rods are more sensitive to low levels of light and are responsible for your night vision. Cones are more sensitive to bright light and are responsible for your color vision. When you're in a dark room, your rods are more active and your cones are less active, which is why it can be harder to see colors in the dark. \nSo when you're in a dark room, it can be easier to see objects if you don't look directly at them because your rods are more sensitive to low levels of light, and looking directly at something can cause your cones to become more active, which can make it harder to see.",

    "generated_answer": [
      "Airlines typically don't lower the price of flights close to the departure time because they want to maximize their profits. If an airline has a flight that isn't fully booked, they may try to sell the remaining seats for a lower price to try to fill the plane, but they usually don't want to lower the price too much because they want to make as much money as possible from the flights they operate. \nThink of it this way: if an airline has a flight that costs $1000 per seat and they sell all the seats, they will make a profit of $1000 per seat x the number of seats on the plane. However, if they only sell half the seats and then lower the price to try to fill the remaining seats, they will make less money overall, even if they are able to sell the remaining seats for a lower price. \nIn some cases, airlines may offer last-minute discounts or promotions to try to fill flights that aren't fully booked, but they generally don't want to do this too often because it can devalue the overall price of their flights and make it more difficult for them to sell tickets at full price in the future.",

      "Hoo boy , this is a big one . I 'll try my best to be brief and give only the minimum necessary details . If you want more clarification , you can reply with questions . Here we go : * Motherboard : the \" body \" of the computer , it connects all the other parts together , and allows connections with peripherals . It 's a big circuit board , and has plugs on it 's surface for components , and plugs on the edge for USBs , monitor , keyboard / mouse , speakers , etc . * PSU(Power Supply Unit ): provides power to all the other parts . It 's the thing you plug your power cord into , and it has wires hanging off of it that you attach to the other parts . * CPU(Central Processing Unit ): the \" brain \" of the computer . It performs calculations and makes everything work . The speed that the processor works at is measured in GHz(Gigahertz , or billions of cycles per second ) . * GPU(Graphics Processing Unit ): a secondary processor that specializes in performing vector math really really fast , to allow for 3d graphics to be presented on screen . * RAM(Random Access Memory ): the short - term memory of your computer . It holds on to data that the processor might need really soon , and data can be written to it and read from it almost instantly , but it ca n't hold much at once , and it needs power to keep that data : as soon as you turn off the power , memory is wiped . Measured in GB ( ~billions of bytes ) * Hard Drive : the long - term memory of the computer . There 's a physical spinning disc inside that can hold lots and lots of data and the data is persistent(isn't lost when power is gone ) , but it takes a really long time to read and write . Measured in GB or TB , for particularly large ones . * Optical Drive : reads CDs , removable storage , starting to go out of fashion in favor of flash drives , I did n't bother to buy one for my desktop , have n't needed one in five years . edit : added bit about read / write times .",
      "Mainboard : Circuit board that lets all your PC components communicate via buses and does some low level computation . Also collects all inputs and deliver all outputs . CPU/\"Processor \" : Main computing unit . Does all the heavy lifting by getting fed input , memory from your drives and computing outputs . Has small storage named \" cache \" that is very fast and is basically equivalent to you counting your fingers while adding 2 + 3 . GPU/\"Video Card \" : The card is technically just another circuit board on which the GPU is located . This is just a specialized processor that is very good at calculating many simple things at the same time ( like the colors of the pixels on your screen ) . It gets information what to display from your CPU , generates images and feeds them to your screen . GHz : Number of clock changes . VERY BASICALLY any processor does this : read data - compute - write new data . Each of these steps take up a few clocks . So the more clocks happen in a second , the more computations take place and the faster the processor works . This is influenced by multicore and general core design so a 3GHz processor from today is multiple times faster than a 3GHz processor from 8 years ago . RAM/\"Memory \" : The memory banks on your Mainboard . These are 100x faster than your Hard Drives and still MUCH slower than the CPU cache . Basically a middle ground . Think writing the numbers on a sheet of paper while dividing 1199/32 and counting the carry on your fingers ( cache ) . A basic operation example looks like this : From when you booted your PC , there is already a table on how letters are supposed to look stored in your RAM . If you press a letter on your keyboard now , the input code ( for example \" 82 \" in binary ) is transmitted by your Mainboard to your CPU . The CPU now utilizes its cache and executes various \" op codes \" that basically tell it to take the letter code , grab the relevant info from the RAM , write it back into the memory of the program you are using and at the same time tell your GPU that it shall update the current screen with the new letter \" R \" at a certain position .",
      "processor : does the processing ( calculation ) , made up of millions of transistor ( an electronic switch just like any switch to make or break connection but very tiny and fast ) . Famous manufacturing company : Intel , AMD etc GHz(10 ^ 9 hz or cycles per second ) : clock speed , clock is basically a square wave and it turns out your processor 's job is to execute instructions ( programs = set of instruction ) and it takes some cycles of this square wave for each instruction to get executed , more GHz means more clock speed means if your instruction take 4 clock cycles to execute then increasing clock speed would decrease the time it take to execute that instruction because in same 1 second time more no of cycles are being passed to processor . so if we talk about dual core then 2.2 Ghz is faster than 1.8 Ghz video / graphics card : your processor is enough busy running numerous task ( front and background applications ) so it is better to have a seperate processor for graphics heavy applications unless you want your screen to freeze time to time . So it is a graphics processor with its own clock speed to work on like 820 Mhz etc , it also has its own RAM that s why 2 gb ram graphic card . RAM : volatile memory , data remains as long as power in it after that it vanish Hard disk : computer storehouse : u dump ur games , video , porn ? here BUSES : wires that connect all these stuff and let data flow between them Motherboard : put all these components onto this board power supply : supply power working : switch on pc- > current runs everywhere inside- > bootloader loads some set of instruction permanently stored in ROM onto processor - > it then loads OS - > several processes comes alive and you have ur desktop screen in front of you - > u click batman arkham origin - > data from harddisk runs to ram and then to processor - > processor identifies it needs graphics card too - > data flows to graphic card , it processes and send that to ram from there to your screen all this transfer is through PCIe lanes ( very fast lanes like freeways or highways ) - > you click and respond and kick some ass"

Far too many programs modify the registry and therefore require a reboot . Ideally it 'd be just drivers and not always those .",
      "Some people try to make this into a Windows vs * nix debate , but in all honesty even * nix systems require restarts for certain type of updates . Simply put , it 's related to how computers work and how modern OSes ( Windows , * nix variants work fundamentally the same way in this regard ) execute programs . They load the program into memory when it starts , and it does n't reload it after it is running ( and is really hard to do safely ) . This means that when updates change the programs , the running programs do not know about the changes and keep on going . There are exceptions and it all has to do with how the program was written to execute . Stuff like images or fonts can be re - read while the program is running so they can apply changes on the fly . Other stuff that change the logic in the program itself can not be as easily reloaded . Generally speaking I will restart machines that are running critical apps after updates , regardless of what OS they are running ( Windows or Linux variants ) . Why ? Because it 's the safest route to ensure everything is running up to date versions . Take Linux for example . A lot of times a program will used a shared object or have a persistent service running using a particular command . If these components are updated and the related processes / services are not restarted , they will not have the changes applied . If these are critical security fixes , then there 's a high chance that a vulnerable version is running even if you 've patched it . Windows tends to err on the side of caution on this regard ."

      "No , but not because our typing behavior has changed . It would be because our devices have changed .

The QWERTY layout comes from the layout of old typewriters and was meticulously designed in such a way to minimize the chance of two commonly consecutive letters being close to each other .

Nowadays of course we do n't have to worry about the computer jamming when we press two letters too quickly - but the people were already used to the QWERTY layout and so it became the standard for modern computer keyboards even though there are many different layouts like the [ dvorak or colemak layouts ] ( URL_0 ) that a small number of people will swear by because they are supposedly much faster .",

However, there have been other keyboard layouts developed over the years that aim to improve typing speed and efficiency. One example is the Dvorak layout, which was designed in the 1930s and is believed by some to be easier to type on than the QWERTY layout. \nAs for whether our behavior in typing and the use of words has changed enough to warrant a change in the keyboard layout, it is difficult to say.

Leaving those roads was forbidden , and you needed a visa to get in or out . There was also a few railroads with interzonal trains , which would go straight through Eastern Germany , though never stopped ( except for border controls ) . At one point , those were blocked due to an economic dispute . This led to a massive airlift operation , delivering 4700 tons of supplies per day , with almost 200 000 flights per day . Total cost of the operation is estimated to be between 2 to 5 billion , and 25 planes crashed .",
      "Adding to what others stated , there would be rail trains or convoys that were allowed to pass , from West Germany , through East Germany to West Berlin . But these routes could , and were , shut down whenever a political spat occurred between East and West . Also , it was very dangerous to divert from that road as the Stasi & soldiers patrolled that area and would use deadly force if they thought you were a spy . As for the air routes , there were three routes to three airports in West Berlin ( Tegel , which will be shut down when the new airport is built , Berlin Templehof , Nazi era airport and recently shut down and turned into historical site , and Gatow , a British RAF airbase that is now suburbs and a Luftwaffe museum ) that had strict routes where diversion from them meant a shootdown by the East German air force .

In other words people were free to cross from east to west Berlin to meet friends , buy goods and services , and so on . Once the Berlin Wall was built everything changed . In fact one of the main purposes of the Berlin Wall 's creation was to basically besiege west Berlin by preventing supplies getting in . That problem was overcome by the western powers launching a non - stop 24 - hour - a - day airdrop of supplies to west Berliners , continuing for weeks . Once the East German government relented a little and allowed supplies into west Berlin , it then functioned just as any other small and relatively isolated city did ."

      "During the Cold War, the city of Berlin was located deep within the territory of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), also known as East Germany. The city was divided into two parts: West Berlin, which was controlled by the Western powers (the United States, the United Kingdom, and France), and East Berlin, which was controlled by the Soviet Union. \nWest Berlin was located on the western side of the Berlin Wall, which was a heavily fortified barrier that separated the two parts of the city. The wall was built in 1961 to prevent people from East Germany from fleeing to the West. It was guarded by East German soldiers, and anyone who tried to cross the wall illegally could be shot. \nDespite being surrounded by East Germany, West Berlin was not controlled by the GDR or the Soviet Union. Instead, it was a free and democratic city, similar to other cities in Western Europe. The Western powers provided the city with food, fuel, and other supplies to help it survive. They also allowed people from West Berlin to travel freely to other parts of Western Europe. \nEast Berlin, on the other hand, was a communist city and was controlled by the GDR and the Soviet Union. It was not as open or free as West Berlin, and people who lived there had fewer freedoms and rights. \nThe situation in Berlin remained like this until the end of the Cold War in the 1990s, when the Berlin Wall was finally taken down and the city was reunited.",

    "question": "Can artificial intelligence ever be conscious or self - aware ? How ? It seems to me that since every computer will be made out of pre - fed algorithms , machines can never achieve consciousness like us Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Software developer here , > It seems to me that since every computer will be made out of pre - fed algorithms That 's not accurate . I would n't necessarily call it wrong , but too simplistic . There are algorithms called \" genetic algorithms . \" The key of these algorithms is that a data stream that is exactly analogous to DNA dictates the behavior of the system , while the algorithm is static and controls mutation , breeding , and fitness . These equations can be used for just about anything . You can literally breed more fuel efficient engines , more aerodynamic cars and planes , you can teach robots to do their job , virtual creatures to walk , or survive in their virtual environments ; these algorithms do make their way into physical robots in industrial production and research labs . The DNA data can be arbitrarily long and represent arbitrarily complicated behavior . To some degree , complexity can be so high that humans basically ca n't explain how it 's working . One famous demonstration used genetic algorithms to configure a programmable processor to recognize human voice . After 40k generations , in software , over the course of a couple weeks , the hardware device was able to identify a human voice perfectly , and the scientists had absolutely no clue how it worked . Parts of the circuit were wired in weird ways and did n't connect to anything . When they removed that part of the circuit , the device stopped working . They could only reason that the algorithm implicitly took advantage of some electrical resonance or bleeding across circuits of that exact , particular , specific processor ( there are always manufacture flaws and variations between chips in a batch ) . There are software and now some fantastic hardware that represents neurons of the brain . These virtual neurons can be wired into a network , usually virtually . They 're allowed to rewire themselves with static algorithms that determine when a change is necessary , and each neuron can \" learn \" ; they use little equations to determine if they 're supposed to signal their outputs depending on their inputs , and this builds neural path ways . These algorithms are used in cochlear ( hearing ) implants , they 're used in stock market trading , they 're used in robots and vision systems , they 're popular in \" learning AI \" . Robots and virtual creatures can learn to walk and navigate a maze . They can simulate learning and memory . You 're basically making a little brain . In fact , Google finished a research project a few months ago where they simulated a small brain . The neural net was configured to model the physical structures of real animal brains , since we have a good understanding these days of that . The brain was allowed to consume information from a selection of internet data and guess what ? It really likes cats . No , I 'm not kidding . --- There are plenty more examples and different technologies . The basic algorithm may be static but it may also give rise to astounding complexity . Evolution itself is principally simple and our DNA sequences , when decoded , fill DVDs . We are not driven by simple algorithms of nature , but the astounding complexity ( data , DNA ) that comes from it . Computers are already doing this on a much smaller scale , but there 's no reason a computer ca n't achieve similar complexity . --- Briefly , you have to argue what you consider consciousness and self awareness even is . Does a single sell organism have consciousness ? I say a Furby has consciousness . For example , it is self aware when it is upside down , and it does n't like that . At a very low , primitive level , like that of a single celled organism , it is conscious .",
      "Well even my heating is self aware ( It switches off when it notices it is a certain temperature ) . What is to say that we are n't just very , very complicated pre - fed algorithms ? Does that mean we are n't concious ? Personally I think we will see artificial intelligence in our lifetimes , with breakthroughs made in shirking down components and advancements in machine learning it is only a matter of time before the two combine . Known as the singularity . If you want to see sometimes to make you excited watch these ; URL_2 URL_1 URL_0",
      "We do nt fully know how it would happen but the logic is pretty simple as to why it could . If you could get a computer to perfectly simulate a human brain cell , and then extend that to perfectly simulate every brain cell in a humans brain then boom it might have consciousness . Our brain cells follow very simple rules that are very programmable . Out of those simple rules comes our complex consciousness . No reason to think a computer could nt do the same . Obviously though there is a chance there is something more complicated than that to consciousness but I would argue if it happens in the real world we can probably make a simulation of it given a powerful enough computer . There also may be other ways for a computer to achieve consciousness outside of simulating brain cells . We just do nt know very well how self awareness even works ."

      "Consciousness and self-awareness are complex phenomena that are not fully understood by scientists and philosophers. Some people believe that it is possible for artificial intelligence to be conscious or self-aware, while others believe that these capabilities are uniquely human and cannot be replicated in a machine. \nOne way that artificial intelligence could potentially achieve consciousness or self-awareness is if it were able to develop its own thoughts and feelings, rather than simply following pre-programmed instructions. This could involve creating artificial neural networks that mimic the structure and function of the human brain, and giving the AI access to sensory inputs that it can use to learn and adapt. \nHowever, it is also important to note that even if an artificial intelligence were able to develop consciousness or self-awareness, it is not clear whether it would be the same as human consciousness or self-awareness. There are many different theories about what consciousness and self-awareness are, and it is possible that artificial intelligence could have a fundamentally different experience of these phenomena. \nIn summary, it is currently not clear whether artificial intelligence can ever be conscious or self-aware, and more research is needed to better understand these complex issues.",

      "Applying to college can be a costly process, and one of the expenses you may encounter is application fees. These fees are usually charged by the colleges or universities that you are applying to and are used to cover the costs of reviewing and processing your application. This includes things like paying staff to review your transcripts, test scores, and other application materials, as well as maintaining the online application system and other administrative expenses. \nIt's important to understand that colleges and universities are not-for-profit institutions, which means that they do not operate for the purpose of making money. Instead, they rely on tuition, donations, and other sources of funding to cover their expenses, including the cost of reviewing and processing applications. \nWhile it may seem unfair to have to pay to apply to college, it's important to remember that the education you receive at a college or university is a valuable investment in your future. The application process is just one part of that investment, and the fees you pay help to ensure that you have access to a high-quality education that will prepare you for success in your career.",

    "question": "What would happen if all U.S. troops were pulled out of the Middle East ? I always see / hear controversy over if troops should be deployed somewhere or removed . I am just wondering would would actually happen if all troops were removed . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "If all troops were removed you would see power vacuums pop up pretty quickly . The US having troops in the region gives us influence not only in the countries we have troops but also in surrounding countries . Additionally a lot of what the US is doing now is training the militaries on Tactics and procedures so that they are more effective on their own . If the US were to remove all of it 's troops we would have no influence in the region . We would be unable to negotiate from a place of power with countries like Iran and Syria . There would also be a power vacuum left . Countries like Iraq and Afghanistan , as well as others that we have quieter relations with , would struggle to develop their militaries into an effective fighting force against the terrorist groups like ISIS operating in the area . I would estimate that within 12 months the Iraqi government would fail leading to a breeding ground for terrorists . Within 24 months the Afghani government would fail . I say this because Iraq is under a larger more immediate threat , where the Afghani government is in a more drawn out fight that is going to need US guidance over the coming years to develop their military properly . Essentially the entire region , even places that are relatively stable today like Jordan , could become failed states without a strong outside influence giving guidance on how to fight the Guerilla warfare tactics of these terrorist organizations . Now one might argue we 're clearly not good at fighting these groups if we 're still there . But the fact is we 've improved dramatically since 2001 when it comes to fighting these battles . But we 've learned our lessons and we 've adapted .",

      "If all U.S. troops were to be pulled out of the Middle East, it would depend on the specific country or region in question. In general, it's likely that there would be a power vacuum left behind, as the U.S. military has played a significant role in maintaining stability and providing security in the region. Without the U.S. military presence, other countries or groups may try to fill the power vacuum and exert more influence in the region. This could lead to increased conflict and instability, as different groups compete for power. It's also possible that the withdrawal of U.S. troops could lead to a decrease in U.S. influence and credibility in the region, as other countries may see the U.S. as less committed to maintaining stability and security.",

      "[ Data corruption ] ( URL_0 ) happens when something goes wrong and the machine accidentally writes the wrong data , or overwrites the wrong part of the data , or deletes something that should n't have been deleted . This could be as simple as putting a 1 where a 0 should be , or it could be much more complex . Sometimes the machine can figure out what went wrong with the data and can correct it , but if it ca n't , the file can be unrecoverable .",
      "Data corruption is pretty simple , actually . Memory ( whether it 's read - only like a CD ROM or read / write like RAM ) is a device which stores a big long list of 0 's and 1 's . Those 0 's and 1 's are divided in to megabytes , kilobytes , and bytes ( and words , pages , sectors , and all kinds of other units ) . When your data becomes corrupted , it means that there 's a 0 where there SHOULD be a 1 . Most devices are smart enough to see this and fix the error ( it 's called \" parity checking \" - google that for a more detailed explanation of * how * a memory error is recovered ) . If there are enough misplaced 0 's and 1 's it becomes very difficult for the device to figure out what things should be - rather than trying to repair it , it bails out and says \" memory error ! \" Some read / write devices ( like RAM , hard drives , and USB memory ) may run into situations where it 's unable to properly read or write from a particular area of memory . This can be caused by a lot of things ( read / write arm does n't want to work there , it 's been destroyed by magnetism , etc ) . If this is the case , the device will usually black - list that part of memory and refuse to use it . After enough of the device gets black - listed , you end up with complete failure and have to buy a new device .",
      "When you save your game to the PS2 's memory card , a file is written to some flash memory - just like saving a text document to a USB flash drive . The data in the file is structured - it has specific fields in it that indicate different parts of the saved state of the game . For instance , there might be a section of the file that indicates the maximum health of your character , or whether or not you 've completed a specific quest . When the game goes to load this file off your card , if the data is wrong somehow - the maximum health is off the charts , or your inventory is full of items that do n't exist - then the save file is considered corrupt and ca n't be loaded . Corruption can occur for many reasons . One is that memory is n't always foolproof . Hard drives fail , flash memory can go bad , etc . It was especially bad in the earlier days of flash memory , so GameCube , Playstation , PS2 , etc memory cards were more error prone than the USB keys we use today . The technology has improved somewhat to be more fault tolerant and to work for longer . It 's also possible that the game had a glitch or was turned off while saving , thus writing an invalid or incomplete file to the card . It 's also possible that external conditions could damage the device ( and thus , the file stored on it ) over time . Since there 's typically nothing players can do to recover a corrupted save , the game typically just gives you a generic error and refuses to load the game ."

Each trooper is assigned a zone , and if we receive a call in their zone we generally ask them to respond . If all the troopers in their zone are unavailable , we ask the officer in charge to advise . The deputies have 4 zones with 6 deputies on duty . 4 deputies have their own zone ( so one in each zone ) and there is a float who will respond to any call if an officer is busy , and another call comes in in their zone . There is also a SGT on duty who is the boss of the crew . If a call comes in their zone , they are dispatched to it , and if deputies from another zone come to assist , the officer who is assigned to that zone will be in charge of the call ( write the big report , and if needed , take the prisoner into the jail ) . When we take a call our system automatically recognizes the address and maps it for us , and we can see whose zone it is in , and we send that unit . Generally , there is a unit available to assist if they need backup , and all officers in every agency will back each other if they feel they are in a dangerous situation . We have a computer aided dispatch system that tracks all of the calls , and what every unit is doing , so we know if they are available , unavailable , their location and how long they have been on that call so we can security check them if need be . I 'm not going into detail with any other agency besides the highway patrol and Sherrifs deputies because they all pretty much have one zone . I hope this covers at least a small chunk of curiosity . Feel free to ask more questions , because I 'm sure I 've probably made no sense . Oh , and they know the address because it shows up on their mobile dispatch center on their computer in their vehicle , and we always tell them when we dispatch them on the call .",
      "Depends on the size of the department . Large departments usually have computers in their cars to see what 's pending . They can assign themselves to it or the dispatcher can give them the basics and they look it up on the computer . But there is n't a uniform way things are done for all US agencies , so your local department could easily be very different .",
      "Short answer : 911 call comes in - > dispatcher takes call and documents information in a call log in the computer - > call goes to a radio - > radio dispatcher goes out over the air to unit using brevity codes ( these codes differ between agencies but tell the officers what type of call it is ) - > officer copies call and responds Address is given to the officer when call is dispatched along with any other important information ."

      "Sure, I'd be happy to explain how police dispatch works! \nWhen someone calls the police to report a problem or ask for help, the call goes to a special place called the \"police dispatch center.\" This is where people, called \"dispatchers,\" answer the phone and take down all the important information about the call. \nThe dispatcher asks the caller questions to get more details about what happened, where it happened, and whether anyone is hurt or in danger. The dispatcher then writes down all this information and sends it to the police officers who are closest to the place where the problem is happening. \nThe dispatcher also gives the police officers important details about the call, like the specific address of the place where the problem is happening or any description of the person involved. This helps the officers know where to go and what to look for when they get there. \nThe police officers use special radios to talk to the dispatcher and each other, so they can communicate and stay updated on what's happening. This is what you might be hearing on a scanner if you're listening to one. \nI hope this helps to clear things up! Let me know if you have any more questions.",

    "human_answer": [
      "Mostly it 's the lenses . Good lenses are fiendishly expensive , and can make the difference between a \" good \" picture and a fantastic picture . A surprisingly good and approachable video about lenses . It 's more focused on video , but the same holds true for still . URL_0",
      "Depends on the cameras . In some cases , absolutely . In others , definitely not . Most of the time though , the answer is ' sort of . ' A Hasselblad Stellar is entirely identical to a Sony RX-100 except for the case , but when it came out , sold for about five times the price . In this situation , the markup was entirely based on the cachet of owning a Hasselblad . ( Note : It did n't work . The design studio has been shut down , and the Stellar is selling for about 70 % off now . ) In general , a big part of the cost of a camera is derived from the sensor - specifically , the size of it . The Nikon D7100 is quite similar in design and features to the D600 , but the sensor in the D600 is substantially bigger ( full - frame ) , and the camera sells for about twice the price . Does the sensor cost that much more ? No , not really - but building a camera around it requires more engineering as well . Now if you have a built - in lens , your optics are going to get better as the price increases . That 's a HUGE factor in the price of a camera . Ultimately , cameras follow the same curve as almost every other consumer product : As you move from the low end to the high end , the improvement / price starts out high , then moves to a fairly steady value , then drops off . Say that to make a ( separate ) camera at all , you 'll have to sell it for $ 75 . That 's the base cost of making a body , shutter , electronics , and lens . Double the price , and you get MORE than twice as good of a camera - higher precision , better autofocus , more features , bigger and better lens , bigger sensor , the works . Double it again to $ 300 , and you get about twice as good of a camera as the $ 150 was . Another doubling , and you get about 1.6x as good of a camera . Now we 're getting into the diminishing returns area . The key here is n't whether a $ 1200 camera is twice as good as a $ 600 one , but whether it 's enough of an improvement that you are willing to pay an extra $ 600 for it . Is a $ 2400 camera twice as good as a $ 1200 ? Nope , definitely not - but it 's significantly better in a few ways , and those factors might be enough to get you to shell out the difference . Also , if you have $ 30k wrapped up in lenses , is it really outrageous to buy a camera body for $ 4k that is modestly better than a $ 1k one ? Ultimately , what do you want from your camera , and how much are you willing to spend on it ?",
      "It 's the quality of the components . You do pay a premium for the newest brand name models , so there 's not quite as much disparity as the price sometimes suggests , but for the most part cameras are one of the few products left where you do generally get what you pay for ( along with telescopes and binoculars too ) . The higher end cameras have much finer quality control in the manufacturing process . The crispness and brightness of the image is all dependent on the path the light takes from lens to processor , so you can imagine a perfectly manufactured route for the light is far superior to a lower quality one . Have you ever seen those youtube vids where kids will set up a rube goldbergian style path for a ball to bounce into a red solo cup ? Just how every trampoline or deflection point for that ball has to be perfectly positioned or it will miss the cup . You can think of high end cameras as balls that bounce cleanly into the cup , while lower end cameras still hit the cup , but maybe they skim around the rim and rock it a little . Hah , this analogy is not as good as I thought it would be so I 'll quit here . Tldr ; yep mostly there is that much difference between cheap and high ebd cameras ."

      "Split screen co-op gaming is a feature that allows players to play a game together on the same screen, with each player having their own section of the screen to see and control their own character or vehicle. This feature was popular in many games up until a few years ago, but it has become less common in recent years for a few reasons. \nOne reason is that many newer games are designed to be played online, rather than in person with another player sitting next to you on the same couch. This means that players can play the game together even if they are not in the same physical location, as long as they both have an internet connection. \nAnother reason is that split screen co-op can be more challenging for game developers to implement. It requires a lot of extra work to design the game in a way that allows two players to see and control their own characters on the same screen, and this can take up a lot of development time and resources. \nFinally, some people argue that split screen co-op is not as popular as it used to be because the trend in gaming has moved towards online multiplayer, which allows for a larger number of players to play together at the same time. \nOverall, split screen co-op is still possible in some games, but it is not as common as it used to be due to the increasing popularity of online multiplayer and the extra development work required to implement split screen co-op.",

      "The sound in reality is represented by a wave . In order to represent the wave in digital form , the sequence of numbers representing the wave amplitude measured periodically is used . The illustrations that probably will make it clear : [ 1 ] ( URL_2 ) , [ 2 ] ( URL_1 ) . When music is played back , the audio card converts this sequence of numbers back into the wave . Obviously , this conversion loses some quality : the resulting wave is an approximation of the original one .

Most common values are 44100 , 48000 , and 96000 . Bit depth is how many data is written for each measurement . 16 bits means that there are 2 ^ 16 = 65536 possible different values of amplitude . 24 bits means 16777216 different values .

This allows for a total of 65,536 possible amplitude values, which is a relatively fine level of resolution. \nA bit depth of 24 bits means that there are 24 bits available to represent the amplitude of the audio signal at each point in time. This allows for a total of 16,777,216 possible amplitude values, which is a much finer level of resolution than 16 bits. \nIn general, recordings made at a higher bit depth will have a higher quality and more dynamic range (the difference between the loudest and quietest parts of the recording).

    "human_answer": [
      "In the quantum model of atoms , electrons are not represented with points , since you ca n't determine where these electrons are /exactly/. Instead , you draw these balloon - shapes orbitals , which are sort of where the electrons are most likely found . In a molecule , these orbitals can overlap , and this overlap causes new hybrid orbitals to form .",
      "Everyone is familiar with the model of an atom where you have a positive nucleus , with negative electrons whizzing around in circles , we call these circles orbitals , where the orbital number goes up the further away from the nucleus you are . An electron can only be located in these orbitals , never between them , think of it like a ladder . You can climb up a ladder , but you only stand on each individual rung . This is , for many things , a good picture . However , we know that it is * not * how things actually look . We know this because physicists are really good at playing the \" if this , then ... \" game . Basically , if electrons were actually in circular orbits around the nucleus , the structure of the atom would n't be stable , and we would n't be here to ask any kind of question ( I can go further into this if you want , but I 'm mostly just trying to provide a backstory for why we have ) . So , what 's a better picture ? Well , the blob shapes that you 've seen / dealt with in molecular orbital theory . Here 's why . One of the most fundamental bits of quantum mechanics is something called the Schrodinger Equation ( SE ) . There is a lot of mathematical formalism that I 'll skip over here , but the SE is useful because it allows us to solve , given certain physical conditions , the behaviour of a particle . As a result of the SE , we learn that very small particles do n't behave in the way that say , a baseball would , where we can say \" The pitcher threw the ball , at this speed , and we can track it 's location from here , to here , to here , to ... \" Instead , we learn that tiny things , like electrons , have * probabilities * of being certain places , traveling certain speeds , etc , and when we measure one of those things ( see : Heisenberg uncertainty principle for more ) , we reduce how well we can know the other , because the act of measuring affects the actual thing . Think of it like if you had to measure where a baseball was between where the pitcher threw it and the batter hit it by smacking it with another baseball . Obviously , you would disturb it 's original trajectory , so you could n't know where it would be after you measure it with much certainty . So , physicists start solving the SE for specific things to see how a tiny particle would behave under certain circumstances that are very basic ; the most basic being the particle in the infinite potential well . Imagine a particle , stuck in a deep hole . It can bounce around , have more / less energy , but ca n't escape the hole . Let 's imagine that this is a very tiny particle now , so that we are dealing with the SE . Well , if we solve the SE we find that the particle can have different energy levels ( again , think rungs on a ladder ; so the particle can exist in different heights from the bottom of the hole ) . Our solutions to the SE are waves ( sine , cosine ) . When use follow the rules of probability theory and Born 's rule ( which is a rule about how we measure probabilities in quantum mechanics ) we can find that we can calculate the probability of [ where the particle is in our well ] ( URL_0 ) , given different energy levels . The peaks of the graphs represent the most likely place , while the nodes are zero probability . Eventually , physicists solve the SE for the specific set of circumstances that an electron would have if bound to a proton ; e.g. \" in orbit around a proton \" if you are still thinking in the orbital / planetary picture of an atom . An electron going around a proton ? Well , that 's a hydrogen atom . So , when the SE was solved for the hydrogen atom , in three dimensions , physicists could solve for the different energy levels ( orbital levels ) of the electron . This would be like the graph above , where there are areas of high probability , lower probability , and no probability ( like the space between orbitals , where the electron is not allowed ) . This graph though is more complicated because we have three dimensions now instead of one dimension . The \" blobs \" give you the areas where there is a probability of finding an electron , and , like the particle in a well , different energy levels ( n=1,2 , ... ) give differently shaped solutions . These arise because the solutions to the Hydrogen atom are a specific set of equations called spherical harmonics [ that give rise to solutions that look like this ] ( URL_1 ) . For atoms other than hydrogen , the system gets too complicated to solve in closed form , except for specific cases where an atom can sort of look like a hydrogen atom ( like if all the electrons have been stripped away except one ) . * However * physicists ( and chemists ! ) are a bunch of pretty smart guys , and take these solutions to qualitatively ( and sometimes quantitatively ) analyze a system . Bonding between atoms ( depending on the type of bond being formed ) happen when energy levels get crossed between atoms ; which happens in fairly specific ways , with some being more common than others because they are more energetically favourable . These blobs correspond to different \" strengths \" or bonding energies ( sigma , pi bonds ... ) . Chemists and physicists characterize the energy levels / shells by how they get filled with electrons . This is your 1s , 2p , etc . The rules of quantum mechanics , and solutions to the SE give you these different energy levels or \" shells . \" Even though it is * very * difficult ( or impossible ? ) to solve the SE for high Z atoms and molecules , we can solve ( sometimes numerically ) for these things by assuming certain forms of solutions ( the different blobs ) and knowing how likely things are to happen , and exploiting symmetries . These are the ( sometimes complicated ) rules that chemists know for how molecular bonding happens . Let me know if you have any more questions . I 'm decent at the physics , less familiar with the chemistry side ( it was a while ago that I had those classes ) . If others want to add / correct me on anything , please do . What I 've posted is my understanding of what OP asked , and does n't necessarily mean it 's 100 % correct , and the interpretation can sometimes be misguided .",
      "OK , well basically , electrons like to gather in groups , called Orbitals . These groups are separated by the amount of electrons in them and the shape they make . for example , a P - orbital has a total of six electrons inside it . These orbitals can be further divided into sub - orbitals , which have to electrons in , with opposite spins ( lets not go into what spin is , because frankly I do n't quite know , but IO do have a good analogy for the spin notation if you want to hear it . ) . These sub orbitals are shaped in certain ways . EG in a P - orbital each sub orbital makes a kind of dumbell / hourglass shape . What its important to understand with these orbitals , is that they are just fields where an electron is likely to be . electrons can exist anywhere within them , and can sometimes exist without them . They are just where the probability of the electron being there is high . Does this sound confusing ? Because , to be honest , it should . Electrons are buggers when it comes to understanding them properly ."

      "Molecular orbital theory is a way of understanding how the electrons in a molecule are arranged and how they behave. It helps us predict things like the shape of the molecule and how stable it is. \nImagine that you have a bunch of balls that you want to stack on top of each other. Each ball represents an electron. The balls are attracted to each other because of the electrical charge they carry, and they want to be as close together as possible. \nIn molecular orbital theory, we try to understand how the balls (electrons) are arranged in the stack (molecule) by creating \"orbital\" shapes that the balls can fit into. Each orbital can hold a certain number of balls, just like how a bucket can hold a certain number of marbles. \nThe shapes of the orbitals are determined by the behavior of the electrons in the molecule. Some orbitals are more stable than others, which means the balls (electrons) are less likely to fall out of them. This can help us understand why some molecules are more stable than others. \nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.",

      "The appendix is a small, tube-like organ that is located in the lower right side of the abdomen. It is not typically removed at birth because it does not always cause problems and can actually have some functions in the body. In some cases, the appendix can become inflamed and infected, which is called appendicitis. If this happens, the appendix can burst, or rupture, and release harmful bacteria into the abdominal cavity. This can be very serious and can lead to life-threatening infections. \nIn most cases, appendicitis is treated by removing the appendix through a surgical procedure called an appendectomy. This is usually done if the appendix is infected or if there is a high risk of it bursting. The decision to remove the appendix is usually based on the severity of the appendicitis and the overall health of the person. \nIt is not safe or necessary to remove the appendix at birth because most people do not develop appendicitis.

      "Sure! So, soap is made from a combination of oils or fats and an alkali, like lye. When you mix these two ingredients together and heat them up, a chemical reaction occurs that turns the mixture into soap. \nSoap works by breaking up the oils and dirt on your skin into smaller pieces, and then washing them away with water. The oils in soap are attracted to the dirt and oils on your skin, so when you rinse with water, the soap helps carry the dirt and oils away. \nAlkali is a type of chemical that can dissolve grease and oil, so it helps to break down the dirt and oils on your skin. This is why soap is especially good at cleaning your hands, which can get really dirty and greasy from handling food, using tools, and so on. \nThe soap that you see in bars or blocks is called \"bar soap.\" It's made by mixing the oils or fats and alkali together, and then letting the mixture harden in a mold. \nI hope this helps to explain how soap works!

    "human_answer": [
      "TLDR - ports are mailboxes . Port forwarding forwards the mail from mailbox X to mailbox Y. Think of ports as mailboxes . Let 's say you wanted to hand deliver a letter to Joe at the Acme Brick company . You would go to the address of the Acme Brick Company . The company employs 5,000 people . So you would see a grid of boxes with people 's names on them . You find the one that belongs to Joe and you put the letter in there . This is kind of how computer 's talk to each other . The street address is the IP address of the computer ( say 192.168.1.1 ) and the grid of mailboxes is the port . If you want to talk to a computer via http , you would send your information and requests to port 80 . If you wanted to talk to them with a different protocol like RDP , you would talk to 3389 . If you wanted to talk to the SMTP service on that computer , you 'd talk to port 25 . You are going to that computer and putting your correspondence in a particular mailbox ( port ) . Now , let 's say that Joe is a secret agent who works for the Acme Brick Company . To you , he 's known as Joe . To everyone inside the company , he 's known as Bob . This identity may be so super - secret that Bob does n't even know what name you know him by . You just know him as Joe . You want to talk to Joe so you go to the Acme Brick Company , you find their grid of mailboxes and you put your letter in Joe 's mailbox . Some poor mail clerk on the other side ( your router ) know 's Joe 's secret identity . So he takes the mail from Joe 's box and put 's it in Bob 's mailbox . This way Bob can pick it up . This is port forwarding .",

      "Here 's the simple example . Say you 're falling in a vacuum near the Earth 's surface , you experience a force : F = g x m ; this force causes you to accelerate down as m x a = g x m therefore a = g regardless of your mass ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "Sure! In general relativity, gravity is not a force that acts between masses like it is in classical physics. Instead, gravity is a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of matter or energy. Imagine that spacetime is like a rubber sheet, and objects with mass or energy cause a depression in the rubber sheet. The curvature of the rubber sheet then causes other objects to be \"pulled\" towards the massive object, as if it were a gravitational force. \nNow, imagine that you are standing on a trampoline with a bowling ball in the center. If you were to roll a smaller ball towards the bowling ball, the smaller ball would be \"pulled\" towards the bowling ball due to the depression in the trampoline caused by the bowling ball's mass. This is similar to how objects are \"pulled\" towards each other due to gravity in general relativity. \nBut what does this have to do with acceleration? In classical physics, acceleration is the rate at which an object's velocity changes over time. In general relativity, an object's velocity is determined by the path it follows through spacetime. If the path is curved, the object will appear to be accelerating, even if it is not actually changing its velocity. \nFor example, imagine that you are standing on the trampoline again, but this time you are rolling a ball in a straight line towards the bowling ball. As the ball approaches the bowling ball, it will start to follow the curve of the trampoline, and it will appear to be accelerating towards the bowling ball. This is similar to how an object orbiting a massive object, like the Earth orbiting the Sun, appears to be accelerating towards the Sun, even though it is actually following a straight path through curved spacetime. \nI hope this helps!

      "Imagine you are in class and your teacher asks you to write all of the capital letters of the alphabet four times - A A A A B B B B C C C C .... You know that you 'll have to write a little more than 100 letters on the page . You can guess how long it takes you to write a single letter , but writing can sometimes be faster or slower . This is true for computers too . A loading bar in computers is basically the same as the teacher asking you every second , \" JPK , how much time do you still need to finish writing your letters ? \" If you took 2 seconds to write the first letter , and you need to write 100 , you could guess that you need 198 seconds to finish . But if it took you 3 seconds for the letter B ( curves ! ) or 1 second for the letter C ( do n't need to lift the pencil ! ) then your guesses will be a little bit wrong every time . Now what happens if you drop your pencil ? ( In this analogy , after flushing data to disk , the computer switched tasks to take care of something of higher priority , like opening the reddit home page in your browser ) Suddenly your time changes a little bit more because you have to take time to pick up your pencil ( task switch ) , or to sharpen your pencil ( file seeking ) , or to erase a mistake ( error checking ) , or to write your name on the assignment ( file system journaling ) or to put a page down and get a new page ( storing in cache or page memory ) . It was very easy to guess when you only had to think about how fast you wrote the first letter .... but clearly it is n't enough information to figure out the entire time remaining . ---- As far as the last 1 % goes , this is kind of like doing your entire assignment first before you write your name and date and class and give your pages to the teacher . The loading bar usually estimates time remaining based on the task it represents , since it can actually be measured by looking at past progress . That last percent often includes tasks that can not be measured . For example , when you download files , they are usually downloaded to a temp directory first , then moved to the real destination ( or they are downloaded at the real directory but with a fake extension , like myfile.jpg.part ; then the file is renamed to myfile.jpg when the download is complete ) .",

It's often used when a computer or website is doing a lot of work, such as loading a webpage or downloading a file. The loading bar shows you how much of the work has been done and how much is left to do. \nSometimes loading bars don't work very well because the task they are showing the progress of is taking a long time to complete. This can be because the computer or website is busy doing other things, or because the task is just very large and takes a long time to finish. \nAnother reason loading bars might not work very well is if they are not programmed correctly. If the loading bar is not accurately showing the progress of the task, it can be frustrating for the person using the computer or website. \nOverall, loading bars are a useful tool for showing how much progress has been made on a task, but they can sometimes be slow or not work correctly if the task is taking a long time to complete or if they are not programmed correctly.",

Gold is the easiest of the metals to work . It occurs in a virtually pure and workable state , whereas most other metals tend to be found in ore - bodies that pose some difficulty in smelting . Gold 's early uses were no doubt ornamental , and its brilliance and permanence ( it neither corrodes nor tarnishes ) linked it to deities and royalty in early civilizations . Gold CoinsGold has always been powerful stuff . The earliest history of human interaction with gold is long lost to us , but its association with the gods , with immortality , and with wealth itself are common to many cultures throughout the world . Early civilizations equated gold with gods and rulers , and gold was sought in their name and dedicated to their glorification . Humans almost intuitively place a high value on gold , equating it with power , beauty , and the cultural elite . And since gold is widely distributed all over the globe , we find this same thinking about gold throughout ancient and modern civilizations everywhere . Gold , measured out , became money . Gold 's beauty , scarcity , unique density ( no other metal outside the platinum group is as heavy ) , and the ease by which it could be melted , formed , and measured made it a natural trading medium .

The program has been the subject of controversy because many people believe that torture is wrong, regardless of the circumstances. \nThere are several reasons why people are angry about the CIA torture program: \n1. Many people believe that torture is wrong because it goes against fundamental human rights and dignity. The United States has long held that all people have certain inalienable rights, including the right to be free from torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. By torturing terrorism suspects, the CIA was violating these fundamental rights. \n2. The effectiveness of torture as an interrogation technique has been called into question. Many experts believe that torture is not an effective way to gather reliable information, as people who are being tortured will often say anything to make the torture stop, even if it is not true. In addition, the use of torture can create a climate of fear and mistrust, which can make it more difficult to gather accurate intelligence. \n3. The CIA torture program was carried out in secret, and many people believe that it was done in an effort to cover up the program and avoid accountability. When governments operate in secret, it can be difficult for citizens to hold them accountable for their actions, and this can undermine trust in government and the rule of law. \n4. The CIA torture program has also been criticized because it was carried out at detention facilities in other countries, including countries with a history of human rights abuses. This has led some people to question whether the United States is upholding its own values and principles when it comes to human rights. \nOverall, the CIA torture program has been a source of controversy because it involves the use of torture and other forms of abuse, which many people believe is wrong, and because it was carried out in secret and may have violated fundamental human rights.",

Our ears are sensitive to high-pitched sounds and they can sometimes be painful or uncomfortable to listen to. The sound might also remind us of something that is unpleasant or dangerous, like nails on a chalkboard, which could make us feel uncomfortable or upset. Ultimately, the reason why this sound might be unpleasant to some people is because it is simply not a very pleasant sound to listen to. Does that help?",

      "It is difficult to accurately estimate the total worth of the Catholic Church, as it is not a business and does not operate in the same way as a traditional company. The Catholic Church is a global organization with a complex structure that includes a range of institutions, including churches, schools, hospitals, and charitable organizations. Many of these institutions are independently run and funded, and the Church also receives donations from individuals and organizations. Additionally, the Church has significant investments and holdings, including real estate and art collections. All of these factors make it challenging to determine a specific financial value for the Catholic Church. It is important to note that the Catholic Church is a religious organization, and its primary purpose is not to generate financial profit. Its primary focus is on spreading the teachings of Jesus Christ and serving the spiritual needs of its members.",

A cat might develop a phobia of water if it had a negative experience with water. \nWild animals can also have phobias. For example, some wild animals might be afraid of certain predators, even if the predator is not actually present. They might also be afraid of loud noises or other things that they associate with danger. \nOverall, phobias are a natural way for animals (and people) to protect themselves from potential dangers.

      "Stars twinkle due to atmospheric interference . If you 've ever seen \" heat waves \" shimmering above a road , you 're seeing a similar principle at work .

Light bends when it moves through something . That something can be anyting : solid ( like a drinking glass ) , liquid ( like water ) , or a gas ( the air in our atmosphere ) Bending does n't make it twinkle though . If you look through a window , light is also bend , but because its always bend in the same fashion , you ca n't even notice it . Twinkling comes in when the bending is happening randomly . Like the air above your head . Patches of air are randomly cold , and warm , and moved about by the wind . This has a tiny effect on the bending of the light , and thus the star appears to twinkle",

      "Stars twinkle because of the Earth's atmosphere. The light from a star travels through the atmosphere to reach us on the ground. As the light travels through the atmosphere, it can be affected by different layers of air with different temperatures and densities. This can cause the light to bend or scatter in different directions. \nWhen you see a star twinkling, what you're actually seeing is the light from the star being affected by the Earth's atmosphere as it travels through it. The twinkling effect is caused by the light being scattered in different directions as it passes through the atmosphere, which makes it appear to be flashing or changing in brightness. \nIt's important to note that the star itself is not actually twinkling or changing in brightness.

    "human_answer": [
      "It allows teachers to have different grading scales . So I might make a really hard class but give people with an 85 an A. Or I may have a class that you need at least a 75 to pass either because the information from class is required to move on or because I require more from my students .",
      "The short answer is , because it gives the information the Universities care about . A longer version ... for grades , generally a University cares about 2 things , which are closely related . How well a student has mastered material , and how capable a student is of mastering material . If a student is about average , they should be receiving a C , good , B , amazing , A. So why does n't this translate directly to percentages ? In short , because not all professors are good at translating an assessment of their knowledge to standard percentages . Take something like Quantum Physics ; I 've had a class where the average on a midterm was ~20 - 30 % , with the amazing students getting 40 % . Now , that may speak to the professor being terrible ( for some definition of terrible ) , it may speak to terrible students , or it may be because the test was designed to be so difficult that a student could only complete 2 - 3 out of 5 problems in the time given , but half the test was in recognizing which of those problems a student could complete best . If the whole class is designed like this , and \" percentages \" are used , someone outside looking at the scores from the class would simply only view a student 's score in isolation , see it as depressingly low , and view it as a mark against the student , even if they had the highest score in the class . Grades , then , are a way for the professor of the class to say \" Well , I was using a teaching / grading method that does n't match up exactly to your expectation of 90%+ = Great student , anything below 60 is awful , but here 's a way to view my evaluations in a standardized way . \"",
      "Something else that has n't been mentioned yet , sometimes the school does n't want you to get tied up in minor differences . Say Student A got 95 % and Student B got 94 % . Does this make Student A \" better \" ? Looking at percentages , it may certainly seem so , but most people would also realise that many other factors like condition on the day of exam also have an effect . So schools basically smooth things over and give both of them the same grade . Edit : To add , the CFA exams are perhaps an extreme example of this , as the only possible results are Pass or Fail .

      "The GPA system is a way of measuring academic achievement in the United States that assigns a numerical value to a student's grades. The 4-point GPA scale is the most commonly used scale in the United States, and it assigns a numerical value to each letter grade, with 4.0 being the highest possible GPA and 0.0 being the lowest. \nThere are a few reasons why the GPA system is used in the United States instead of percentage grades. First, the GPA system allows for a more nuanced understanding of a student's grades. While a percentage grade gives a general idea of how well a student has performed, the GPA system allows for more precise comparisons between students. \nSecond, the GPA system is more flexible than percentage grades. For example, if a student receives a 90% on one assignment and an 80% on another, their average percentage grade would be 85%. However, if the first assignment was worth twice as much as the second assignment, the student's grades would be weighted differently, and the GPA would reflect that. \nFinally, the GPA system is more widely used in the United States, so it is easier for universities to compare the grades of students from different schools. This can be particularly helpful when evaluating the academic achievements of international students, as different countries may use different grading systems. \nOverall, the GPA system is a convenient and widely accepted way of measuring academic achievement in the United States. It allows for more precise comparisons between students and is more flexible than percentage grades.",

For example, some people have criticized McDonald's for using processed and unhealthy ingredients in its food, or for contributing to environmental problems due to its large scale. \nIt's also possible that McDonald's has simply faced more criticism and negative publicity because it is an easy target.

      "In a vacuum, objects fall at the same speed regardless of their mass because there is no air resistance to slow them down. This is known as the principle of universal gravitation. \nImagine you are standing on a tall building and you drop a feather and a coin at the same time. Without air resistance, the feather and the coin will fall to the ground at the same speed. This is because the only force acting on them is the force of gravity, which is pulling them towards the ground. The mass of the feather and the coin does not affect how fast they fall, only the force of gravity does. \nNow, if you were to drop the feather and the coin in air (not in a vacuum), the feather would fall more slowly than the coin because the air would create a resistance force that slows the feather down. The coin, being more dense and heavier, would not be slowed down as much by the air and would therefore fall faster than the feather. \nI hope this helps!

      "The email protocols that are generally used such as SMTP were written back when 10 MB was stupidly large . To download it on a typical home connection would take several hours , if not days . SMTP servers generally work by passing the email from one to another to another ( although there are now things in the address resolution protocols that allow them to talk directly to the receiving server for efficiency ) .

Nowadays it 's often higher than that but you ca n't tell without trying it , and next time your email may take a different route , so 10 MB is a ' safe ' lowest common denominator . Also , many corporate email servers find it convenient to leave the 10 MB limit in place even though they could easily change it because that reduces the amount of data they have to archive , backup or even keep for years for legal reasons . Having a 10 MB limit forces people to use other methods like SharePoint or shared folders , or offsite solutions like Dropbox if the business rules allow it .",

      "Sending large emails with attachments can be difficult because of the way that email works. When you send an email, it has to travel from your computer or device to the email server and then to the recipient's email server. Along the way, it can pass through many different servers and networks, and each of these servers and networks has limited resources. If the attachment is too large, it can use up too much of the resources of these servers and networks, making it difficult to send the email. \nAdditionally, many email providers have size limits on the attachments that you can send in order to prevent people from sending very large attachments that could cause problems for the servers and networks. These size limits are often set to around 10 MB or less to ensure that emails can be sent and received quickly and reliably. \nSo, while we do have the technology to send large attachments, it can be difficult because of the way that email works and the need to ensure that it is fast and reliable for everyone who uses it.",

    "human_answer": [
      "Because of a relationship between absorptivity and emissivity described by [ Kirchoff 's Law of thermal radiation ] ( URL_0 ) . In short : The reason why black is more emissive is because it absorbs more radiation in thermal equilibrium and thus must also radiate more to maintain that equilibrium . Why heatsinks are n't black is because plain aluminium is still quite emissive in infra - red ( where it matters ) and because black paint may have lower thermal conductivity than bare metal , reducing the primary method of cooling , convection , as plain radiation is a far less important method of cooling .",
      "Emissivity is very highly dependent on wavelength . Heat is emitted mostly in the infrared spectrum , a color that the human eye can not perceive . But heat is also emitted at other wavelength , including visible light , but at levels too low to detect until the emission is so high the item \" glows \" . Black color pigment is a combination that absorbs ( and emits ) heat and light of all wavelengths . So having something black increases the number of wavelengths that can efficiently emit , increasing overall emissivity . But , most heat sinks operate well below the visible threshold , so visible color is less important . And we all know that we would rather have a colorful heatsink to look at than some flat black hunk of metal . It 's actually much more important that the product have a matte or flat appearance than the color it is . The reason for that is that on a microscopic scale a matte surface is bumpy and a shiny surface is smooth , and the bumpy surface has a larger surface area than a flat one . Cross section of Matte paint : /\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ Cross section of Gloss paint : ---------------------------------",
      "u / AdarTan mentioned the real answer , but they made it sound like an afterthought . The best answer is that emissivity does n't matter for heatsinks . When there 's a fluid ( e.g. air ) present , convection is nearly always more significant than radiation .

    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "Emissivity is a measure of how well an object is able to emit or radiate heat. Some materials are better at emitting heat than others. A material's emissivity can be increased by making its surface rougher, or by painting it a darker color. \nFlat black paint is often used to increase an object's emissivity because it absorbs a large amount of light and heat. When an object is painted black, it absorbs more of the energy that hits its surface, rather than reflecting it back. This absorbed energy can then be radiated back out as heat, which can help to cool the object. \nHeat sinks are designed to dissipate or spread out heat to help cool electronic devices. While painting a heat sink flat black could increase its emissivity, it might not be the most effective way to cool the device. This is because heat sinks rely on air flow to dissipate heat, and a flat black paint job could interfere with this air flow. In addition, the heat sink might get too hot to touch if it is painted black, which could be a safety issue. \nOverall, painting something flat black can increase its emissivity, but it might not always be the best solution for cooling an object.",

    "question": "in video games , why are shadows so hard to render ? I notice that even in games with incredibly detailed graphics shadows are often pixelated or very low resolution . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Drawing shadows is hard . The way shadows are calculated is by placing a second camera at the light source , and then rendering the scene from the light source 's point of view into a temporary location . The image that is produced is not a typical \" camera image \" . Instead every pixel of this image records the distance between the light source and the object hit by the light - this is called a \" shadow map \" . Once you have this shadow map , the regular scene is drawn . While drawing the regular scene , it has to calculate the lighting for each pixel in the regular scene . Let 's say a particular pixel on the regular scene represents location X in the scene ( it has an exact 3D location in the scene ) . The distance of location X to the light source is compared against the distance recorded in the shadow map , this determines whether location X is in shadow or not . In other words , rendering shadows requires rendering an extra scene ( the shadow map ) for * each * light source in the scene , greatly reducing FPS . So a game with just one light source with accurate shadows would have its FPS halved , 2 light sources would cause FPS to be reduced to 1/3 . This is somewhat circumvented by rendering low resolution shadow maps instead ( less pixels to render per shadow map ) , resulting in pixelated or low resolution shadows , because each pixel on the shadow map covers a \" larger \" area . Edit : Halving and 1/3 FPS is a huge exaggeration , it is not that bad ( because ELI5 ) , it ignores the CPU side of calculating the scene , updating AIs , etc . The point I 'm driving across is simply that more scenes are drawn per frame .",
      "I 'm a graphics engine programmer by profession , so I 've programmed engines that handle real - time shadows quite a few times . There are different techniques to shadows , each one costs something in performance and has drawbacks . ----- * * Stencil shadows * * , used in Doom 3 and F.E.A.R. , calculate what areas should be occluded ( within shadow ) by taking a light source and tracing lines from the light source to each vertex on a polygon , this is mostly done on the CPU . Where these lines pass through polygons a new mesh is created , which is rendered to the stencil buffer and creates sharp shadows that describe where the meshes are visible ( Basically where those lines from the light connect with polygons ) . This effectively generates a sharp representation of shadows against surfaces ( more or less generates something that describes the clipping of shadows ) . It is mathematically intensive and requires a fast CPU , something that game consoles do n't typically have when compared with desktop PCs so this method performs better on PCs where a CPU is quite powerful . This method is not used very much these days . ----- The other technique which is quite popular these days ( easy to implement ) is * * shadow mapping * * , which takes advantage of the GPU to draw what each light \" sees \" by moving the camera to where the light is facing , drawing what it sees to just the depth buffer ( So it knows how far away what it is seeing is ) . Once the depth information is gathered , the camera moves back to the normal view and draws the world normally , however it keeps the shadow camera 's depth buffer and position at hand and when the GPU is drawing the material of objects you 're looking it ( textures , lighting , etc ) it will check the position of the object you 're looking at , then it will use the equation for the shadow camera 's position and find out how far away that position is from the shadow camera , then it uses the shadow camera 's depth buffer to see if it is further away than the depth value in the same X / Y position on that depth buffer . If it is , then it is in shadow , if it is n't , then it is in light . This option moves the intense maths to the GPU but costs GPU memory for the shadow cameras ' depth buffers , also you need to repeat the operation for every single shadow - casting light source , which means you are drawing the game world multiple times in one frame . Very expensive . To have more accurate shadows you need a higher resolution depth texture , which means slower pixel lookups , more memory used , worse performance * * < - This is why you have pixellated shadows * * Also you do n't always want hard shadows , so some materials will define how blurry the shadow it receives is which means extra maths for the GPU to do . Consoles can cope with this better as they have powerful GPUs compared to their CPUs , PCs also benefit from this as it scales well with hardware ( So if you can support high resolution shadows you can choose to use them ) . Games typically only use 1 shadow source for shadow mapping ( the Sun ) because they want to dedicate more time to making the rest of the scene look good rather than having multiple shadows , some of which you wo n't even see . And all this needs to be done in under 16.666~ milliseconds for 60 FPS . ----- Here 's a summary of shadow mapping ; 1 . Move camera to shadow - casting light 2 . Draw what that light \" sees \" to its own depth buffer 3 . Repeat N times for every shadow that effects the scene 4 . Move camera to player point of view 5 . Upload all shadow depth buffers to GPU 6 . Upload all camera matrices for each shadow casting light 7 . Draw what the player sees as normal 8 . Draw materials ( textures , etc ) 9 . Take the world position of the fragment ( pixel ) that is being drawn 10 . Translate that with each matrix of the shadow camera to get its position on the depth buffer in the perspective of the shadow camera 11 . Check if the fragment we want to draw is \" behind \" the fragment that is in the same position on the shadow cameras ' depth buffers 12 . If it is behind a depth buffer fragment , render as if in shadow ( Darken it by some factor , check samples around the same point to see how blurry the shadow is , calculate new material values , etc , etc ) ----- From the \" Draw materials ( textures , etc ) \" point onwards everything is done on the fragment shader , which means that those steps are repeated for every visible pixel and every pixel that you ca n't see ( so stuff drawn behind objects that are about to be covered up by objects ) , and with matrix mathematics being so expensive you can imagine that doing all that for every pixel in a 1920x1080 image is very expensive , hence why most games stick with 1 shadow source and choose to make that 1 look really good . ----- Extra ; I saw someone mention * * pre - baked shadows * * , this moves the shadow rendering stage to the content generation stage which means highly accurate shadows can be produced and the only performance cost is having an extra texture for the surface shadow ( Unless your engine is clever and streams textures with the pre - baked shadows on them , i d Tech 5 ) . The obvious draw - back to pre - baked shadows is that they can not move . The less - obvious draw - back ( that Doom 3 attempted to solve ) is that the models in the world wo n't be shadowed in the same way as the pre - baked textures as models are expected to move around , this means they need a different lighting model to the world which means they will always look out of place . This is known as the \" Hanna - Barbera effect \" , where things that move look very much out of place compared to the background they are drawn on . ----- Extra 2 ; Another shadowing concept that is usually forgotten about is * * ambient occlusion * * , which is where light photons bounce off objects and slightly illuminate areas that are in shadow . This causes an effect where two surfaces near each other will have photons bounce more and more between the surfaces , losing energy as they do , which causes the surfaces to produce dark shadows closer to where they meet . Games cheat this by using a technique first shown in Crysis ( 2007 ) where the depth buffer is once again used to check how close objects are to each other , where the objects are close it will draw a fuzzy dark patch which is later blurred with a gaussian blur to produce the ambient occlusion for the scene . This is then used with the final rendered frame to produce further shadows . Ambient occlusion can also be pre - baked , as it is in games such as Team Fortress 2 . ----- Extra 3 ; The latest way to do shadows is * * voxel cone tracing * * where we convert the light data of the world into a voxel representation and trace between voxels to illuminate objects , rather than to cast shadows . This technique was developed for real - time global - illumination but it also works for calculating shadows . This technique is really good as it produces incredibly accurate shadows depending on voxel resolution and scales very nicely , but the draw - back is that it is difficult to implement as most of the algorithm is too slow to run on a CPU but runs very nicely across the many GPU cores , so CUDA or OpenCL is used . The was a technique developed before the XBone / PS4 consoles were announced and it was running very well on PC hardware of the time , Unreal Engine 4 even adopted the technique pretty much the moment it had a white paper published , however the XBone and PS4 specs were announced and both consoles are significantly weaker than we all thought they would be , so this technique has been retired early and will probably reappear in the next generation of consoles . ----- Extra 4 ; Some people are discussing * * blob shadows * * , which are n't intensive at all and are relatively cheap . There 's many ways to do a blob shadow , usually it is done by just having a square at the feet of objects with a blob texture on it , but the problem with this is that the shadow floats in the air if you are standing on the edge of geometry . The best way is to grab information about the intersecting terrain of the shadow , generate a new mesh that overlays on that terrain and apply a decal texture of a blob shadow . Super Mario 64 uses a neat trick where the blob shadow is on a circular mesh that is split into pie - like sections , when a section hangs over the edge of a surface it is made invisible , this is a good mix between the first technique of blob shadows and the second technique . Another form of shadows similar to blob is to flatten the objects at their base and render them to a colour buffer with no transparency and a black colour , then this shadow buffer can be made semi - transparent and drawn over the final colour buffer ( with some depth testing ) to get some simple shadows - at - the - feet of objects , but again they will hang over geometry , which is where the clipping is needed .",
      "The reason why shadows is expensive to calculate is because shadows have to take into consideration how objects affect themselves and other objects . Other basic 3D rendering techniques ( lighting , texturing ) deal with objects in a scene independent of other objects ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "Rendering shadows in video games can be challenging because it requires the computer to calculate how the light in the virtual environment should interact with the objects in the scene. This can be a lot of work for the computer, especially if there are a lot of objects or the objects are moving around. \nOne way that shadows are often rendered in video games is by using something called a shadow map. A shadow map is a special texture that stores information about the shadows in the scene. The computer can then use this information to quickly draw the shadows on the objects in the scene. However, shadow maps can only store so much information, so the shadows might not always look as detailed as you would like. \nAnother reason that shadows might not look as detailed in video games is because the developers might have chosen to prioritize other aspects of the game, such as the characters or the environment. This means that they might not have had as much time or resources to spend on making the shadows look as good as possible. \nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

      "It is not acceptable for anyone to enter a private space, such as a locker room or restroom, with the intention of harassing or disturbing others. However, it is perfectly acceptable for a person to use the restroom or locker room that aligns with their gender identity. \nAllowing people to use the facilities that correspond with their gender identity is a matter of basic dignity and respect. It is not about sexual attraction. It is about allowing people to use the facilities that match the gender they identify as, so that they can go about their daily lives with privacy and comfort. \nThink about it this way: if you were a man who identified as a woman, would you feel comfortable using the men's locker room? Probably not. The same is true for a woman who identifies as a man. Using the facilities that correspond with their gender identity allows them to go about their day without feeling anxious, embarrassed, or unsafe.",

Sidenote : this is also why they almost always serve pickled ginger or daikon radish with sushi . Usually when you order sushi , you get a few different types with varying ingredients . You 're supposed to eat some of the pickled garnish before trying each type so that your palate gets refreshed . That way you can fully taste the differences and delicate flavors of each different type of sushi as you progress through the meal .",

      "Light is the fastest thing there is . Nothing can go faster . It 's just a law of nature , it 's the ultimate speed limit . Mass ' causes ' gravity . The more mass something has the more gravity it has . Like Earth . If you want to get off Earth you need to have a certain speed . That 's called ' exit velocity ' . It 's the minimum amount of speed you have to have to get away from Earth . The more mass you have the higher the escape velocity is . Blackholes are so massive that the escape velocity is higher than the speed of light , so not even light can get out of a blackhole . Everything gets sucked into and gone forever .

When a massive star runs out of fuel to burn in its fusion it collapses under its own weight . That much mass in that little space creates an extremely dense white dwarf , or in the case of super massive stars ( tens or even hundreds of time the mass of the sun ) a black hole . A big misconception about black holes is that they 're like big vacuum cleaners sucking up everything around them .

      "A black hole is a place in space where the normal laws of physics break down. It's a place where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape from it, not even light. Black holes are formed when a star collapses, or collapses in on itself, at the end of its life. \nImagine you have a ball that is really heavy. The ball has so much mass, or weight, that it makes a deep dent in the ground when you drop it. Now imagine a ball that is even heavier. It would make an even deeper dent in the ground. Now imagine a ball that is so heavy, it makes a dent that is so deep, it goes all the way through the ground and keeps going. That's what a black hole is like. It's a place where the pull of gravity is so strong that it sucks everything in and doesn't let it escape. \nBlack holes come in different sizes. The smallest ones are called \"stellar\" black holes and are only a few times heavier than our sun. The largest ones are called \"supermassive\" black holes and can be billions of times heavier than our sun. Scientists have found evidence of black holes in our own galaxy and in many other galaxies. They are still studying and learning more about them, but we know that black holes are some of the strangest and most mysterious objects in the universe.",

For instance , The Tea Party tends to be accurately libertarian when it comes to fiscal - in - the - government issues , but absolutely not very libertarian at all when it comes to social - in - the - government issues . So they want to use the libertarian platform to push their own social agenda ( which tends toward conservatism ) . Actual libertarianism , as anon33249038 stated , is about recognizing people 's rights and the freedom for individuals to choose their actions as long as they 're not encroaching on anyone else 's rights . A good example of this might be drug use ... as long as the individual 's drug use does n't impact someone else 's rights , it is considered a \" victimless crime \" and should not be illegal . Once that drug use begins to encroach on someone else 's rights , there is now a victim , and that victim 's rights should be upheld .",

Anarcho - capitalism is sort of the far end of the spectrum , whose proponents believe the state can be done away with altogether and replaced by private businesses .

    "question": "How do sail boats go faster than the wind ? The Americas Cup sailboats can go nearly 2 times windspeed . How do they go faster than the wind is blowing them ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "They are actually sailing parallel to the wind and/or upwind , which is not with the flow of the wind . The sails act like a wing , creating lift which is counteracted by the keel to result in forward motion . Since they are sailing into the wind , they never outrun the wind , instead as they go faster , the apparent wind speed increases . Sailing straight downwind ( with the wind ) , you ca n't go faster than the wind .",
      "The common way that a lot of people think of a sail is as if it were a big parachute . With this conceptualization you have a big sheet of cloth and the wind pushes it from behind . This kind of sailboat can only go as fast as the wind pushes it . However , that 's the wrong mental picture . The goal of a sail is actually to get the wind to move along the sail , like the air moves over the wing of an aircraft . Just as an aircraft gets lift from its wings a sailboat gets \" lift \" from its sail , but that \" lift \" is directed forward instead of up . This approach does not limit the speed of the boat to the speed of the wind . It even allows the boat to sail nearly directly upwind .",
      "There are two basic ways a sail can drive a boat onward . 1 . If the wind is coming from behind , or at not too big an angle behind , the boat , then the sail is trimmed ( basically , aimed ) so that the wind fills the sail from behind . The wind pushes the boat along , as you 'd expect . If the boat were to reach the speed of the wind , any further increase in the boat 's speed would cause the wind to start pushing it * back * . So , in that configuration , the boat ca n't go faster than the wind . 2 . Once the wind is more than about 45 degrees off from the stern ( rear ) of the boat , though , the sail is trimmed such that the * front edge * of the sail is pointing into the wind . The wind is now flowing * along * the sail on both sides of it . As the boat turns further and further towards the wind , the sail gets pulled in further and further , so that its front edge is aimed into the wind and the wind is flowing along both sides . This works until the boat is heading about 45 degrees upwind - that is , the wind is coming in at a 45 degree angle off the bow ( front ) of the boat . How the sail works in this case , I 'll explain a bit further down . 3 . When the boat is pointing closer than 45 degrees into the wind , that will stop working . You can no longer get the right sail shape , and the wind will just push against the boat and slow it down and eventually stop it . So the people in other comments saying you can sail almost directly upwind are mistaken . You ca n't practically sail very close to directly upwind , you have to be a significant angle off . This is why , when boats are trying to get directly upwind , you 'll see the zigzag , and you 'll notice each zig and zag is approximately a 90 degree turn - because they 're close to 45 degrees off the wind in one direction , and then the other , as they work their way upwind . So , how does the sail work when the boat is pointing somewhere between about 45 degrees upwind and 45 degrees downwind ? It 's all about the shape of the sail . Imagine yourself looking down on the boat from directly above the mast . The wind is blowing the sail into a sort of billow form . If it could , the wind would blow the sail all the way straight in whatever direction the wind is going , like a flag , but it ca n't . A sail is not like a flag in a very important way - the bottom of it is attached to a big straight bar , called the boom . So the sail must stay straight at the bottom , all the way to the rear corner . But , and this is just as important , the sail is n't a plain flat triangle either . It has a bunch of extra fabric ; it 's bigger in the middle than is needed to fill the space between the lines if it were just flat . So there 's extra material to billow out , and the wind , trying to blow the sail off to the side , turns it into a curve . Because of the shape of the sail and how much extra material is in which parts , the sail forms a shape with a sharper ballooning out right at the front , and a shallower curve towards the rear . If you 're looking at this from above , this shape looks very much like what the cross - section of an airplane wing looks like from the side . It works in the same way . I 'm not going to fully ELI5 how that works right here , but the simplest way to imagine it is that the wind creates * suction * on the rear side of the sail . Think of it like this , sort of : Along the inside of the sail 's curve , the side in the direction the wind is coming from , the wind is directly hitting the sail and being curved by it . So here , the wind is partly pushing against the sail . But on the outside of the sail 's curve , the side away from the direction the wind is coming from , the wind going past the mast would just keep on moving past where the sail is , except that direction of motion of the air would pull some air away from the sail . It causes the wind to curve in towards the sail after it has passed it , but it 's not actually blowing against the sail , it 's still blowing kind of away from the sail . It 's pulling air away from the sail . It 's creating a kind of suction , sucking the sail in that direction . It 's pulling the sail towards the direction in which it 's billowing . Now , you might 've noticing , looking down at the boat from above , that this direction the wind is sucking the sail towards is n't actually directly towards the front of the boat . And you 're right - if the boat were flat on the bottom , it would start sliding partly sideways , partly forward . But sailboats have something called a keel ( if it 's permanently fixed ) or centerboard ( if it 's made to slide into and out of the water ) , which sticks out from the bottom of the boat deep into the water . This keel is a thing but wide blade shape that allows the boat to easily slide forward or backward , but presents a lot of resistance against sliding sideways . So all of the sideways component of the force coming from the sail gets wasted pushing water against the side of the keel / centerboard , but the forward component of the force from the sail moves the boat forward . Even though the boat is actually being pushed at an angle sideways - forward , it only moves forward . Now here 's the most important part for answering your question : This motion of the wind along the sail on both sides , creating a force that sucks the sail towards where it 's billowing ... this force is going to keep on being there as long as the wind is flowing along the sail . It does n't matter how fast the boat is moving . This force is stronger when the wind is faster , and this force weakens when the wind is slower , but this force is not affected at all by how fast the boat is moving ! It 's the same amount of suction - force on a boat standing still , or on a boat slowly , or a boat moving fast . If the boat happens to be moving at a speed that happens to be higher than the speed of the wind ? So what ? There 's no relationship , per se , between the speed of the wind and the speed of the boat in that sense . The only relationship is that the speed of the wind determines how much suction - force acceleration is being applied to the boat . In theory , this could eventually accelerate the boat to \" infinite \" speed ( well , eventually relativity and speed of light limitations start to matter :) , as long as the wind kept flowing along the sides of the sail like that . It does n't , of course , because there 's drag on the boat . That is , resistance to its forward motion , mainly from the water , though somewhat from air too . For any specific amount of forward suction - force , there 's a maximum speed it can get the boat to , where the amount of force from water and air resistance is equal to amount of forward force from the sail 's suction , and the boat stops getting any faster . Obviously , the stronger the wind , the faster the boat can go before reaching that point , because the stronger the wind , the stronger the suction - force from the sail . But the point is , that maximum speed is * not * determined by a comparison of the boat 's speed and the wind 's speed . Rather , it 's determined by the relationship between the amount of suction - force you can get from that particular size & shape of sail at whatever the current speed of the wind is , vs. the amount of resistance on the boat ( determined by its mass and design ) . Of course skill matters too , because the boat wo n't actually get the true maximum force from the sail . How close it is to the maximum possible , depends on how well the sailors trim the sail to just the right point , and keep up with changes in wind direction , with a combination of subtly steering the boat and moving the sail in or out ."

      "Sailboats can go faster than the wind because they use the wind to propel themselves through the water. The wind pushes against the sails, which causes the boat to move forward. \nImagine you are holding a piece of paper in your hand and you blow on it. The paper will move in the direction that you are blowing. Now imagine you are holding a cardboard box in your hand and you blow on it. The box will not move as easily as the paper because it is much heavier and more difficult to push. \nSailboats work in a similar way. The wind pushes against the sails, but the boat is much heavier than the paper, so it doesn't move as easily. However, the shape of the sails is designed to catch the wind and use its energy to propel the boat forward. The keel, which is a long, heavy fin that extends from the bottom of the boat, helps to keep the boat upright and moving in a straight line. \nSo, to summarize, sailboats go faster than the wind because they use the wind to propel themselves through the water. The shape of the sails and the weight of the boat work together to harness the wind's energy and turn it into forward motion.",

    "generated_answer": [
      "When we miss someone we care about, it can feel like a physical ache or pain in our bodies. This is because our brains and bodies are closely connected, and intense emotional experiences can sometimes be translated into physical sensations. \nFor example, when we are feeling strong emotions like love, sadness, or longing, the brain releases certain chemicals that can affect our bodies. These chemicals can cause physical changes such as increased heart rate, tense muscles, and changes in blood pressure. \nIn the case of missing someone, these physical sensations can be a result of the brain and body reacting to the emotional pain of being separated from someone we care about. It's a natural response to feeling a sense of loss or longing for someone we love. \nIt's important to remember that these physical sensations are normal and will eventually go away as we adapt to the change in our lives. Taking care of ourselves, staying connected to others, and finding healthy ways to cope with our emotions can all help us to feel better and move through this difficult time.",

      "Professional athletes, especially those in popular sports like basketball, football, and baseball, have always been paid well. However, the salaries of professional athletes have increased significantly over the years due to a variety of factors. \nOne reason for the increase in salaries is the growth of the sports industry. As more people watch sports and attend games, the demand for professional athletes has increased, which has led to higher salaries. Additionally, television contracts and sponsorships have also contributed to the growth of the sports industry and the increase in athlete salaries. \nAnother reason for the high salaries of professional athletes is the competition among teams to sign the best players. Teams are willing to pay top dollar for the best players in order to improve their chances of winning games and championships. \nIt's also important to note that professional athletes have a limited window of time to make a career in their sport, as their careers are often shorter than those in other industries. This can also contribute to their desire to make as much money as possible while they are still able to compete at a high level. \nOverall, the high salaries of professional athletes can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the growth of the sports industry, competition among teams, and the limited career window for athletes.",

      "The celebration of Christmas on December 25th is based on the belief that Jesus Christ, the central figure of Christianity, was born on that day. However, there is no biblical evidence to suggest that Jesus was actually born on December 25th. In fact, it is likely that Jesus was born in the spring or summer, since shepherds in the region where Jesus was born would not have been tending their flocks at night in the colder winter months. \nSo why do we celebrate Christmas on December 25th then? The exact reason is not known for certain, but it is thought that the early Christian church chose this date in order to Christianize an existing pagan holiday that was also celebrated around this time of year. The pagan holiday, called Saturnalia, was a celebration of the winter solstice and the god Saturn. By setting the celebration of Jesus' birth on December 25th, the early Christian church was able to incorporate elements of this existing holiday into the celebration of Christmas, which helped to spread the message of Christianity to a wider audience. \nI hope this helps to explain why we celebrate Christmas on December 25th, even though it is unlikely that this is the actual day that Jesus was born.",

    "question": "The logic behind raising taxes for the poor and cutting them for the rich ? Thanks for the answers ! It makes a lot more sense now . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "The logic , albeit flawed , is that the \" poor \" ( who generally work for the \" rich \" ) do n't pay their fair share ( to an extent this is true ) , and that reducing taxes on the rich encourages them to invest it into things that create jobs for the poor . The idea is that by making the rich richer , wealth will \" trickle down \" to the poor . Hence the phrase \" trickle down economics . \" This has been shown to not actually work in real life . The only reason the rich are rich is because the poor ( the vast majority of the population , and therefore the vast majority of customers ) have money to spend on things that the rich make and sell . Further , when you consider that the poor SPEND most of their income , and the rich either hoard or invest it , it makes sense to use higher taxes to lift the tax burden off the poor so the economy can keep running . It also makes sense to use taxes to encourage the rich to invest their money into companies that build things and employ people instead of investing it into things that turn money into more money for no real work ( buying real estate , stocks , bonds ) , or worse , hoarding it in trust funds and offshore bank accounts ( often to avoid paying taxes on it ) . Yes , the richest people often pay more in taxes than the poor make in a year . BUT , when you consider that the rich are only rich because of the infrastructure that our tax dollars built it 's only fair that they pay a larger share . If there was no public education system , you would n't have any skilled workers to make your money with . If there were no roads you would n't be able to ship your goods far enough to become as rich as you are . In the end , the rich will end up paying a smaller portion ( if not a smaller amount ) of their income in taxes because of tax loopholes ( ie , because the capital gains tax is a lower percentage than income tax , and much of their income is from investments ) and because they spend less of their income , meaning less of their income goes to sales taxes and excise taxes . This is why Monaco , despite having an 18 % tax rate , is considered a tax haven . The poor end up paying a vastly higher effective tax rate ( assuming they spend 60 % of their income , they would be paying 10.8 % in taxes ) than the rich ( who , assuming they spend 10 % of the income , would be paying 1.8 % in tax ) . I use the terms poor and rich very loosely , of course .",
      "Taxes are not meant to be used as a tool of social engineering , or wielded to punish specific social class or group .

Note that tax rates increase sharply at relatively low levels of income . A family of two doctors could easily earn 250 - 350k / year . In order to become a doctor you have to spend 10 + years in various schools and underpaid apprenticeship programs and incurred hundreds of thousands in student loans . Is there anything unfair about doctors earning that much , and should we punish them to restore fairness ? Some argue for a completely flat tax rate curve to simplify the process and remove distortionary influences . Do you know who lobbies against this - Intuit and the other tax preparation companies .

You can double , triple or quadruple taxes overall - they do n't care . It does n't affect them , cause they pay nothing to start with . It 's what economists call a Moral Hazard - you know whatever happens will cause someone else to pay the cost , not you . However , the answer we favor is not simply raise taxes on the poor and lower taxes on the rich . That by itself will not fix the fundamental problem . That problem is the insane complexity of the US tax system . It costs a lot of money to comply with the tax code - In many cases the costs of making sure you are in compliance outweigh the actual taxes paid , especially for businesses . Some of those costs include * Additional Record Keeping * Accountants * Lawyers * Lost Revenue , as your time and efforts could be spent on profitable activities instead of tax compliance * Economic Distortions - Tax loopholes and penalties give you an incentive to change your behaviors in ways that would not make business sense without them * Lobbying - If the tax system allows some groups to get preferential treatment , almost every business or interest group out there is going to lobby for them to get their own special treatment * Tax Evasion * Underground or Black Market Economy Simple tweaks of the rates here and there are not going to solve any of the major issues with the tax code - I want to see damn near everything we have wiped off the slate , and replaced with a much more straightforward tax plan . My personal preference would be something like the \" Fair Tax \" plan - Something that wipes out ALL income taxes , and replaces it with a across the board sales tax ( Along with a \" Prebate \" that would cover any sales taxes for a level up to the poverty level ) I 'm not necessarily married to that one specific proposal - but something of that nature that radically simplifies the current system , and puts millions of tax lawyers , lobbyists and accountants out of work while making it easier on the taxpayer would be good for me ."

      "There is no inherent logic behind raising taxes for the poor and cutting them for the rich. Different governments and policy makers have different reasons for choosing to implement certain tax policies. Here are a few examples of reasons that might be given for raising taxes on the poor and cutting them for the rich: \n1. Some people argue that the rich should pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes because they can afford to pay more. This is sometimes referred to as a \"progressive\" tax system. \n2. Some governments may raise taxes on the poor in order to fund programs or services that benefit the poor, such as social welfare programs. \n3. Some governments may cut taxes for the rich in order to encourage economic growth and investment. The theory is that if the rich have more money to spend or invest, it will create jobs and stimulate the economy. \nIt's important to note that these are just a few examples, and there are many different factors that can influence a government's tax policies.

      "When you roll down a car window slightly and drive down the road, the wind rushing past the window can create a loud, high-pitched sound.

Most well known being borrowing a lot of money from banks , several times what the total amount of money in the fund , as a way to amplify the strength of the investment money . But most hedge funds are secretive and do n't openly declare their strategies , to prevent competition . One of the key reasons why they are able to succeed with high returns is because they are unregulated , and can do crazy risky things that other funds ca n't .

      "Imagine a private mutual fund that hides their strategies for investment That 's a hedge fund , and they hide their strategies because the market is efficient and if they 've found a model that actually beats the market , that is a secret worth keeping",
      "A hedge fund is an investment fund that uses hedging instruments to seek outsized returns . Hedging instruments are instruments that can be used to lower your risk . For example , if you are a farmer and you know you will produce 100 gallons of milk per day for the next year , you can pre - sell that milk on a futures or forwards market , thereby reducing your risk . This is called hedging . On the other side of your hedge might be a cheese manufacturer who wants to guarantee their input costs and therefore also hedge using futures contracts . Unfortunately , the amount of people who need to hedge do n't perfectly balance out . In come the speculators . These speculators take the other side of the deal allowing the counter - party to hedge . What 's more , the speculator is seeking a return while the hedger is seeking a guarantee , so often the speculator demands a price that favours them , allowing them to earn outsized returns . In this example , if we expect milk to sell at $ 100 next year , the farmer might be happy to lock in a price of $ 98 , which would give the speculator an expected $ 2 gain . In reality , they might end up owing $ 10 if the price ends up at $ 88 , but on average , they trade a good return for the farmer 's security . What 's more , the Hedge fund does n't have to put much money down to buy this contract , since all they are doing is making a promise to pay in the future . Futures , forwards , options , and leverage ( borrowing ) are the typical tools Hedge Funds use to speculate on the market and get exaggerated returns . Hedge funds buy or sell these in combination with the underlying asset ( in this example , milk , but more commonly , stocks or index funds ) to exaggerate the moves in the market . If they correctly bet on an asset increasing in value , they can get more than 10x the market return of simply buying the asset . Conversely , they can also fail miserably . They are high risk and for this reason , you are n't supposed to invest in them unless you are an accredited investor . We tend to believe that they are extremely successful because of survivorship bias . For example , if you look at any hedge fund that exists today and you ask how much they made over the last ten years , almost all of them did extremely well . The reason of course is that the hedge funds that did badly over the recession no longer exist and wo n't be part of your database .

      "Great question! When you see a number like \"64GB\" on a USB drive or other storage device, it refers to the amount of data that can be stored on the device. But that number isn't exactly accurate because some of the space on the device is used for other things, like storing the files that the device needs to run properly. \nFor example, on a USB drive, some of the space is used to store the files that allow you to access and use the drive, such as the file system and drivers. On a console or computer, some of the space is used for the operating system and other programs that are needed to run the device. \nSo when you see a number like \"64GB\" on a storage device, it's an approximation of the amount of space you'll have available for your own files.

    "question": "Feeling depressed happens to everybody but at what point does depression become a mental illness Everyone gets sad sometimes , but where does the depression become a mental illness ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Feeling \" depressed \" as in sad is actually quite unlike what you experience during major depressive disorder . It 's just that the word has two commonly - used meanings that have some superficial similarities . When one happens , it 's normal ; when the other does , it is an illness . I have been sad . I have also suffered from clinically - diagnosed major depression . They are not very much alike .",
      "As a previous comment mentioned , quoting the DSMV : depression becomes classified as a mental illness when you identify with 5 of the criteria for a consistent and extended period of time . However , that 's not really an ELI5 answer , but in this TED talk ( URL_0 ) Andrew Solomon discusses depression in a way that I think anybody can relate to . In specific relation to this question , he says that Depression can not simply be described as \" sadness \" , but rather , \" much too much sadness , at far too slight a cause \" . He also brings up situations that sometimes get incorrectly labelled as \" depression \" . For instance , if a loved one passes away , and you feel deep sadness for several weeks , it may be hard to separate that feeling from the experience of depression , but if you can manage to function normally after a few weeks ( and by that I mean , you can get out of bed , you can take care of yourself , attend to your daily activities , not that you suddenly feel perfectly contented ) , then it 's likely a period of grief that you 're experiencing , and it will ultimately resolve itself . However , if you experience a loss and find yourself utterly in despair for months and can not manage to function at all then it 's more likely that the event triggered a depression and that you should seek treatment to resolve it , because it may not resolve itself normatively . I know this is n't exactly the most crystal clear difference , but the point is that the difference between sadness and depression is not necessarily the depth of the feeling . Some people find themselves very sad at times , but as a reaction to equally dismal experiences , but that is not mental illness . The label , \" Mental illness \" belongs to the inability for the mind to resolve the sadness , not the experience of the sadness itself .",
      "I 'm by no means an expert , but I would say when it no longer becomes logical . Everyone at some point in there lives goes through bouts of depression . The kind of depression that is brought about by an event that afflicts us . Clinical depression however can seem to have no particular reason . They are depressed just because . Everything in their lives might point to a happiness but it does n't matter ."

      "Everyone feels sad or down from time to time, and that's completely normal. However, when those feelings of sadness and hopelessness persist for a long time and interfere with a person's daily life, it might be a sign of depression, which is a mental illness. \nDepression is a medical condition that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. It can cause a person to feel very sad and lose interest in things that they used to enjoy. It can also cause physical symptoms such as changes in appetite, difficulty sleeping, and low energy. \nIf someone is experiencing these symptoms for a long time and they are causing problems in their daily life, such as difficulty going to work or school, not being able to take care of themselves, or having trouble maintaining relationships, it might be time to talk to a doctor or mental health professional.

      "The letter \"U\" and the letter \"V\" were originally used interchangeably in the Latin alphabet and were both used to represent the same sound, which is similar to the sound of the English letter \"w\". In fact, the letter \"U\" was originally just a variant of the letter \"V\" that was used at the beginning of a word. \nOver time, the two letters developed slightly different shapes, with \"U\" becoming more rounded and \"V\" becoming more pointed. However, the distinction between the two letters was not always consistent, and it was not until the Middle Ages that the modern shapes of the letters \"U\" and \"V\" became standardized. \nIn some older texts and inscriptions, you may still see the letter \"U\" being used in place of the letter \"V\" or vice versa. This is because the distinction between the two letters was not always consistently applied in the past, and the use of the letters varied depending on the time period and the language being written. \nSo, in the case of the American Museum of Natural History, it is likely that the use of the letter \"V\" in place of the letter \"U\" is simply a reflection of the conventions that were used when the building was constructed. The carvers may have used the letter \"V\" because that is how it was traditionally written, or because it was easier to carve the pointed shape of the letter \"V\" into stone.",

    "generated_answer": [
      "A hydrophobic treatment is a special coating that is applied to the surface of a ship to make it more water-resistant. This means that water will bead up and roll off the surface of the ship instead of sticking to it and soaking in. \nOne effect of using a hydrophobic treatment on a ship is that it can help to reduce drag and improve the ship's performance in the water. This is because water will not stick to the surface of the ship and create resistance, which can slow the ship down. \nThere are a few reasons why a ship might not use a hydrophobic treatment. One reason is cost: applying a hydrophobic treatment can be expensive, especially if the ship is very large. Another reason is that the treatment may wear off over time, so it would need to be reapplied regularly to maintain its effectiveness. Finally, some hydrophobic treatments may have negative effects on the environment, so they may not be allowed in certain areas.",

      "Correlation refers to a relationship between two things, where one thing (called a \"variable\") might have an effect on the other. For example, if you eat more ice cream, you might get more cavities. In this case, there is a correlation between eating ice cream and getting cavities, because one thing (eating ice cream) seems to be related to the other (getting cavities). \nCausation refers to a relationship where one thing (the cause) directly causes another thing (the effect). In the example of eating ice cream and getting cavities, the causation would be that eating ice cream directly causes you to get cavities. \nHowever, just because two things are correlated does not mean that one thing is causing the other. There might be other factors that are causing both things to happen. For example, if you eat more ice cream and also brush your teeth less often, you might get more cavities. In this case, the lack of tooth brushing is causing the cavities, not the ice cream. \nSo, to sum up: correlation means that two things seem to be related, but causation means that one thing directly causes the other.

But compare to the amount of money it would take to launch hundreds of expeditions over many decades , it 's not . With space exploration you get more bang for your buck .

In addition, the water in the oceans is very cold, dark, and pressure is very high at greater depths, which makes it difficult for humans and instruments to survive and work. \nOn the other hand, outer space is much easier to study because we can send telescopes and other instruments up into orbit or even beyond our own solar system to study the stars and other celestial objects.

    "question": "Freud 's Theory of Penis Envy . My friend suggested I check this out and it 's really hurting my head . Thank you thank you ! Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Copy - pasted from Wikipedia : Soon after the libidinal shift to the penis , the child develops her first sexual impulses towards her mother . The girl realizes that she is not physically equipped to have a heterosexual relationship with her mother , since she does not have a penis . She desires a penis , and the power that it represents . This is described as penis envy . She sees the solution as obtaining her father 's penis . She develops a sexual desire for her father . The girl blames her mother for her apparent castration ( what she sees as punishment by the mother for being attracted to the father ) assisting a shift in the focus of her sexual impulses from her mother to her father . Sexual desire for her father leads to the desire to replace and eliminate her mother . The girl identifies with her mother so that she might learn to mimic her , and thus replace her . The child anticipates that both aforementioned desires will incur punishment ( by the principle of lex talionis ) . The girl employs the defence mechanism of displacement to shift the object of her sexual desires from her father to men in general . TL;DR Freud did n't understand women . At all .",
      "Almost all of Freud 's theories have been disproven .",
      "Freud talked to a number of women with mental illnesses , and learned that many of them described being sexually abused by their fathers . He hypothesized that the sexual abuse was the cause of the mental illness . But if that were true , it must mean that truly shocking numbers of respectable Victorian men , people who were successful and respected members of the community , were routinely raping their daughters . And that obviously could n't be true ... right ? So he revised his ideas , and came up with the idea that girls desire their fathers ' penises ... and that 's why so many of his patients made up such awful stories about their poor innocent fathers ."

      "Sigmund Freud was a psychologist who developed many theories about the human mind and behavior. One of his theories was about how girls develop during childhood. According to Freud, girls go through a stage called \"penis envy\" during which they feel jealous of boys because boys have a penis and girls do not. \nFreud believed that this feeling of jealousy was a normal part of a girl's development and that it was caused by the realization that girls do not have the same physical anatomy as boys. He thought that this feeling of envy could lead to feelings of inadequacy and a desire to be more like boys. \nHowever, Freud's theory of penis envy has been widely criticized and is not widely accepted by modern psychologists. Many people believe that it is not accurate or fair to say that girls feel jealous of boys simply because they have a different anatomy. \nIt's important to keep in mind that Freud's theories are just one way of understanding human development and behavior, and that there are many other theories that have been developed since his time.",

      "Genetic makeup can make a person more or less susceptible to cancer. Some people may have a higher risk of developing certain types of cancer due to inherited genetic mutations, while others may have a lower risk. However, it is important to note that no one is completely immune to cancer. \nThere are several ways in which a person's genes can influence their risk of developing cancer. For example, some people may have inherited mutations in certain genes that increase their risk of developing certain types of cancer. For example, people with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation have a higher risk of developing breast, ovarian, and other types of cancer. \nIn addition to inherited genetic mutations, certain lifestyle factors can also increase a person's risk of developing cancer. These may include things like smoking, unhealthy diet, and lack of physical activity. It is important for everyone to take steps to reduce their risk of cancer by making healthy lifestyle choices and getting regular check-ups and screenings.",

    "question": "How is that scientists have n't been able to replicate the organ in fish that allows them to breathe underwater ? EDIT : Sorry to be confusing , I meant technologically , like to create a device that simulates it and would provide oxygen from water . Please explain like I'm five.",

If so , we have an easy answer . It 's called a [ snorkeling mask ] ( URL_0 ) . ;) ( completely tongue in cheek , this does n't actually do what you want ) . The real reason is because the oxygen concentration ( partial pressure ) in the water is much lower than the partial pressure of oxygen in the air . Therefore , it 's very difficult to concentrate it to levels that humans can safely breathe ( we need a lot more oxygen than fish do , just because we 're air adapted not water adapted ) . Getting any solute from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration is difficult . It can be done with something that binds oxygen very tightly , but then how to release the oxygen so it can be breathed in ? Also , getting the total pressure of the air correct so that it can be breathed properly would be difficult . There is even less nitrogen in the water than oxygen . Therefore , even if you could get enough oxygen it would be less than one atmosphere , maybe even less than one fifth of one atmosphere , in pressure , so it would be very difficult to breathe .",
      "The gills essentially have oxygen flow right into the bloodstream . this would be incredibly difficult to reproduce technologically as it would require direct access to the bloodstream while underwater as well and the chance that if a single leak appeared , you could very quickly die . However , what is more plausible is a machine which takes oxygen out of the water and we then breathe that . Some people have tried this in the triton , however it has many downsides , the largest is that ( even if it does work as claimed , I have n't seen proper tests ) [ it is almost physically impossible to extract air quick enough for an active organism like a mammal ] ( URL_0 ) ( why do whales and dolphins not develop gills ? ) . It is an interesting idea and I am sure it will be solved someday but for now , there are no obvious solutions to such a complex process .

    "generated_answer": [
      "It is actually quite difficult to replicate the organ that allows fish to breathe underwater because it is a complex system that involves many different parts working together. The organ that allows fish to breathe underwater is called the gills, and it is located on the side of the fish's head. The gills are made up of thin, delicate tissue that is filled with tiny blood vessels. When water passes over the gills, the thin tissue and blood vessels allow oxygen from the water to be absorbed into the fish's bloodstream. \nCreating a device that can simulate this process and provide oxygen from water would require a lot of technological advancements and a thorough understanding of how the fish's gills work. Scientists and engineers are constantly working on ways to develop new technologies and devices that can help humans breathe underwater, but it is a challenging task. For example, some researchers are developing special masks that use a process called \"rebreathing\" to recycle the air that a person exhales and convert it into oxygen that can be used again. These types of devices are still in the early stages of development and are not yet widely available.",

    "question": "Why can servers perform with ridiculous uptimes but desktops / laptops struggle sometimes if you leave them on too long ? Is it desktop OS vs server OS ? Or is it hardware ? * EDIT : This is in reference to mainly Windows OS 's Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "While server grade hardware is going to be more reliable , the bigger issue is the software you 're running . A typical server has the base OS installed , the application it 's serving ( if it 's not an OS - provided service ) and possibly some monitoring / logging software . When you buy a laptop , it comes from the factory with dozens of different programs installed & then you install dozens more applications .",
      "It can be some of both . But a lot will be hardware . Servers are designed so that many things can be replaced without having to take the entire server down . Hard drives and power supplies are a common example . Many servers have redundant power supplies that will let you replace one of them without taking the server down . Likewise , with hard drives in RAID arrays , you can replace a failed hard drive without interrupting the system . There 's a lot of extra cost involved to build a system like that , but it pays off in environments where downtime is very costly . Also , I do stupid shit on my desktop and laptop that I would never dream about doing on my servers .",
      "There are several factors to consider . 1 ) Service uptime does n't necessarily equate to server uptime . Server groups can be set up so that individual servers can be taken offline without interrupting the service as a whole . 2 ) Routine maintenance - a lot of services will have a regular maintenance period in which the servers are taken offline daily or weekly in order to fix any issues as the occur . 3 ) IT staffing - if a company is running a server of any significance will have either a contractor or employee available to fix problems with the server .

    "generated_answer": [
      "There are a few reasons why servers can often have longer uptimes than desktop computers: \n1. Hardware: servers are often built with higher-quality components and are designed to run continuously for long periods of time. They may also have features like redundant power supplies and hard drives to help ensure they stay up and running even if one component fails. \n2. Software: server operating systems are usually designed to be more stable and reliable than desktop operating systems. They may have features like automatic crash recovery and support for hot-swapping hardware, which can help prevent downtime. \n3. Usage: servers are often used for specific tasks, such as hosting websites or running databases, which means they are not being used for resource-intensive activities like gaming or video editing. This can help them run more reliably for longer periods of time. \n4. Maintenance: servers are often monitored and maintained more closely than desktop computers, which can help prevent issues from arising and ensure that they are running smoothly. \nIn general, servers are built to be more reliable and have longer uptimes than desktop computers because they are often used in critical applications where downtime can be costly.",

    "generated_answer": [
      "There are several ways that planes can be prevented from impersonating other airplanes and entering a country's airspace without proper authorization. Here are a few examples: \n1. Radar: Most countries have radar systems that can detect and track aircraft that are flying within their airspace. These systems can help identify the type of aircraft, its altitude, and its intended flight path. If an aircraft is behaving suspiciously or is not following the proper flight procedures, it can be detected and investigated. \n2. Air traffic control: Air traffic controllers are responsible for managing the flow of aircraft within a country's airspace. They communicate with pilots and provide them with instructions on where to fly and how to safely navigate around other aircraft. If an aircraft does not respond to their communications or appears to be behaving suspiciously, air traffic controllers can alert the appropriate authorities. \n3. Military aircraft: Many countries also have military aircraft that are specifically designed to patrol their airspace and protect against unauthorized intrusions. These aircraft can intercept and investigate any aircraft that appears to be behaving suspiciously. \n4. International agreements: There are also international agreements in place that outline the rules for aircraft entering another country's airspace. For example, if an aircraft wants to enter another country's airspace, it must first request permission and provide information about its intended flight path and the type of aircraft it is. If the request is not granted, the aircraft is not allowed to enter the airspace. \nOverall, there are many measures in place to prevent planes from impersonating other airplanes and entering a country's airspace without proper authorization.",

      "The extra body hair in the armpits and pubic region serves a few different purposes. \nIn the armpits, the hair helps to regulate body temperature by trapping a layer of air close to the skin. This trapped air helps to insulate the body and prevent heat loss. The armpits are also a common place for sweat glands, which produce a salty liquid called sweat. The hair in the armpits helps to keep the sweat close to the skin, where it can evaporate and help to cool the body down. \nThe hair in the pubic region serves a similar purpose, in that it helps to regulate body temperature by trapping a layer of air close to the skin. In addition, the hair in the pubic region helps to protect the sensitive skin in that area from rubbing and irritation, especially during physical activities such as running or biking. \nIn both the armpits and pubic region, the hair also serves to protect the skin from bacteria and other germs that may cause infections.

They may feel like they have no chance of winning a fight against their armed captors, and they may fear that any attempt to resist or escape could result in even more violence or harm. They may also be under the influence of drugs or other substances that could impair their ability to think clearly or make good decisions. \nAdditionally, it's important to remember that ISIS is a terrorist group that is known for using extreme violence and fear to control the people around them. They may have threatened the men in the videos with even worse consequences if they did not cooperate. \nIn general, it's not always easy to understand why people do or don't do certain things, especially when they are facing difficult or dangerous situations.

    "human_answer": [
      "Basically the faster you go the more power you need to go faster . As you get closer and closer to the speed of light that power gets closer and closer to infinity . This is true of anything that has mass , so anything with mass ca n't ever reach the speed of light . Massless particles ( including light ) are n't limited by this , so they run around at the fastest speed possible , which we call the speed of light .",
      "At low speeds * doubling your speed requires 4 times the energy . But as you get closer to the speed of light 4 times the energy is n't good enough . At some point 4 times the energy only gets you 1.9 times the speed . Then only 1.5 times the speed . Then only 1.1 . Eventually , very close to the speed of light you have to have 4 times the energy to go just 1 mph faster . You can keep multiplying the amount of energy by 4 put into going fast as many times as you want until you simply stop going appreciably faster . There is no amount of energy that you can put in to get past the speed of light because each mm / s closer you get to the speed of light takes more energy than humans have ever produced . The next one takes more energy than the sun will consume in it 's life time . The next one requires the death of a galaxy . * By low speeds I mean low compared to the speed of light , like a bullet train , or a sniper bullet , or the fastest a person has ever traveled or will travel in your light time .",

    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "The speed of light is a very special speed that nothing in the universe can surpass. This is because the faster something goes, the more energy it takes to keep it moving. Eventually, the amount of energy needed to keep an object moving becomes so great that it would take an infinite amount of energy to keep the object moving at the speed of light. \nImagine you are pushing a sled across the snow. The faster you want the sled to go, the harder you have to push. Now imagine that you are pushing the sled as hard as you possibly can, but it still isn't going as fast as you want it to. That's because there are other factors that are holding the sled back, like friction between the sled and the snow. \nNow imagine that you are trying to push a sled across the snow at the speed of light. It would take an infinite amount of energy to push the sled that fast because all of the forces that are holding the sled back would become infinite as well. \nSo, in short, we will never be able to travel at the speed of light because it would take an infinite amount of energy to do so.",

      "In an electrical circuit, positive and negative charges flow through wires to power devices like lights or appliances. The positive charge flows through the circuit to the negative charge, creating an electrical current. \nSometimes, circuits are set up with just a positive and negative wire, and these are called \"floating\" circuits. These types of circuits can be used in simple devices like a flashlight, where the positive and negative charges flow through the circuit and back again, turning on the light. \nHowever, in many cases, it is important to have a third wire in the circuit, called a \"ground\" wire. This ground wire provides a safe path for the electrical current to flow to the ground, or Earth, if there is a problem with the circuit. \nFor example, if a device has a short circuit or malfunction, the excess electricity may try to flow through the device and could potentially cause a fire or injury. By having a ground wire, the excess electricity can flow safely to the ground instead of flowing through the device or a person. \nGround wires are often used in circuits that have higher voltages, like those found in buildings or homes, because the risk of injury or damage is greater in these types of circuits.

      "In the United States, the government does not require everyone to have health insurance. However, the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare) did require most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty when they filed their taxes. The purpose of this requirement was to encourage people to get health insurance, so that they would be covered if they got sick or needed medical care. \nThe government does not require people to buy health insurance because it believes that having insurance is a personal responsibility. It is up to each individual to decide whether they want to purchase insurance or not. \nThere are several reasons why the government does not require everyone to have health insurance and instead relies on a system of private insurance companies to provide coverage. One reason is that private insurance companies can offer a wide range of insurance plans to meet the needs of different people. For example, some insurance plans cover more services than others, and some are more affordable than others. \nAnother reason is that the government believes that competition among private insurance companies can help keep prices down. When there are many insurance companies competing for customers, they may offer lower prices or better coverage in order to attract more business. \nFinally, the government does not require everyone to have health insurance because it is expensive to provide healthcare to everyone. Instead, the government provides financial assistance to help people who cannot afford to purchase insurance on their own. This assistance can come in the form of subsidies, which are discounts on the cost of insurance, or Medicaid, which is a program that provides free or low-cost healthcare to low-income individuals and families.",

NATO would gain a country with a direct border with Russia and increase their bufferzone between Russia and the west , while Russia wants to maintain it 's soviet buffer with Europe . For Russia it 's also a matter of prestige to keep allies from the Old Soviet block . Now , there is a theory that was presented by an ex - Putin cabinet member which says Putin is trying to destroy the east via this conflict as a way to start talks with Ukraine in which they 'd agree to receive aid from Russia to rebuild the east in exchange for their loyalty and staying out of the EU and NATO . Thus keeping them as allies . That 's if we only count countries in the scenario . If we count private entities then obviously whenever you have two sides selling weapons to both camps then the weapons companies are the ones who profit . EDIT : Also I 'm not sure why you 're saying ' NATO and Russia are clearly losing ' . This is a chess game and the only real loser is Ukraine which is taking the blunt of the conflict .",

Pretty much all NATO members ( except for the US ) were limiting their expenditures more and more year after year . The US was constantly trying to get other NATO - members to step up their involvement , but they all would keep declining . NATO was sliding into irrelevance . At the end , they were trying to position themselves as the protectors of the world from Iran ( for the lack of any other \" mission \" ) , but that was n't working out . They were still becoming less relevant with each passing day . And now , well , they are the saviors of the western world , once again . More relevant than ever . And since any entity fights for its existence above all other objectives ( which is just natural ) , it 's really safe to say that NATO ( as the organization ) is the greatest beneficiary of this whole situation . Russia is definitely losing . But Russia would be losing in either case . Years of problems / corruption / tensions compounding . No good exit strategy really exists . Europe is losing . Economically , this whole thing is really damaging . But it 's a matter of political principle . If they do n't step up , they 'll no longer be viewed as one super - entity . Instead , they would be de - facto divided back into separate countries . The only truly winning parties are US and China . For the US , it 's crucial to make sure Europe and Russia do n't get too comfy together , because then the dominance of the US would diminish . Which now , thanks to the Ukrainian situation , is no longer a possibility for another 10 - 20 - 30 years . US is still the only big dog in town for the foreseeable future , or at least until China steps up . And for China , Russia is now forced to deal with them on their terms . China can now dictate the terms of Russia 's \" turn to the east \" that was announced . Russia is backed into a corner , and China is the only alternative for Russia .

      "IIRC , the Baha'i faith holds that there is one true God , and that every \" prophet \" or founder of major world religions was a messenger of God providing an incomplete message , but one that would be understood by the people of that time . Krishna , the Buddha , Abraham , Jesus , and Muhammad were all revealing the True word of God , but God intentionally left the message incomplete . Sayyid Ali - Muhammad claimed that he knew the Mahdi was coming , and that he would be able to identify the Mahdi . The Mahdi is a messianic figure in twelve Shi'ite Islam who will bring a new age in which the world will be in union with the law of God . M\u00c3\u00adrz\u00c3\u00a1 Husayn ` Al\u00c3\u00ad N\u00c3\u00bar\u00c3\u00ad was the one who the Bab \" prophesied , \" he claimed to be the Mahdi . His teachings were written by his son , and Ali Nuri was proclaimed to be , all at once , the Mahdi ( messianic figure of Islam ) , the Matreiya ( messianic figure of Mahayana Buddhism ) , and the Messiah ( or Second coming of Christ ) . Basically , because all \" universal \" religions claimed that a Divinely Inspired figure would appear sometime in the future to bring forth a New Age , the Baha'u'llah ( Ali Nuri ) and the Bab asserted that this was proof that all religions were in part correct , and furthermore claimed that Ali Nuri possessed all of the qualities of this figure . According to Baha'i , the teachings recorded by Ali Nuri 's son encapsulate the complete teaching of the One True God . In other words , all of the other Holy Scriptures are incomplete revelations of the Word of God , while Ali Nuri 's teaching fill in the blanks and provide the full and complete Word of God .",
      "Interestingly most of the comments on this page are about the Baha'i attitude towards other religions , the Baha'i Faith has some interesting teachings in itself . [ This ] ( URL_0 ) is part of Baha'i scripture that explains the main principles . its not really EL15 , but its hard to put an entire religion in less than a page . If you do n't want to read it here are some quotes i cherry picked : * * \" Any religious belief which is not conformable with scientific proof and investigation is superstition , for true science is reason and reality , and religion is essentially reality and pure reason ; therefore , the two must correspond . \" * * * * \" He has declared that in the estimation of God there is no distinction of sex . The one whose heart is most pure , whose deeds and service in the Cause of God are greater and nobler , is most acceptable before the divine threshold \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whether male or female . In the vegetable and animal kingdoms sex exists in perfect equality and without distinction or invidious estimate . The animal , although inferior to man in intelligence and reason , recognizes sex equality . \" * * * * \" No individual should be denied or deprived of intellectual training , although each should receive according to capacity . None must be left in the grades of ignorance , for ignorance is a defect in the human world . \" * *",

    "question": "Winter and summer Can someone explain why when sun is closest to sun in orbit its winter on earth . When earth is away from sun its summer . Should nt electro - magnetic waves lose some of its energy as they travel ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Winter and Summer are n't caused by the earth moving towards and away from the sun . Earth 's orbit is elliptical , like all orbits , but it is n't eccentric enough to cause that kind of variation . The season 's are caused by Earth 's axial tilt , which is around 23 degrees . When the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun between June and September , it is exposed to more direct solar radiation and temperatures rise . From December to March , the northern hemisphere tilts away from the sun and temperatures fall . Since the southern hemisphere is on the opposite side of the earth , it experiences summer when the north experiences winter and vice - versa .",
      "Summer and Winter have nothing to do with the Earth 's distance from the sun . They are caused by the Earth 's tilted axis .",
      "The changes in distance from the sun are absolutely inconsequential from the perspective of energy from the sun . It is n't the distance from the sun that determines winter and summer . If it was , winter would be during the same time period worldwide , which it is n't . What determines whether it is winter or summer is the angle of the earth relative to the sun . The earth is tilted on its axis , which is the imaginary pole on which the earth rotates every day . The axis also spins , but much more slowly . Depending on whether the part of the earth on which you reside is tilted toward or away from the sun determines whether you experience summer or winter ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "Sure! The Earth's orbit around the sun is not a perfect circle, but rather an ellipse, or a slightly oval-shaped circle. This means that the Earth is slightly closer to the sun at certain times of the year and slightly farther away at other times. When the Earth is closest to the sun, it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere (where it is currently winter) and summer in the Southern Hemisphere. When the Earth is farther away from the sun, it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere. \nThe reason for this has to do with the tilt of the Earth's axis. The Earth's axis is an imaginary line that goes through the North and South Poles and around which the Earth rotates. The Earth's axis is tilted about 23.5 degrees relative to the plane of its orbit around the sun. This means that different parts of the Earth receive different amounts of sunlight throughout the year. \nDuring the winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole is tilted away from the sun, so the Northern Hemisphere receives less direct sunlight. This is why it is colder in the winter. During the summer in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole is tilted towards the sun, so the Northern Hemisphere receives more direct sunlight. This is why it is warmer in the summer. \nAs for the question about electromagnetic waves losing energy as they travel, electromagnetic waves do not lose energy as they travel through empty space. However, they can be absorbed or scattered by objects that they encounter, which can affect their intensity (how bright or strong they are). This is why the sun appears to be less bright in the winter than in the summer, even though it is actually the same distance away from the Earth.",

Both countries have historically had close relationships with North Korea, and they may see the country as a valuable partner in certain areas. By vetoing a UN resolution against North Korea, they might be trying to protect their own interests and maintain a good relationship with the country. \nAnother reason might be that they disagree with the specific actions proposed in the resolution. Even if they believe that North Korea's actions are problematic, they might not agree with the specific measures that are being proposed to address the issue. \nIt's also possible that they might have concerns about the broader implications of the resolution.

    "question": "Why do alcoholic drinks dehydrate you ? Why you get such bad hangovers due to dehydration from , beer , for example ? Surely the beer has water in it that contributes , like just plain water , to your bodies hydration levels ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "First , the body pays special attention to alcohol . It 's a small molecule and gets very quickly through the walls of the gut into the bloodstream and then to the brain . Second , if you weigh 60 kilograms , you generate about 60 milliliters of urine each hour . And for 80 kilograms , about 80 milliliters per hour , and so on . Third , we humans seem to prefer to drink our alcohol in 10 gram lumps . Ten grams of alcohol is about 12.5 milliliters ( but you can call it 10 mL and still be fairly accurate ) . So each glass of beer , wine , or spirits has about 10 grams of alcohol . Fourth , alcohol interferes with the mechanism that regulates the water levels in our body . So now , a little anatomy and physiology . In your brain is a small gland called the pituitary gland . It is divided into two sections : the front ; and the back . The back section is called the posterior pituitary . One of the hormones made by the posterior pituitary gland is called vasopressin , or anti - diuretic hormone ( ADH ) . Diuresis is a fancy word meaning urination . Now suppose that you are really dehydrated . So the volume of water in your body is low . But you still have just as many salts floating in this reduced volume of water . So these salts are now more concentrated in the reduced volume of water that you have when you are dehydrated . Your body has detectors that can sense both the saltiness of your water , and the volume of the water . If these detectors reckon that you are dehydrated , they send a signal to the posterior pituitary gland , which starts pumping out ADH . The job of ADH is to stop you urinating , so you hang on to your precious water . You reduce your normal rate of making urine . Alcohol does the opposite . It reduces how much ADH you make , so it increases how much urine you produce . Each shot of alcohol that you drink forces your kidneys to generate an extra 120 milliliters of urine on top of the normal 60\u00e2\u0080\u009380 milliliters per hour .",
      "Alcohol is a diuretic , i.e. it makes you pee . You end up peeing more than the water you get from drinking .",
      "There is a hormone in your body called vasopressin ( URL_0 ) . It 's purpose is to regulate how much water is in your system . When you are getting dehydrated , it releases and tells your body not to expel much water in your pee . That 's why your pee is darker when dehydrated ( less water ) . As it turns out , alcohol inhibits vasopressin so your body does n't know that you 're losing water via the many completely clear pees you take . Welp , the next morning when you 're sober and your body realizes how dehydrated you are , a lot of vasopressin is released and you have very dark pee ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "Alcoholic drinks can dehydrate you because they can increase the amount of urine your body produces. When you drink alcohol, your body is more likely to need to urinate, which can lead to a loss of fluids. Additionally, alcohol can interfere with the hormone that helps to regulate your body's hydration levels, which can contribute to dehydration. \nWhile it is true that beer does contain some water, it is also high in alcohol, which can contribute to dehydration. This is why it is important to drink plenty of water along with alcohol to help stay hydrated. \nHangovers can be caused by a number of factors, including dehydration, but they can also be caused by other factors such as inflammation, changes in brain chemistry, and the presence of toxins in the body. Dehydration can contribute to a hangover because it can cause symptoms like thirst, fatigue, and headache. \nTo help prevent hangovers and the dehydration that can come with them, it is a good idea to drink plenty of water while you are drinking alcohol, and to continue to drink water after you are finished drinking. It is also a good idea to pace yourself when you are drinking and to try to avoid drinking too much in a short period of time.",

    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "When a candle burns, it produces a small amount of smoke. This smoke is made up of tiny particles of unburned wax and other substances that are released into the air as the candle burns. \nHowever, when you blow out a candle, you are extinguishing the flame by cutting off the oxygen supply. This can cause the candle to smoke more heavily because the wax is still hot and the flame is still burning, but it is not getting enough oxygen to continue burning cleanly. The smoke you see when you blow out a candle is made up of these unburned particles of wax and other substances that are released into the air. \nOverall, the amount of smoke that a candle produces depends on how efficiently the candle is burning. A candle that is burning cleanly and efficiently will produce less smoke than a candle that is not burning as well.",

    "human_answer": [
      "I suppose at least theoretically they could , but the last few years have seen allergy rates in the western world shoot * up * . The main theories for this are due to lack of exposure to allergens at a young age , leading to an immune system that overreacts to every foreign body that it detects . Allergies are a side - effect of having the ( super complex but highly effective ) immune system that we do - this means that they are unlikely to go anywhere soon , because it would involve a fundamental change in the mechanisms of how we deal with pathogens .",

      "It 's not that genetics play no part but there is more too it than that . New allergies can be developed at any time ; for example career woodworkers who suddenly develop an allergy to sawdust ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "It is possible that allergies could eventually be phased out by evolution through natural selection, but it is not a straightforward process. \nAllergies are a type of immune system response to certain substances that are normally harmless to most people. The substances that can trigger an allergic reaction are called allergens. In some people, the immune system mistakes these allergens as harmful and mounts an excessive response to them. This can cause symptoms like sneezing, itchy eyes, and difficulty breathing. \nGenetics play a role in whether or not a person develops allergies. If a person has a family history of allergies, they are more likely to develop allergies themselves. However, genetics are not the only factor. Environmental factors, such as exposure to allergens and other substances, can also affect the development of allergies. \nNatural selection is the process by which certain traits become more or less common in a population over time. The traits that are most beneficial to survival and reproduction are more likely to be passed on to future generations. If a trait is harmful or disadvantageous, it is less likely to be passed on. \nIn theory, if a trait like allergies was consistently harmful and caused people to have a lower chance of surviving and reproducing, it could eventually be phased out through natural selection. However, this process can take a long time and is not guaranteed. \nThere is also the possibility that allergies could be beneficial to some people in certain situations. For example, allergies to certain substances could help protect against certain diseases or parasites. In these cases, the trait might not be selected against, and could even be passed on to future generations. \nSo, to answer your question, it is possible that allergies could eventually be phased out through natural selection, but it is not a simple process and is influenced by many factors.",

      "The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, is a law that was passed in 2010 that made significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. One of the main goals of the ACA was to make health insurance more accessible and affordable for people who didn't have it. The ACA did this by requiring most Americans to have health insurance, providing subsidies to help people pay for insurance, and requiring insurance companies to offer coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions. \nRecently, a group of states challenged the ACA in a case that went all the way to the Supreme Court. The states argued that the ACA was unconstitutional because Congress had passed a law in 2017 that eliminated a tax that was used to help fund the ACA. Without this tax, the states argued, the ACA was no longer constitutional. \nThe Supreme Court heard arguments in the case in November 2021, and a decision is expected sometime in 2022.

      "[ This gif will help . ] ( URL_0 ) Lighting . Lighting can change how a person looks . In normal day - to - day life , light sources , whether they be from the Sun or lightbulbs , are usually above you . When the light is here , the shadows appear in locations the brain is used to . Everything looks normal . But in a camera picture , the light is coming from the camera . This sideways approach actually ends up removing most shadows from the face , especially if the subject is directly facing the camera . The loss of shadows means a loss of details , which makes an uglier picture . This is why many selfies are taken from a downwards angle with the person 's head looking away , because it makes the flash come from a more natural angle . Take a look at how people always point a flashlight up at themselves from below when telling a spooky scary campfire story . It lights up the lower eyelid and eyebrow , leaving the actual eye socket dark . This makes a face look more like a skull , and subtly adds to the spookiness . There could be many more reasons as to why a picture looks ugly . Yellow lights / white lights . 2d image / 3d animated person .",
      "Mirrors reverse left and right so if you have a symmetrical face , you 'll look the same in mirrors and photos and in person . You see yourself backwards in the mirror and you 're used to that because you mostly see yourself that way . When you look at a picture of yourself , your left and right are reversed from the mirror image and the more asymetrical your face is , the more different you 'll look .",
      "Photos do n't show what we see in real life . They only show a representation of reality , kind of like a person making a painting , except more accurate . For one thing , photos are one - dimensional and real life is 3 - D. So some people can look uglier in photos than they do in real life , and others can look more attractive in photos than they do in real life ."

      "There are a few reasons why you might look different in a photo than you do in the mirror. One reason is that cameras and mirrors show us slightly different perspectives of our faces. When you look in a mirror, you see a reflection of yourself that is facing you, so you see both sides of your face at once. In a photo, the camera is usually further away from your face, so it captures a wider view of your face, including your profile. This can sometimes make your nose or other features look bigger or more prominent in a photo than they do in the mirror. \nAnother reason you might look different in a photo is because of the lighting. If the lighting in the room is different from the lighting in the photo, it can change the way your face looks. For example, if you take a photo in bright sunlight, it can create shadows on your face that aren't there when you look in the mirror. Similarly, if you take a photo with a flash, it can wash out your skin tone and make you look pale or shiny. \nFinally, it's also possible that you just see yourself differently in the mirror than you do in photos. Sometimes our brains can play tricks on us and we don't see ourselves as accurately as other people do. So even if you look the same in a photo as you do in the mirror, you might still feel like you look different. \nAs for why some people look different in photos than they do in person, it could be because of any of the reasons I mentioned above, or it could be because of other factors, like the angle of the camera or the expression on their face. It's also possible that you just perceive them differently in person than you do in photos.",

    "question": "How does turning on my WiFi enable better location accuracy ? Android apps like swarm , maps usually ask me to turn on WiFi , how does it locate my phone with a greater accuracy than cellular ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Because it can then triangulate your location using different wifi networks . Wifi networks tend to be more concentrated and numerous than cellular networks so it can get a more precise location .",
      "I wrote my final work at university about localisation with wireless networks . The problem with it is it sucks . You can talk it pretty and i did it a lot in my work because i wanted it to sound good and usable . But if you have any other possibility of localisation it is a lot better than triangulation with WiFi networks . But there is one important reason to use it , indoor navigation . As soon as you enter a building you will most likely lose your GPS signal and your great localisation ability . And Wifi is a great way to close this localization gap . And it is good enough to tell you in which room you are ( as long as you are in bigger rooms ) but errors of 5 meters or more are something that will happen a lot . The main problem with Wifi localization is that it 's usually done by checking the signal strength of the wifi network and it differs a lot , it depends on weather , humidity , materials used and even how many people are around . It 's really hard to make a model that takes all of those factors into consideration and is able to give a good localization result . In addition to that there 's the problem that modern routers usually have some kind of energy saving option that will disturb your measurements even more . There may be some exceptions to this , some museums / supermarkets have a very controlled area where weather / humidity and routers do n't change that often . This allows you to have a rather good localization indoors . Another possibility of improving your localization would be the pure mass of wifi networks , for example in a skyscraper filled with flats and wifi networks - the pure mass of information will give you a rather good position . And in both of those cases GPS is n't available or a viable option to rely on , which makes WiFi not only the best but the only way to locate your phone . Edit : and of course to use WiFi to locate your phone you need to have a database that tells you where all the different WiFi routers are . It may come from Google cars or a supermarket may provide the exact positions . For better advertisement or guided museum tours , where the WiFi is set up to be used as a localization tool . And i should mention that you can use special algorithems that fuse gps and wifi localization but if you compare the additional energy consumption you need to the improvement in your position it 's usually not worth it at all . Even though a small improvement can be achieved even when you use gps , basically a computer can guess how wrong both gps and wifi are and calculate some kind of average to get the best of both . But best of both is usually GPS .",
      "Your smart phone GPS ( using the term GPS loosely because it not always uses actual GPS ) determines your location in a myriad of different ways including but not limited to : data collected by Google street cars , Comcast WAPs ( you may have heard about how Comcast automatically turns on a second \" guest \" WiFi that is actually coming from your router ) , but I think the biggest contributing factor is our phones themselves constantly reporting which WiFi access points are in range . Simply put , as more data is collected things like location gets more accurate . Wireless Access Points nowadays also have additional antennas that are for polling the area and seeing who is passing in and out of their signals . They actually do some really incredible stuff called \" presence analytics \" where they log if you came in to range , connected , or simply passed through a WAP . I have a client who uses devices with this feature in stores in malls . You can , in real time or over a period of time , see how perhaps a sale at the store next door effects traffic coming in to your store . I kinda went off track , but this kind of stuff gets my nipples hard ."

      "Sure! When you turn on your WiFi, your phone is able to connect to nearby WiFi networks. These networks can be used to help determine your location. \nYour phone uses something called \"triangulation\" to figure out where you are. Triangulation is a way to find out where you are by measuring the distance between you and a few other things. In this case, the \"other things\" are WiFi networks. \nWhen your phone connects to a WiFi network, it can figure out how far away it is from that network. It does this by measuring how strong the signal is. The stronger the signal, the closer the WiFi network is. The weaker the signal, the farther away the WiFi network is. \nYour phone can connect to multiple WiFi networks at the same time. By measuring the strength of the signals from all of these networks, it can triangulate its position and figure out exactly where it is. This is much more accurate than just using the cellular network, which can only give a rough estimate of your location. \nSo, when an app asks you to turn on your WiFi, it's because it needs to use these nearby WiFi networks to help determine your location more accurately.",

    "generated_answer": [
      "Store-bought orange juice is made from freshly squeezed oranges, but the process of making it and packaging it for sale changes the way it looks and tastes. \nFirst, the oranges are squeezed to extract the juice. Then, the juice is pasteurized, which means it is heated to a high temperature to kill any bacteria or germs that might be in it. This helps to make the juice last longer and reduces the risk of food poisoning. \nAfter pasteurization, the orange juice is often stored in large tanks for a period of time before it is bottled or packaged for sale. This storage process can change the taste of the orange juice, as the flavors may become less vibrant and the juice may become less fresh-tasting. \nAdditionally, some store-bought orange juice is made from a blend of juices from different types of oranges, which can also change the taste. Some brands also add extra ingredients, like sweeteners or flavorings, which can alter the taste and appearance of the orange juice. \nOverall, the process of making and packaging store-bought orange juice can cause it to taste and look different than freshly squeezed orange juice.",

    "human_answer": [
      "Deals and discounts are usually done for two reasons . 1 . To get rid of any long standing inventory to free - up room for new orders 2 . In anticipation of high volumes of demand ( surge in amount of customers ) When demand is expected to be extremely high , companies can afford to mark down items and offer sales , the minimal loss in revenue from marking down products is in theory supposed to be easily made up by the added amount of revenue the company will receive from the increase in demand . Companies are n't usually only striving for one of the above reasons , Black Friday is inherently a combination of both . Stores experience large surges in the amount of shoppers , so they start off by marking down the prices on inventory which they are trying to get rid of first . Usually the items marked down in price the most are items which have been on the shelves for quite sometimes , or are items which are being replaced by newer models ( or seasonal ) . Deals similar to Black Friday are n't done other times during the year , due to the cyclical nature of retail shopping . It is much more difficult to sell products like televisions or other electronics during the year as compared with the holiday season . Some companies in fact lose a good amount of money maintaining their inventory during the year , only to regain all the lost revenue during the holiday season due to the increase in consumer demand .

      "Black Friday is a day when many retailers offer special sales and discounts to help kick off the holiday shopping season. It's called Black Friday because it's typically the day when retailers start to \"turn a profit,\" or go \"into the black,\" after being \"in the red\" (meaning they've been losing money) for most of the year. \nWhile it's true that Black Friday can be a very profitable day for retailers, there are a few reasons why they might not offer special deals and discounts more often than once a year: \n1. Limited supply: Many retailers have a limited supply of the items they are discounting on Black Friday. If they offered the same discounts more frequently, they might run out of stock or be unable to make a profit on the sale. \n2. Price sensitivity: People are more likely to buy something when it's on sale, so by offering discounts only once a year, retailers can create a sense of urgency and encourage people to shop on Black Friday. \n3. Competition: Black Friday has become a very competitive event, with retailers trying to outdo each other with bigger and better sales. If retailers offered discounts more frequently, it might not be as special or exciting for shoppers. \n4. Planning: Retailers plan their Black Friday sales well in advance and may have already purchased the items they will be discounting. If they offered discounts more frequently, they might not have enough time to plan and prepare. \nOverall, Black Friday is a way for retailers to drive traffic to their stores and websites, and generate a lot of revenue in a short period of time. However, it's just one part of their overall business strategy and they have to consider a variety of factors when deciding how and when to offer special deals and discounts.",

However , I took many a biology class in college , and 28 days is likely the amount of time to balance the energy required to ovulate and the best frequency for getting pregnant . For example , if women ovulated every week , that s a lot of menses and eggs and tissue . If they ovulated every 3 months , they 'd save energy but it takes a long time to get pregnant ( due to less episodes of a fertile egg ) and lose time to have babies . Of course , if the fertile period lasted longer , that would be ideal , but it did n't work out that way for us humans . Also , many animals have mating cycles based on the moon , likely because its an easy way to tell \" time \" , so it may be be a holdover from that . But I have no evidence , its just a theory .

    "human_answer": [
      "One other thing to note is how the upscaling fills in the new pixels that have been added to the signal . There are several ways of doing this . One great way to see how your device upscales is by giving it a black and white checkerboard signal : BWBWBW ... WBWBWB ... BWBWBW ... : : : : : : : : : : : My first example is what has already been mentioned by others : BW WB turns into : BBWW BBWW WWBB WWBB Another method of upscaling tries to fill in the new pixels with averages of the surrounding pixels , in order to make the image appear \" smoother \" . As you 'll see , this usually only works on signal containing scenes of real images , and does not work so well on abstract images such as a checkerboard signal . BW WB turns into : BGWG GGGG WGBG GGGG In that example , the top - left pixel retains its original value , while the three new pixels get the average of the surrounding original pixels ( Grey in this case ) . It is arguable whether this is better or not , but I try not to think about it too much or I 'll go crazy . Source : Digital Media Certified Engineer Edit : Formatting",
      "A few things to remember : Resolution is not increased . Detail is not added . The signal is in no way improved . The total information contained within the image is not increased , as there is no way to create new information where there is none for the missing pixels . Basically , a chip within the TV takes the 1080p signal , and divides a single pixel into 4 ( 2x2 , a bigger square essentially ) . Repeat for every pixel , and you 've taken a 1080p signal to 2160p . It takes what it knows , and essentially stretches it to fill the space it has .

      "When your 4K TV upscales a 1080p video to 4K, it is using a process called \"upsampling\" to increase the resolution of the video. Essentially, the TV is taking the original 1080p video and adding additional pixels to the image to make it appear as if it has a higher resolution. \nTo do this, the TV uses algorithms to guess what the additional pixels should look like based on the information in the original video. For example, if there is an object in the original video that is a solid color, the TV might use that information to fill in the additional pixels with the same color. If there is a gradient or pattern in the original video, the TV might use that information to create a smoother, more detailed gradient or pattern in the upscaled version. \nWhile upscaling can't actually increase the resolution of the original video, it can make the video look better on a 4K TV by adding more detail and making the image appear sharper. However, it's important to note that upscaled video will never look as good as native 4K video, as the additional pixels are just an approximation of what the higher resolution image should look like.",

    "question": "The War in Iraq . After reading all of the recent American Sniper reviews , I realized that I am really out of touch with what is going on in the middle east . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "9/11 happened . The people who did it were based in Afghanistan . So we went in there and started hunting them down . The administration of the USA , realizing that war was in vogue , said that Iraq has WMDs , and would make future terrorism against the USA possible so they had to take Iraq down a peg early . USA invades Iraq to get rid of the WMDs . It turns out Iraq had no WMDs * that posed a risk to the USA * . USA administration is embarassed at being caught in a bold - faced lie , or being tricked by bad intel . USA administration from that time and their political allies decide to reframe the war as a freedom fighting mission for Iraq . USA finds Saddaam Hussein , turns him over to the people who he dictated over for years , and the people hang him . USA puts in a government that they like and can be chummy with . Government says that democratic elections will be held . Elections put people into power that USA does not like . USA decides they need to stick around a bit longer and make sure everything moves smoothly to the new people in charge of Iraq . Throughout all of this , young men and women from around Iraq are fighting to get the American soldiers out of their homeland and to maintain their older way of life . Those people are labelled insurgents ( because soldiers can not be tortured ) . USA starts to realize that Iraq war had nothing to do with terrorism or nuclear weapons really and was started on bad intel or lies from administration . People who backed the war need something to make it look like the war was justified . \" American Sniper \" is made as a film to justify said war . Tl;Dr : George W. Bush started a war based on a lie or bad intel . Dick Cheney 's company made tons of money . Edit : made nukes into WMD and the bit in * stars *",
      "After the 9/11 attacks , everyone is on - board to kill whoever was responsible for the attacks . We invade Afghanistan in late 2001 . The initial invasion is an unprecedented success . American Special Forces and CIA operatives were able to align with the Northern Alliance to knock out the Taliban in a few months . The neoconservatives in government want to invade Iraq to pursue [ a vision of a new age of Pax Americana ] ( URL_1 ) . Iraq is located next to Iran and Syria . With Afghanistan invaded , the planners thought that we 'd \" bring freedom \" to the ME and surround Iran . America would own the most volatile areas of the ME , and would bring forced peace upon the region . At least , that was the plan . A pretext for war against Iraq was made . This was not a failure of intelligence , as most have believed . There was a deliberate effort to take advantage of the post-9/11 anger to invade Iraq . There was the [ Manning Memo ] ( URL_9 ) , which shows that George W. Bush planned to invade Iraq in March 2003 regardless of the U.N. inspectors , and more shockingly , GWB proposed sending a U-2 over Iraq to get shot down and provoke a war . The powers that be decided to claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction . They primarily accused Iraq of having chemical weapons . It is a known fact that Iraq was given chemical weapons by America to use against Iran during their war in the 1980s . However , the U.S. claimed that the Iraqis were making new chemical weapons . Moreover , the U.S. also claimed that Iraq tried to manufacture nuclear weapons . Colin Powell infamously got before the U.N. and testified that Iraq had centrifuge tubes used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons . [ It turns out later that the tubes were used to make conventional rockets ] ( URL_0 ) . Powell also claimed that Iraq had a biological weapons program based upon the testimony of an informant known as [ Curveball ] ( URL_6 ) . [ Curveball was later the target of a CIA burn notice as he was a liar ] ( URL_5 ) . Intelligence was also provided that Iraq tried to buy uranium ore from Niger . However , those [ documents were forgeries ] ( URL_4 ) . Nevertheless , President Bush uttered the infamous [ sixteen words ] ( URL_8 ) at the 2003 State of the Union Address claiming that Iraq had tried to obtain uranium . Joe Wilson , an American diplomat who claimed that this was a forgery , had his [ CIA - agent wife outed ] ( URL_7 ) . In any event , we were off to war . Eric Shinseki said that we needed \" hundreds of thousands \" of soldiers to invade Iraq and \" win the peace . \" Paul Wolfowitz and Donald Rumsfeld dismissed that notion . They were obsessed with a notion of violence of action wherein American technology would eliminate the fog of war , and allow the invasion of Iraq to success with as few was fifty thousand American soldiers . Under Rumsfeld 's aegis , we got rid of artillery to rely upon \" air artillery\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094sustained precision airstrikes were thought to be an adequate replacement for relatively slow - moving artillery . ( The U.S. later has a crash program to buy M777 artillery pieces because it turns out that artillery is still king . ) We invade Iraq . Modern maneuver warfare allows American armed forces to take over Iraq at unprecedented speed . We declare victory very quickly . However , there is no plan to win the peace . We have no idea how to secure the population . Wolfowitz & Co sent in Paul Bremer to run the country . Bremer decides to disband the Iraqi police force and military . He also decides to de - Baathify the government . Tens of thousands of newly - unemployed and disgruntled men with heavy weapons are left on the streets . The civilians quickly turn against America as we can not protect them from thugs . Foreign fighters with Iranian support flood to Iraq to fight against Americans , killing many civilians in the process . Suicide bombings and mass attacks are commonplace as we have Shiites and Sunnis trying to kill each other . Death squads are formed . Beheadings are commonplace . In 2007 , we turn a corner . Not only do we have the Surge of tens of thousands of American military men to double - down on a failing war , we also have the Iraqis revolting against foreign fighters . Significantly , Sunni rebels are sick and tired of foreign fighters slaughtering Iraqis , so the Sunnis join with American forces . There are also drones that wipe out hundreds , if not thousands , of insurgent fighters . General Petraeus and McChrystal change American strategy into counterinsurgency to win the hearts and minds of the Iraq people . Against all odds , the war in Iraq turns a corner . In 2008 , we enter in a [ status of forces agreement with Iraq ] ( URL_2 ) and we agreed to leave by 2011 . Obama takes over as President in 2009 , and happily pulls troops out accordingly . Everyone believes that Iraq can protect itself . It is left with lots of weapons and training . However , [ Iraq breaks out in a civil war ] ( URL_3 ) . The Shia are the majority population in Iraq , and the minority Sunnis , who had been the favored guys under Saddam Hussein ( who was Sunni ) , reject the Iraqi government . Sunnis attack Shias . Syria falls apart . Daesh gains power , and recruits many disgruntled Baath military leaders who were kicked out by Paul Bremer . TL;DR : American hubris leads to a decade - long misadventure in the Middle East .",
      "During World War 1 the british and the french took the middle east which was up to then governed by the Ottoman empire , They mapped and carved up the land by a treaty called Sykes Picot treaty , This treaty stipulated which areas of the captured middle east would become british or french colonies and also set which tribes would become the local rulers of each state . The idea was that by putting a minority ruling class in each country would make them dependent on their ex colonial power which would guarantee political influence and flow of cheap oil to europe . What they did nt count on is that at first in the post WW2 world the french and british position as colonial superpowers would decline and their position on the global stage would be taken over by the new superpowers such as the Soviet Union and the United States . Now you have to understand that Iraq has 3 major Ethnic and religious groups , Sunni , Shia and Kurd . Under the ottoman empire they were seperated in to 3 districts with their own local goverments , Mosul , Bagdad and Basra , and that most or less controlled etnic tensions between the 3 groups . The british unified it under 1 country called Iraq . cut off a small oil rich sunny wahabi part from the south and called it Kuwait , and then put a Hasemite based Royal family in power , They were overtrown in a series of coups which lasted until the Baath party with support of the US took over Iraq in 1968 , at first ruled by abdul but then taken over by one Saddam Hussain , Fast forward to 1980 , Iraq which is currently Sunni governed starts a long war against the fresh out of revolution shia Islamic republic of iran over fears that the new Islamic revolution would expand to the supressed Shia in Iraq . the war lasted for 7 years and left Iraq heavly in debt , the thing is that the US was selling weapons to both sides to keep things even since they thought that a single country controling so much of the middle east oil would be dangerous . After the war iraq was in heavy debt to its creditors and it needed to raise cash , so they decided to call to opec to raise the price of oil , Saudi and Kuwait rejected the idea , and in 1990 Iraq invaded kuwait as a response to the rejection to raise prices . a US lead coalition liberated Kuwait and put Iraq under economic sanctions to prevent another invasion and assure the supply of oil . The UN food for oil program was established to allow Iraq to buy civilian only purpose goods ( food , medicin , infrastructure components ) paying directly with oil shipments , This caused a sharp decrease in the price of oil under the clinton economy which powered the 1992 to 1999 economic boom , oil reached as cheap as $ 9 a barrel . Then Bush Jr reached power , The problem is that Bush and most of his friends are in the oil business ( especialy one evil vice president ) , and they knew that as long as iraq was under sanctions and contained oil will be cheap . in 2003 using fake evidence they Invaded Iraq and overtrew saddam hussain , Now remember the first part of this story about the 3 major etnic groups which disliked each other ? , under the ottomans they were seperated from each other , and under saddam they were suppressed enough not to cause problems , but now with no goverment , and tons of millitary infrastructure from the armed forces of a failed state , they could finaly express their dislike for each other and the \" us liberators \" as much as they can . TL;DR : the UK and France created a country out of several etnic groups that hate each other , then the US put them under a Dictator , the US then punished the Dictator when he rebelled against them , and in the end they killed him to raise the price of oil to make a profit for members and friends of a highly corrupt goverment ."

      "The war in Iraq was a conflict that took place in the Middle East between 2003 and 2011. It was fought between the United States and its allies, and Iraq, a country in the Middle East. \nThe conflict began in 2003, when the United States and its allies invaded Iraq, claiming that the Iraqi government led by Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and was a threat to international security. The U.S. and its allies also claimed that Saddam Hussein was a dictator who was mistreating and oppressing the Iraqi people. \nThe U.S. and its allies quickly defeated the Iraqi military, and Saddam Hussein was captured and later executed. However, the conflict did not end there. Insurgent groups, including some who opposed the U.S. presence in Iraq, began attacking American and coalition forces, as well as Iraqi civilians. The conflict continued for many years, with frequent bombings and attacks taking place. \nIn 2011, the U.S. withdrew the majority of its forces from Iraq, but the conflict has continued in the form of an ongoing insurgency and sporadic violence. The war in Iraq has had a significant impact on the Middle East and the rest of the world, and it remains a controversial and divisive issue.",

      "Roman numerals are a system of numbers that use letters to represent different values. The letters I, V, X, L, C, D, and M are used to represent the numbers 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000, respectively. \nIn the system of Roman numerals, the letter I is used to represent the number 1. The letter V is used to represent the number 5. When these two letters are used together, the letter I is placed before the letter V to represent the number 4. This is written as \"IV\". \nHowever, some wristwatches with Roman numerals use the letter IIII instead of IV to represent the number 4. This is a matter of preference, and it is up to you whether or not you find it bothersome. Some people think that using IIII looks more symmetrical and aesthetically pleasing than using IV, while others prefer the traditional way of writing 4 with Roman numerals.

    "question": "Why ca n't scars heal ? Explain like i 'm actually 5 years of age . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Scars are like when you have to sew together a hole in your teddy bear . Your skin is like the fabric . Once you cut it , you 're not able to put it back together perfectly . A scar is like the little bumpy sewing line . Now why do n't you go watch Spongebob , so mommy can finish her glass of silly juice ... sorry it 's getting too real . EDIT : I kind of skirted your question . They do n't heal after they are formed because once a tissue can not really change it 's function . Scar tissue does not have the same qualities as skin or muscle or whatever it \" should be \" and it ca n't become something it 's not . Your body is also not really capable of dissolving it later or replacing it , the scar just sits there . It does gain some flexibility over time and tends to change colour but it 's still scar tissue . EDIT : just for reference here 's a better explanation . Your tissues are designed to heal asap . There is no functional benefit to the skin taking it 's time to regrow and reconnect the tissue properly . This is the same basic idea behind blood clotting ; it 's a bad idea to simply wait until the blood vessels heal after they are cut , so rather than make it look pretty , a crappy clot just forms over the wound . With wound healing your body is just trying the patch the tissue ( eg . skin ) as a defence mechanism to protect against infection . A scar is basically just a mass of disorganized tissue held together by a bunch of collagen fibres . It forms quickly and \" good enough \" to cover the wound and hold the tissue together .",
      "You can try cold welding it in a 100 % vacuum ...",
      "Okay I 've never tried this & it 's been a while since my medical devices course but here 's a quick rundown . Basically you have two different mechanisms for healing 1 ) Scar Tissue ( This is what you are referring to ) 2 ) Regeneration ( This is what happens with tinier scars that can undergo mitosis ) Scar tissue basically happens when you damage part of the body that can not undergo mitosis ( mitosis is when your cells multiply , divide , and repeat to replace the damaged area ) and is unable to heal completely . Like if you imagine had a paper cut . It usually replaces itself over the course of a week and you may have some discoloration that will fade with time . Now imagine receiving a deeper cut , like cutting you hand with a knife , or bit by a squirrel ( verified ) . This damages a layer of the skin that was n't designed to regenerate because it can not undergo mitosis . As a result your body has to find a different way to repair the damage . Scar tissue is the bodies way to fix the damage by isolating the damage since the cells around ca n't repair the damaged area . This also means that if the damage is large enough and no cells are close by scar tissue can form . Even if the cells can regenerate . Let me try to think of an analogy Imagine grass right ? Let 's say that something happens and part of the grass ( Cells ) dies . Either 1 ) New grass will take root and start to grow where the old grass ( Mitosis ) was or 2 ) the dirt ( Extra cellular matrix or cells that under go meosis ) that sustains the grass will be washed away . So what grows in its place ? Another type of grass or weed ( This is glue in the wood block ) . TL : DR Body undergoes regeneration and replacement , scar tissue replaces cells that the body ca n't regenerate or grow back fast enough to prevent any further damage to the system . This was probably a horrible explanation . Sorry if it was n't clear ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "Scars are a natural part of the healing process when your skin is injured. When your skin is cut or damaged, your body works to repair the wound by making new skin cells. As the skin heals, a scar may form. Scars are different from the surrounding skin because they don't have the same amount of collagen, which is a protein that helps give skin its strength and elasticity. This is why scars are often flatter and smoother than the skin around them. \nSometimes, scars can be itchy or painful. This is because the scar tissue is still healing and your body is trying to adjust to the new tissue. But over time, the scar tissue will become less sensitive and blend in more with the rest of your skin. \nIt's important to take good care of your skin, especially if you have a cut or wound. Keep the area clean and use a bandage to protect it. This can help prevent infection and speed up the healing process.",

      "Not how it works . The processes ? To generate oil you need the organic material ( not dino bones ) to be at the right temp / pressure and lots of time .

      "Petroleum does n't come from bones . It 's mostly ancient algae ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "Sure! Let's start with dinosaur bones. When a dinosaur dies, its bones are usually covered in dirt or sediment. This helps to protect the bones from being damaged by the environment, such as wind, rain, and sunlight. Over time, the sediment around the bones can harden into rock, and the bones can become fossilized. This means that the bones are preserved and can remain mostly unchanged for millions of years. \nNow, let's talk about petroleum. Petroleum is a type of fossil fuel that is formed from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. When these plants and animals died, they were buried in sediment, just like dinosaur bones. However, instead of turning into fossils, the organic matter in the sediment underwent a series of chemical reactions over time. These reactions transformed the organic matter into a thick, black liquid called crude oil. Crude oil is the raw material used to make gasoline, diesel, and other products. \nSo, in summary, dinosaur bones can become fossils if they are buried in sediment and protected from the environment. Petroleum is formed from the remains of plants and animals that are buried in sediment and undergo chemical reactions over time.",

      "Lips serve many important functions. One of their main functions is to help us speak and communicate with others. The shape and movement of our lips play a big role in forming the sounds that make up words. Lips also help us to eat and drink by sealing off the mouth and directing food and liquid into the mouth. \nLips are also important for protecting the teeth and mouth. They help to keep out dirt and germs and keep moisture inside the mouth, which helps to keep the teeth and gums healthy. \nLips are different from other parts of the body because they have a special structure that allows them to be flexible and move in different ways. They also contain a lot of blood vessels, which gives them their reddish color. The skin on the lips is also thinner and more delicate than the skin on other parts of the body, which is why they can be more sensitive to touch and temperature. \nOverall, lips play a crucial role in helping us to communicate, eat, and protect our teeth and mouth.",

With alcohol and benzos , that chemical imbalance can be serious enough to kill you . Edit ; as others have corrected me , I figured I 'd add this for clarity . My post is mostly right , but backwards . The brain does n't stop making chemicals . It makes way too much , and the alcohol stops the chemicals from working as much . So when you stop drinking , the brain is still making a ton of stuff , but it 's all working now instead of being blocked by the alcohol . Sorry for the mix up . My source is a class I took in college a few years ago , and I remembered the gist of it without the details . Thanks again for the corrections ! Also , as a word of warning , this shit is serious . When you read that you can die from alcohol or benzo withdrawal , that means YOU CAN DIE .

      "Because it 's legal , we forget that alcohol is really a pretty powerful drug . It affects countless systems and processes throughout the body and has many interactions with other drugs . Neurologically , alcohol acts as a ' depressant , ' meaning that it causes an overall reduction in brain activity . Overtime , you brain can get used to this effect and stop producing natural chemicals that work to depress brain activity . This is physical addiction . When someone strongly physically addicted to alcohol abruptly stops , nothing is there to counter the brain 's normal excitability , since it has stopped making depressants due to the chronic presence of alcohol . This excitability can continue uncontrolled and is responsible for many of the symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal , such as seizures , which ultimately may lead to the alcoholic 's death . You can avoid the serious withdrawal symptoms by slowly tapering off the amount you drink .",
      "ELI5 answer : Alcohol is a depressant and affects the brain by decreasing brain activity . With extended alcohol use , the brain tries to balance this effect by increasing its own excitatory activity . When alcohol use is abruptly stopped , the brain can not adjust quickly enough and that leads to withdrawal due to hyperactivity of the brain . Physically , this typically starts with increased blood pressure , heart rate , and respiration later leading to confusion , delirium , and seizures , and can ultimately lead to death if not properly treated . People in withdrawal are treated by giving them alcohol or medications that act the same way ( benzodiazepines ) so that they can slowly be weaned off .

      "Alcohol withdrawal can be intense and potentially fatal because the body has become dependent on alcohol and needs it to function normally. When a person who has been drinking heavily stops drinking alcohol suddenly, their body can have a negative reaction because it is no longer receiving the substance it has become used to. This can cause the body to go into withdrawal, which can produce a range of symptoms such as tremors, seizures, and hallucinations. In severe cases, alcohol withdrawal can lead to delirium tremens, which is a condition that causes confusion, rapid heartbeat, and high fever. Delirium tremens can be life-threatening if left untreated. \nIt's important to note that alcohol withdrawal can be managed and treated safely by medical professionals. If you or someone you know is experiencing alcohol withdrawal, it's important to seek medical help immediately.",

    "question": "How is Canadian healthcare different from Obamacare ? Canadian healthcare , along with many other countries who provide healthcare via the government , is working perfectly fine , so how is it working when American healthcare is n't ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Canadian healthcare is , more or less , single - payer . Basically , you pay a tax to the government and the government insures you . American healthcare is a big old mess . We have single - payer for some people ( Medicare ) , full - on nationalized healthcare for some ( the Veterans ' administration , where doctors are government employees ) , private insurance for many , and no insurance ( fuck you and die ) for some . Obamacare is actually working -- it 's fixing some of the worst problems with private insurance and reducing the number of people with no insurance .

( There are certain things not covered , of course . ) Single - payer would never have passed in the US , so they compromised and used a partially privatised solution . Americans still use private insurance , but the government introduced subsidies to lower the cost of it , and enacted a large amount of reform , including mandating a minimum amount of coverage they have to offer , laws against different pricing based on sex or pre - existing conditions . There are a lot of similarities between the two- the ACA tried to take healthcare to a similar place , covering everyone , through market competition ( private hospitals and insurance companies ) plus subsidies rather than through a government monopoly on it . Now whether or not they 've succeeded ... Generally everyone on both sides is unhappy about it , but at least more people have some coverage in the mean time .",

      "Canadian healthcare, also known as \"Medicare,\" is a publicly funded healthcare system that provides universal coverage to all Canadian citizens and permanent residents. This means that all Canadian residents have access to a range of healthcare services, including hospital care, physician services, and prescription medications, at no direct cost to the patient. The healthcare system is funded through taxes paid by Canadians, and the services are provided by a combination of public and private hospitals and healthcare providers. \nObamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), is a healthcare reform law that was passed in the United States in 2010. It was designed to make healthcare more accessible and affordable for Americans by expanding coverage to more people and requiring insurance companies to offer certain minimum benefits. However, unlike in Canada, the United States does not have a universal healthcare system, and many Americans still do not have access to affordable healthcare. Instead, the ACA relies on a combination of private insurance companies and government-funded programs, such as Medicaid, to provide coverage to Americans. \nThere are a number of differences between the Canadian healthcare system and Obamacare. One of the main differences is that the Canadian system is universal, while the ACA only covers certain individuals. Another difference is that the Canadian system is funded through taxes, while the ACA relies on a combination of private insurance premiums and government funding. Finally, the Canadian system is administered by the government, while the ACA involves both private insurance companies and government programs.",

Macaroni was from the slang for the \" Macaroni club \" , not a real club but rather a term for when affluent young men went on the grand tour ( a world tour rich young men would do to become more cultural ) and came back obsessed with Italian high fashion and culture . Such men were then said to be part of the \" macaroni club \" , this owing to the fact that macaroni was a popular Italian food they would acquire a taste for whilst abroad . The song is not a revolutionary song but rather harks from the 7 year war with France where both British regulars and American militias fought together . The British held themselves in higher regard than most of the American bumpkins who often were n't professional soldiers and being of humble origins had little contact with European high culture . The British made up this song to wind up their allies in jest . Suggesting that this imaginary Yokel American fool had aspirations above his station , believing that he could jump on a pony stick a feather in his hat and suddenly he 'd be \" Macaroni \" , i.e. as fashionable as the wealthy youths who would be labelled as in the \" Macaroni club \" back home . It was n't until later during the revolutionary war that the Americans began appropriating the song for themselves , partially because its so catchy and the lyrics did n't really matter and partially to mock the British in a \" ha ha we do n't care about your jibes and we are proud of our hopeful naivet\u00c3\u00a9 \" kind of way ."

      "The Rosetta mission was a big deal because it was the first time that a spacecraft had landed on a comet. A comet is a small, icy body that orbits the sun. They are made up of dust and ice and are often called \"dirty snowballs.\" \nComets are interesting to scientists because they are thought to contain clues about the formation and early history of the solar system. The Rosetta spacecraft was launched in 2004 and it spent more than 10 years traveling through space before it reached the comet it was going to land on. \nLanding on a comet is different from landing on a planet like the moon or Mars because comets are much smaller and have a very weak gravity. This makes it difficult for a spacecraft to land on a comet and stay there. The Rosetta mission was able to land on the comet using a special landing module called the Philae lander. The Philae lander was able to anchor itself to the surface of the comet and take measurements and collect samples of the comet's surface. \nOverall, the Rosetta mission was a big deal because it allowed scientists to learn more about comets and the early history of the solar system.

      "X-rays are a type of electromagnetic radiation, similar to light or radio waves. They have a shorter wavelength and higher frequency than visible light and are not visible to the human eye. \nTo produce X-rays, a machine called an X-ray generator is used. The generator has an electron gun, which is a device that produces a stream of high-energy electrons. These electrons are accelerated through a tube inside the generator and are then directed towards a metal target, usually made of tungsten. \nAs the high-energy electrons collide with the metal target, they release energy in the form of X-rays. This process is called bremsstrahlung, which means \"braking radiation\" in German. The X-rays produced by the generator are then directed towards the part of the body being examined, and they pass through the body and are captured on film or a digital detector on the other side. \nX-rays are used in many medical and industrial applications because they can pass through most materials and produce images of the inside of objects.

Milk is a staple food that is consumed by people all around the world, while gasoline is mostly used for transportation and is not as essential for daily life. As a result, the price of milk is able to be higher than the price of gasoline. \nMilk prices in the United States are regulated by the government in order to help ensure that farmers are able to make a living and that the supply of milk remains stable.

This is often due to natural selection, where individuals with certain traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those traits down to their offspring. \nFor example, if a bird starts singing a new song and other birds find it attractive, they may be more likely to mate with that bird, and their offspring may also learn to sing the same song. Over time, the song may become more common within the population. \nThis process is not the same as what we typically think of as \"popularity\" in human society, where popularity is often based on personal qualities or social status rather than on the ability to survive and reproduce. However, it is similar in the sense that certain traits or behaviors can become more common within a group over time.",

      "Saving a Word file as a PDF is easy because PDF (Portable Document Format) is a file format that was designed to be read on any device, regardless of the software or hardware used to create it. When you save a Word file as a PDF, you're essentially taking the contents of the Word file and converting them into a format that can be easily read and shared by anyone, even if they don't have Word or any other word processing software installed on their computer. \nOn the other hand, converting a PDF back into a Word file can be more complex because a PDF doesn't contain the same kind of formatting and structure as a Word file. When you create a Word file, you can add things like headings, bullet points, tables, and other formatting elements that make it easy to organize and read the document. PDFs, on the other hand, are typically used for documents that are meant to be printed or shared as-is, rather than edited. So, when you try to convert a PDF back into a Word file, the software has to try to recreate all of those formatting elements and structure the document in a way that makes sense. This can be challenging, especially if the PDF contains a lot of complex formatting or images. \nThat's why there are specialized tools, like Adobe Acrobat, that are designed specifically for converting PDFs into other formats. These tools can often do a better job of preserving the formatting and structure of the original PDF when converting it into a Word file or other editable format. However, these tools can also be expensive, which is why there are also free online converters that you can use to try to convert PDFs into Word files or other formats. These free tools may not be as powerful or accurate as the paid ones, but they can still be useful if you just need to make a few quick edits to a PDF.",

    "generated_answer": [
      "Sure! Here is a breakdown of the differences between murder, assassination, and manslaughter: \nMurder: Murder is the most serious of these crimes. It is the unlawful killing of another person with intent, or malice. This means that the person who committed the murder planned to kill the victim or acted with the intention of causing serious harm. Murder is usually punishable by life in prison or the death penalty, depending on the laws of the jurisdiction. \nAssassination: Assassination is a specific type of murder that involves killing someone for political reasons, such as to advance a political cause or to gain power. It is often carried out secretly and can involve a conspiracy, or group of people working together, to plan and execute the murder. \nManslaughter: Manslaughter is a less serious crime than murder. It involves the unlawful killing of another person, but without the intention to kill. There are two main types of manslaughter: voluntary and involuntary. Voluntary manslaughter occurs when a person intentionally kills another person in the heat of the moment, often in response to some kind of provocation. Involuntary manslaughter occurs when a person unintentionally kills another person while engaging in reckless or negligent behavior. For example, if someone was driving while drunk and crashed their car, killing another person, they could be charged with involuntary manslaughter. Manslaughter is usually punishable by a prison sentence, but the length of the sentence will depend on the circumstances of the crime. \nI hope this helps!

      "There are a few ways that farmers can propagate seedless fruits. One method is through a process called \"grafting.\" This involves taking a piece of a mature fruit tree that is producing good fruit and attaching it to the root system of a young, healthy tree. The piece of the mature tree that is used is called a \"scion,\" and the young tree is called the \"rootstock.\" When the scion is grafted onto the rootstock, the rootstock provides the roots and base of the tree, while the scion provides the fruit-producing part of the tree. \nAnother way that farmers can propagate seedless fruits is through a process called \"cutting.\" This involves taking a cutting from a mature fruit tree and planting it in soil or water. The cutting will then begin to grow roots and eventually develop into a new tree. \nSeedless fruits can also be propagated through a process called \"layering.\" This involves bending a low-growing branch of a fruit tree down to the ground and covering it with soil.

The tissue is placed in a special nutrient solution and allowed to grow into a new plant. Once the plant is large enough, it can be transferred to soil and grown into a full-sized tree.",

      "Valves, also known as tubes, are used in guitar amplifiers because they can produce a warm, rich sound that is different from the sound produced by solid-state electronics. The way that tubes work is by using an electrical current to heat up a filament, which then produces a flow of electrons through a vacuum. This flow of electrons can be controlled using various components, such as resistors and capacitors, to shape the sound of the amplifier. \nWhile solid-state electronics have become more common in modern amplifiers, many musicians and audiophiles still prefer the sound of tubes because they feel that it is more natural and organic. Some people also enjoy the added complexity and maintenance required by tube amplifiers, as it gives them a chance to tinker with their gear and make it sound just the way they want it. \nOverall, the use of tubes in guitar amplifiers is a matter of personal preference, and whether or not they are used is largely dependent on the desired sound and feel of the amplifier.",

      "In the United Kingdom, the identities of some criminals, particularly those who were under the age of 18 at the time of their offense, are protected by law in order to prevent them from being subjected to vigilante justice or other harm. This means that their names and other identifying information may not be made public. \nIn the case of Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, they were both 10 years old when they were convicted of the murder of 2-year-old James Bulger in 1993. Because they were minors at the time of the crime, their identities were protected by law. This protection has been continued even after they were released from custody, in part because there have been concerns about their safety and the potential for them to be targeted by those who are angry or upset about the crime they committed. \nOverall, the decision to protect the identities of certain criminals is made in the interest of ensuring that they are able to receive a fair trial and to protect their safety once they have served their sentence.",

    "human_answer": [
      "Shock diamonds URL_0 Supersonic(faster than the speed of sound ) exhaust causes them to form . They can also be seen on supersonic jet engine exhaust plumes .",
      "These are [ shock diamonds ] ( URL_0 ) . Rocket engines are designed to operate in space , where there is no atmosphere , and so the pressure of the gases leaving the engine is lower than the surrounding air . The atmospheric pressure compresses the gases leaving the nozzle ; as this flow is supersonic it creates shock waves , which are made visible by ignition of unburnt fuel . [ This website ] ( URL_1 ) has a more complete explanation .",
      "The SSME 's nozzle runs [ over - expanded ] ( URL_4 ) at sea level , because it 's designed for maximum performance at high altitudes . This means that its exhaust pressure is less than ambient , and so there is an exchange of energy between pressure energy and kinetic energy at and downstream of the nozzle exit plane as the flow tries to sort itself out and achieve equilibrium . Because the flow is supersonic , this exchange takes place via [ shock waves ] ( URL_2 ) . This shock waves produce dramatic local variations in the density of the flow . As the exhaust flow goes through these shock waves , it slows down . This converts some of its kinetic energy into increased pressure energy , which helps it to achieve equilibrium with the atmosphere . However , because of the gas law ( PV = \u00cf\u0081RT ) , the rapid increase in pressure drives up the static temperature of the gas ( total temperature is approximately conserved ) . This means that the flow immediately downstream of the shock is both denser and hotter than the flow immediately upstream of the shock . This has a dramatic impact upon how bright it appears to be , because 1 . The amount of light emitted within a given volume of gas obviously depends upon the number of atoms or molecules within that volume , and is therefore proportional to density . 2 . The total radiative power is proportional to the [ fourth power ] ( URL_0 ) of the static temperature of the gas . 3 . The SSME 's exhaust is a mixture of steam and Hydrogen , which mostly emits [ spectral lines ] ( URL_3 ) rather than black body radiation . This means that there is a minimum activation energy to get anything to happen , and so a relatively small increase in the mean static specific energy of the flow may result in a sudden and dramatic increase in radiation . Because LH2 / LOX engines produce an exhaust which contains no carbon , the flame has a very low emissivity , and is mostly transparent ( most of the radiation is actually in the UV range ; the red / pink tint comes from excess hydrogen in the exhaust , which is there because Isp is maximized by running rich and thereby lowering the mean molecular mass of the flow ) . This means that the Mach disc shows up particularly well . You can get a better idea of just how over - expanded the flow is from [ this image of a test firing . ] ( URL_1 ) Incidentally , if you were wondering why the Delta IV has a much brighter exhaust despite also burning LH2 / LOX , the reason is that the [ RS-68 ] ( URL_5 ) uses an ablative nozzle to cut cost . As it ablates , it adds carbon to the exhaust , upping its emissivity , producing a brighter , more yellow , flame . * * tl;dr * * over - expansion of the exhaust produces shock waves , which dramatically change the local static specific enthalpy in some parts of the flow . The amount of light emitted per unit volume is a very strong function of the local static specific enthalpy . * edited to fix a typo *"

      "A cone, or plume, forms when a space shuttle engine starts up because of the way that the fuel is burned. When the fuel is ignited, it creates hot gases that expand rapidly and escape through the nozzle at the back of the engine. As the gases escape, they push against the surrounding air, creating a cone-shaped plume. \nThe shape of the plume is determined by a number of factors, including the shape of the nozzle, the temperature and pressure of the gases, and the properties of the surrounding air. The plume can also be influenced by the shape and size of the vehicle, as well as the position of the engine. \nOverall, the plume forms because of the basic laws of physics that govern how gases behave when they are heated and pressurized. It is an important part of the space shuttle's propulsion system, as it helps to provide the thrust that is needed to lift the vehicle off the ground and into space.",

      "Musicians and bands often use Persian rugs in their recording studios or on stage because they can help to absorb sound and reduce echoes.

      "Peeling hard-boiled eggs can sometimes be tricky because the egg white tends to stick to the eggshell. This can happen for a few different reasons. One reason is that the egg white is more likely to stick to the shell if the egg is older. As an egg gets older, the egg white tends to become more watery and less viscous, which makes it more likely to stick to the shell. Another reason is that the egg white may stick to the shell if the egg was not cooked properly. If the egg was not cooked long enough, the egg white may not have fully set, which can make it more difficult to peel the egg. Finally, the egg white may stick to the shell if the egg was not cooled properly after cooking. If the egg was not cooled quickly enough, the egg white may become more difficult to peel.",

This is because Muslims believe that such depictions could be used to offend or disrespect Muhammad, and that they could lead to idolatry, which is the worship of something other than God. For these reasons, many Muslims get upset if they see imagery of Muhammad being used in a way that they believe is disrespectful.",

    "human_answer": [
      "Tin and lead have low enough melting points to be smelted by a campfire . It is a pretty likely accident , putting a rock in a fire , getting weird metals , then looking for more rocks that did the same . Copper is too hot to smelt in a campfire , but came along about the same time as pottery kilns , so it probably was discovered the same way lead and tin were . From the idea of \" hotter fire = better metal \" emerges pretty naturally , allow silver , gold , and eventually iron smelting to be discovered .",
      "Certain metals like gold , small amounts of iron , etc . can be found in their natural form without smelting . As time went one our ancestors learned that other metals could be extracted from rocks by heating them . Not all metals require insane temperatures to smelt either . Some of the early attempts could also have been accidental as hearth stones that contained ore were heated and we observed that metal came out of them .",
      "It might make more sense if you remember that pottery predates smelting in every society . Our ancestors would have already been able to create fires hotter than campfires with kilns , and would be familiar with the idea of using fire on raw materials to make useful tools . Also , as dancingwithcats says , certain metals , like copper , can be found in the ground in their native forms and could simply be picked out of the ground and hammered cold . Both of those things likely contributed to humans modifying kilns to extract metal and invent early metallurgy . And also , they did n't start out making 2000 degree furnaces ; they would probably have started out melting copper , then discovered that mixing it with other metals creates bronze , and then eventually made furnaces hot enough to extract iron and many other metals ."

      "The process of extracting metal from rocks, or ore, is called smelting. Humans have been smelting metals for thousands of years. \nTo extract metal from ore, we need to heat it up to a very high temperature. This is because the metal is mixed in with other elements and we need to separate it. To do this, we put the ore in a special furnace called a smelter. The smelter is like a really hot oven that can reach temperatures of over 2000 degrees Fahrenheit. \nWhen we heat the ore in the smelter, the metal becomes a liquid. This is because the heat makes the metal particles move faster and they start to break away from the other elements in the ore. The metal then flows to the bottom of the smelter and collects in a special container called a crucible. \nOnce the metal has cooled and solidified, we can take it out of the crucible and use it to make things like weapons and tools. \nIt's not exactly clear how humans first figured out this process, but it's likely that they learned through trial and error. They may have noticed that certain types of rocks produced a shiny, metallic substance when they were heated, and they experimented with different methods to extract and purify the metal.",

      "Swallowing does not rely on gravity . The muscles around your esophagus ( and all through your digestive tract ) contract in series to squeeze food through you . This motion is called \" peristalsis . \" As for getting the food in your mouth , that 's just a matter of getting a food that clumps together pretty well , directing it to your mouth , \" Here comes the airplane , \" and then nom .

      "Eating and drinking in space can be a bit different from how we do it on Earth. Because there is no gravity in space, food and drinks don't stay in one place like they do on Earth. This can make it a bit tricky to eat and drink, because the food and drinks can float around and be hard to hold onto. \nTo eat in space, astronauts use special utensils that are designed to be used in zero gravity. These utensils are often attached to the food packaging or to a tray so they don't float away. The food itself is also often packed in special containers that are easy to open and eat from in space. \nDrinking in space can be a bit trickier, because liquids tend to float around and can be hard to control. To drink in space, astronauts use special containers with straws or tubes that they can suck on to get the liquid to flow into their mouths. They also have to be careful not to drink too much at once, because the liquid could float out of their mouths and make a mess. \nOverall, eating and drinking in space requires some special tools and techniques, but it's not too different from how we do it on Earth. It just takes a little bit of practice to get used to it!",

    "question": "What 's the worst an identity thief could do if they somehow stole my social security number but nothing else ? I always hear this as a cautionary piece of advice regarding my internet habits but it seems dubious . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "I work in big data and identity theft protection , this is my field of expertise ! * * Assuming they only have the SSN * * A social security number by itself is useless . The only thing you can learn from a social security number is the year and location of issuance . This information can be gathered from the High Group List . If the SSN was issued after June 2011 , you ca n't use the HGL on it anymore ( the SSA started [ SSN randomization ] ( URL_5 ) ) . You can also check to see if the holder is deceased or not . This information used to be published monthly by the SSA : name , ssn , dob , dod , last known zipcode , and \" proof code \" . This was called the Death Master File ( DMF ) . The SSA used to publish this monthly in the name of fraud prevention ( they did n't want anyone using recently deceased information to take out loans and such ) . Last year they stopped publishing this information - again in the name of \" fraud prevention \" - because nobody was taking advantage of the DMF when issuing loans . The only people who ever used it were the criminals . Now they wait a year or two before publishing any of the deceased info . * * Assuming they have more than the SSN * * Data thieves work by following leads - just like a detective . If you have a name and SSN , you 're almost always able to get MORE information . Just follow the thread and employ a bit of social engineering . The easiest thing to do with your name and SSN is to e - file your taxes for you with bogus wages . I tell the IRS that I want a debit card with my refund on it and I get away with your tax return . * * You can prevent this by requesting a PIN from the IRS . * * Even if you do n't think you have been or will be targeted , get a PIN from the IRS . This prevents people from filing your taxes for you and getting a bogus refund . What else can I do with your name and SSN ? Well , I * probably * know where you live ( I can use the high group list and hope you never moved or I can do an internet search to find your online profiles - especially if you have a unique name ) . From there , I can likely find your address . There are TONS of people finding websites out there which use public \" consumer \" data . I 'll go into that more later . A perfect example is [ PeopleSmart ] ( URL_4 ) ( not the best data , but you get the idea ) . Again , this is PUBLIC DATA . All I have to do in order to get lots of info on you is pay for it . Most places will charge 10 - 50 bucks per report . What 's in a report ? Name , DOB , address history , phone numbers , relatives , criminal records , BLJ records ( bankruptcies , liens , and judgements ) , vehicle registration records , voter registration records , professional licenses , employment history ( though that 's getting harder to find these days ) , and the list goes on . Now I have everything I 'll ever need to destroy your life . I can have IDs made in your name - which is not hard for a criminal ( just head over to /r / fakeid ) . Or I can get REAL ids from the state agencies by pretending to be you . Lots of agencies will issue a new ID if you show them a bill with your name on it ( I 'll just stop by your house while you 're at work , steal a bill out of your mail , head to the DMV and claim to be you ) . So now I 've got all your information and valid ( or fake ) IDs in your name . What next ? Apply for credit cards , loans , and services in your name . I max them out and leave you to pay the bills . * * What are the best ways to prevent this ? * * - * * Get credit monitoring * * . Most banks offer this for a small monthly fee ( 5 - 10 bucks ) . It will not STOP someone from applying for credit in your name , but it will alert you when it does happen . If you can stop it before it goes too far , you 're likely to come out of this clean . If you let it go on for months , it 's a lot harder to prove that you 're the victim of ID fraud . - * * Get a filing PIN from the IRS * * . This prevents people from filing your taxes for you and getting a refund . It 's VERY easy to do - just google \" irs filing pin \" and you 'll be well on your way . If you forget your PIN , you just need to visit the local taxation office ( most states have a few of them ) . - * * Do n't opt - in . * * I mentioned \" consumer data \" earlier . Consumer data is data that 's collected from companies that you buy stuff from . Magazine subscriptions , online services , credit cards , loans , etc . Have you ever noticed that once you get a magazine subscription , suddenly you get tons of junk mail for other magazines ? Well , people buy this consumer data in bulk and look for people who recently bought magazines , put them in a mailing list , and dispatch the spam . Your profile consists of TONS of metrics . This includes your personal info ( name , address , phone , dob , etc ) , your property data ( own vs rent , house vs apartment , pool / no pool , central heating ? , number of fireplaces ? number of bedrooms ? etc ) , your hobbies and interests , the number of children you have ( and their ages ) , the number of pets you have , and just about anything else that you might learn about a person while taking a 101 language course . * * So what do you do ? * * Sign up for these services with fake information . Need to buy something online ? Use a prepaid debit card . And READ THE PRIVACY POLICY ! - * * Opt - out * * . Almost every website that sells consumer data will allow you to opt - out of their databases . If they do n't , send them a letter in the mail requesting an opt - out . If they ignore , get a lawyer to sign it . Most websites have an online form that lets you do this . [ Here 's a link to PeopleSmart 's ] ( URL_1 ) . The problem with this is that there are TONS of websites out there with your information . You could spend years doing it . Luckily there are a lot of services that will automate this process for you . Someone on reddit also made a link to the biggest ones and their opt - out forms : [ link ] ( URL_3 ) - * * Do n't give information that 's not necessary ! * * Lots of doctors offices , banks , and other places will ask for your SSN but they do n't actually NEED it . Leave it blank and only fill it in if they can explain to you why they need it . Legally , the only people who can * * require * * your SSN are the IRS . - * * Call The Big 3 * * ( TransUnion , Equifax , and Experian - and increasingly Lexis ) . They will NOT remove ID theft activity from your credit report unless you fight them . Eventually they will remove it ( especially if you have a lawyer ) but they 'll resist a LOT before they do . They 'll tell you that they 're just \" reporting what has been reported to them \" and \" our credit scores only reflect the data \" and other BS . Do n't give up ! The bigger the company , the more fuss they 'll make . - * * Get a police report ! * * Contact the FTC , attorney general , and SSA . The FTC will be one of your biggest allies throughout your battle , believe it or not . Most of them wo n't do crap without a police report , though - especially the SSA . After enough noise , the SSA will give you a new SSN , but you must prove that the SSN was actually USED . - * * Get your criminal records expunged ASAP * * Most courts offer this for free ( or a small fee ) if the record is over a certain age . Background check companies scrape county courthouse websites ALL THE TIME to gather these records . If your data is expunged , you can sue anyone who does not remove the record from their website ( though you have to give them a 2 week notice , usually ) . - * * Move out of Florida * * No joke , Florida sells EVERY bit of residential information they possibly can . They sell it all to data companies for extra revenue . Most states sell this information , but not all of it . Florida is the worst . Hunting licenses , fishing licenses , driving records , criminal records , voter registration records , all of it . - * * Do n't register to vote * * ( or if you do , URGE your congressmen to stop selling voter registration data ) . Voter registration data is sold in most states in bulk . It includes name , phone number , party affiliation , address , and DOB ( though a lot of them are now trying to only give the year of birth ) . Some states GIVE this information away for free . [ Ohio has a search feature for it ] ( URL_0 ) ( they used to just dump it all on an FTP for free ) . Most states make you fill out a form and pay a few hundred bucks for the data , though . * * Edit :* * If you have any other questions , * * please contact me * * . I really do n't mind answering questions about this . I honestly know more about the data end , but I 've been in this field for 5 years now and have learned a LOT through experience . I 'd be happy to explain more about how the data gets bought and sold from one company to the next ( that 's mostly what I do ) . * * Edit 2 :* * Just thought I 'd mention who 's who in this world of data selling .

Acxiom sells mostly online data ( they do customer tracking using IP addresses and cookies and then link it up to your real world profile for advertisers ) . InfoUSA sells demographic info for mailing lists . Looking for all the single mothers with 2 children and 3 dogs in zipcodes with less than 1000 residents ? That 's the kind of targeted mail - advertising InfoUSA offers . Though they do n't do the mailing themselves - they just sell the data . Background check companies are huge . There 's too many to count ! BeenVerified has decent data , URL_2 has subpar data , TLO ( now Transunion ) has excellent data , and I ca n't really speak for the others that much .

Binocular vision in hunting animals relies on the brain being able to estimate distance to prey . Having our eyes looking at two different things at once would kill our depth perception .",
      "Eyes come in two configurations for animals . Predator and prey . Prey have their eyes on the sides of their head for a very wide panoramic view of the world .

The problem with having such a wide view is that it is much more difficult to focus on any particular thing . This brings us to the eyes of a predator . When an animal is hunting , it needs to be able to focus in on its prey and chase it and catch it . Part of catching it is depth perception . With a wide field of vision it is harder to distinguish how far something is . It is very hard to catch something when you do n't know if it 's 5 feet in front of you or 15 feet in front of you . Since humans are wired for predator mode , our eyes and brains evolved to focus on things as opposed to giving us a panoramic view .

      "Processing power is part of it - computers now are able to optimize more data to minimize size in a given amount of time than they were 5 years ago . What this means is that an HD movie encoded to high - quality settings may have been possible in 2002 , but it would have taken months or years of raw encoding time . Today it could be done in hours , which is actually worth attempting . Another part ( at least with lossy algorithms ) is improvements in psychological factors - since we know we 'll need to drop _ some _ of the image data , we 're better at tricking the brain into not noticing that missing data ( for instance , by spreading the missing bits out over multiple frames in parts of the image that are relatively static ) .",

    "generated_answer": [
      "Developers make \"better\" compression algorithms by finding ways to compress data more efficiently. This means that they are able to reduce the size of the data while still maintaining the same quality. There are a few different ways that they can do this. \nOne way is by finding more efficient ways to represent the data. For example, instead of representing each pixel in an image as a separate piece of information, they might use patterns or colors to represent groups of pixels. This can help to reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored. \nAnother way is by finding more efficient ways to compress the data. This might involve using algorithms that are more efficient at finding patterns in the data, or using techniques like predictive coding to better estimate what data is most important to keep. \nFinally, developers can also make new codecs (compression algorithms for audio and video) better by improving the way that they handle different types of data. For example, they might create codecs that are better at compressing video with a lot of fast-moving action, or codecs that are better at compressing audio with a wide range of frequencies. \nOverall, the goal of compression algorithms is to reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored or transmitted, while still maintaining the quality of the original data.

In contrast, it would be much more difficult to cut a cube or a sphere out of metal using basic tools. \nAnother reason that round coins are so common is that they are easy to stack and store. If you have a pile of round coins, they will naturally fit together in a way that makes it easy to count them and keep track of how much money you have. Coins of other shapes might not stack as easily, which could make them more difficult to use. \nIn summary, round coins are common because they are easy to make, easy to transport, and easy to store. While it is possible that currency could be made in other shapes, round coins have become the standard due to their practicality and longstanding tradition.",

      "No, the baby will not look exactly like either of the twins because it will inherit a combination of traits from both of its parents. Identical twins come from a single fertilized egg that splits into two embryos, so they have the same genetic makeup. However, the baby will also inherit traits from its mother and father, which will contribute to its unique appearance. So while the baby may resemble one or both of the twins to some degree, it will not be an exact copy.",

      "It's not uncommon for dogs to spin around a few times before settling down to rest. Some dogs do this as a way to create a comfortable spot for themselves to lie down, while others may do it as a way to mark their territory or as a way to express excitement or joy. It's possible that your dog's spinning behavior is a combination of these factors, or it could be something else entirely. \nOne theory is that dogs spin around before lying down as a way to create a comfortable spot for themselves to rest. Dogs have a natural instinct to create a den or a safe place for themselves, and spinning around may be a way for them to do this. When a dog spins around, they may be creating a depression in the ground or flattening grass or other debris, which can make a more comfortable spot for them to lie down. \nAnother theory is that dogs spin around as a way to mark their territory. Dogs have scent glands in their paws, and when they spin around, they may be leaving their scent on the ground as a way to mark their territory. This behavior is especially common in male dogs, who may spin around as a way to show other dogs that the area is theirs. \nFinally, it's possible that your dog spins around as a way to express excitement or joy. Dogs are social animals, and they often show their happiness through physical behavior like spinning, wagging their tail, and jumping. If your dog is spinning around before lying down, it could be a sign that they are happy and content. \nOverall, the reason why dogs spin around before lying down is not fully understood, and it may vary from dog to dog. Some dogs do it more than others, and it could be due to a combination of different factors.",

    "question": "Why do people become outraged and upset at other people 's sexual preferences ? If nobody 's getting hurt or coerced , why do people get so bent out of shape about what other folks do in the bedroom ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "My theory is this : we humans have found the need to become self - controlled and disciplined for the good of our society . We keep our basic instincts in check so that we can focus on working together to build things and to make our lives better and free of danger . Obviously most of us like sex ... but we also do n't have sex anywhere , anytime we want . Society expects us to deal with our basic instincts in privacy . Those who can not do this are frowned upon because it shows a lack of self - control , a personality flaw that is seen as harmful to the well - being of our society . However , heterosexuality is more widely accepted ( or tolerated ) because it 's essential to life - that 's basically how you make babies . If you 're alive right now , chances are that your biological parents did the nasty at least once before . Homosexuality on the other hand is n't as widespread as heterosexuality so many people have trouble relating to it . They do n't understand its appeal . Because of that and because it does n't follow \" the norm \" , some people see homosexuality as a personality flaw , as the result of someone not being able to take control of their urges . It also does n't help that some gay people are extremely vocal about their sexual preference and may be attracted to heterosexual people , something which is n't reciprocated and can be the source of discomfort . In my opinion , the reason why some idiots are outraged about what gay people do in their own home is because they think their supposed \" lack of self - control \" is going to have a negative effect somewhere else in society .",

      "Standoffs are used to physically separate the motherboard from the case of a computer. This separation is important for a number of reasons. \nFirst, the motherboard and the case are made of different materials, and they can have different electrical charges. If the motherboard is in contact with the case, these charges can flow between the two, causing a short circuit. Standoffs help to prevent this by providing a physical barrier between the motherboard and the case. \nSecond, standoffs help to support the motherboard and keep it level within the case. This can help to prevent the motherboard from bending or warping due to the weight of the components that are attached to it. \nFinally, standoffs also help to provide airflow within the case by creating space between the motherboard and the case. This can help to keep the components on the motherboard cooler, which can help to extend their lifespan. \nIn short, standoffs are an important component of a computer case because they help to protect the motherboard from damage, support it, and improve airflow.",

    "question": "why English voice overs foreign films are comically atrocious Honestly I 've never seen a film with English dubs that has n't ruined the experience of not taking me out of the \" audience \" seat Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Because the US has a very different definition of ' voice actor ' than the rest of the world . In the US , from all that I read and hear on the subject , a ' voice actor ' is ' someone who can do a lot of voices ' . That 's the skill , and the requirement . There is no big voice acting / dubbing industry in the US ( and why would there be ) , so there are n't a lot of voice actors , especially if you eliminate the countless \" men with gravitas and gravel in their voice \" for commercials , infomercials and trailers . In countries with big and important dubbing industries such as Germany and Italy , a voice actor , more often than not , is someone with years and decades of theatre experience , or people professionally trained for the job . They usually only have one voice , their voice , and that is the product they 're selling , and their quality depends on their mood and tone variability , not on their voices variability .",
      "Anime is one of the greatest offenders in this category , so I 'll assume we 're talking about that for the sake of providing examples of the challenges . I 'm aware this applies across the board though as having spent some time in Germany recently I can confirm that the dubbing of English is equally dreadful there . * * Word play . * * Often in a plot arc , characters will give clues or other information about upcoming events ( foreshadowing ) through the use of very specific wording . \" I got rid of him \" vs \" I killed him \" . To an english speaker , we make the assumption that \" got rid of \" means killed . Different countries and societies may use a different euphamism entirely that is not applicable . For example , instead of saying \" I killed him \" they might ambiguously say \" He 's in the sack \" . Now we have to assume he really is dead , or he 's been put in a sack for some reason . But if they said \" I got rid of him \" it would be glaringly obvious . A bit of plot rewriting has to happen here . Alternatively , jokes or other forms of word play can be crucial to the plot , or at least just the joke of the moment , most of which can be lost in translation . The hard challenge here is if a joke ca n't translate literally , it has to be completely replaced . Translators exporting media might not be known for the same brilliant wit and humour as the source writers . * * National perceptions . * * If I was to tell you about a character who is a cold sociopath who 's presence gives you an uncomfortable feeling , what voice would you imagine he has ? Chances are many people in America would have similar preconceptions about the tone and mannerisms . Many Japanese on the other hand may describe it differently . The difficulty here is matching the voice with the appearance to create a well balanced character . If they use the Japanese description of the voice , it 's going to sound wrong in English no matter how skilled the voice actor is . * * Syllables and timing . * * It takes us 5 syllables and around 2 seconds to say \" I ate a biscuit \" . Some foreign languages it might take one second to say the same thing , others it could take five seconds if those words happen to be overly elaborate . To deal with this , the voice actor hastotalkreallyreallyfast , or possibly slow down a bit by maybe using some or lots of unnecessary words to kind of match the thing that they are saying with the movement that the lips are making . In extreme cases they might just rewrite the line to sound correct and maintain the original sentiment of what was said . Both of these can break a character 's linguistic consistency and snap you out of your willing suspension of disbelief if done wrong . * * Cultural perceptions . * * Different media may be adapted to fit different age groups , and different countries may have different standards for censorship . It 's common in Japanese anime for a well endowed female character to make an insulting remark about the size of a less endowed woman 's breasts . This is also acceptable if the characters are teenagers or children depending on the context . In some anime it 's a recurring theme ( Disgaea , for example . Etna is supposedly over 1000 years old , but she looks very young . ) Having characters that appear to be children talking about their breasts or other sexualized body parts can be a complete no - go area in some other cultures . In these situations the entire conversation may have to be thrown out and rewritten , or toned down . This can result in some awkward conversations that appear to just be filler with no substance behind them . Worse in situations where it 's a recurring joke , in that it may need to be replaced with another recurring joke that matches the characters body and face movements on screen but without any of the verbal content . Similarly , there may be visual changes to deal with . A naked character may be repainted in a scene to be wearing underwear . At which point a comment or joke about their nudity does n't amke sense , and has to be rewritten again . These are just some of the hurdles that need to be overcome when dubbing media for another country .",
      "A few possible reasons : * Difference in language styles . What comes off as smarmy in one language may not come off the same way in English . \" Matching \" those voice traits might make the character sound the same , but it might not make the character fell the same to an English - speaking audience . * Limited amount of voice actors . Voice dubbing is a skill , and it 's not one that every voice actor can do well . Because of this , many studios that do dubbing work with a limited amount of people because they know those voice actors can do the job well . * Budget . Some studios that dub movies / shows are doing it as cheaply as possible , especially if they think the project might not make a ton of money in the English - speaking world . In these cases , they often get what they pay for talent - wise . * Easier to identify issues . If an English - speaking character 's word choice is strange or does n't portray an issue quite right , it 's obvious to an English - speaking audience . The same audience ca n't quite pick up on the same issues in the original language . Because of this , it 's much harder for English speakers to identify a \" bad \" performance in another language than it is in English . * Audience expectations . Some people simply will not accept anything other than the original language 's voice actors as the \" right \" voices ."

      "There are a few reasons why English dubs of foreign films can sometimes be perceived as comically atrocious. One reason is that it can be difficult to match the lip movements of the actors in the original version of the film with the English dialogue. This can lead to situations where the characters' mouths are moving in a way that doesn't match up with the words being spoken in the English version, which can be distracting for viewers. \nAnother reason is that it can be challenging to find voice actors who are able to effectively convey the emotions and intentions of the characters in the original version of the film. This is especially true if the foreign film uses a lot of nonverbal communication, such as facial expressions and body language, to convey meaning. \nFinally, the quality of the English dub may also be affected by the translation of the original dialogue into English. It can be difficult to accurately convey the nuances and subtleties of the original language in another language, and this can lead to dialogue that feels awkward or unnatural. \nOverall, while there are certainly some well-done English dubs of foreign films out there, it is not uncommon for English dubs to be perceived as inferior to the original versions of the films.",

      "Predictive texting is a feature on some phones and other devices that tries to anticipate what word you are trying to type and suggests words that might fit. It does this by analyzing patterns in the words you have typed in the past and using those patterns to make suggestions for the current word. \nThere are a few reasons why your phone might be correcting \"hell\" to \"he'll\" but not correcting \"s\" to \"a\": \n1. The predictive texting algorithm may have learned that you frequently type \"he'll\" and therefore suggests it more often. \n2. \"He'll\" is a more common word than \"hell,\" so the algorithm might be more likely to suggest it because it is a more likely choice. \n3. The algorithm might be programmed to prioritize correcting common spelling mistakes over correcting less common ones. In this case, \"s\" instead of \"a\" might be considered a less common mistake, so the algorithm doesn't correct it as frequently. \nIt's important to note that predictive texting algorithms are not perfect and can sometimes make mistakes or suggest words that don't make sense.

The entire list is too long to post in one comment , so I 've put the titles here , but omitted the examples / explanations for the ones that are easier to understand . [ Here 's the link to her original full writing with examples for each reason here . ] ( URL_0 ) 1 . * * \" I do n't want to die . \" * * Her husband has told her that if she leaves he will kill her , and she believes this . ( She may well be right . ) The instant he gets a whiff of where she 's staying -- and he probably will , at some point , from a well - meaning friend or through the legal system or by persistent stalking or random chance -- he 's going to come there and he 's going to do something very , very bad to her . Staying with him may be horrible , but at least she gets to live . She believes that if she leaves , no one and nothing can protect her from his vengeance . 2 . * * \" I 'll die without her . \" * * He lives in his girlfriend 's apartment . He 's unemployed , or minimally employed , and has no education or good experience on his resume . He has no friends besides her . He 's gotten to the point where he does n't know how he 'll get food without her help , much less navigate all the challenges of life . And if he leaves her , he 'll be leaving everything -- she'll destroy any of his stuff that he leaves behind , stalk him so he ca n't stay at the same job , and even kill his pets . If he leaves her , he 's certain that he 'll end up living on the streets . 3 . * * \" He 'll die without me . \" * * 4 . * * \" What about the kids ? \" * * Right now , she protects the kids from her husband . He may rage at her , but she shelters them from the worst of it and she makes sure they have the best home she can give them under the circumstances . If she leaves , she doubts she can get sole custody of the kids without visitation , much less get it immediately . And if the kids are alone with him , something very bad will happen . He 'll hurt them , or turn them against her , or take them away and she 'll never see them again . Maybe all three . Her kids are her life and she ca n't bear to let something like that happen . 5 . * * \" I tried once , and it made things worse . \" * * This is n't the first time . He did call the cops on his husband before , and he ran away that night . The cops did n't find enough evidence , and when he came back to get his stuff , his husband was ... tearfully apologetic , actually . Somehow he talked him into staying and not taking his stuff . The punishment came later -- once he 'd more or less committed to staying around -- and it was horrible . But he 's afraid that if he tried to leave again , he 'd go through the same cycle again . 6 . * * \" I reached out once , and was rebuffed . \" * * In a rare moment of courage , he -- with shaking hands , summoning all his strength -- told someone he thought he could trust what his wife was doing to him . They told him to think about her point of view for once , to not use big drastic words like \" abuse , \" and to take care of his own damn problems without airing his dirty laundry . He just knows that if he reaches out again , it 's going to be the same thing . He 's lucky she did n't find out about that time and doubts if it 's worth taking the risk again . 7 . * * \" If I call the cops , I 'll be in trouble . \" * * She 's a prostitute . On the side , she sells drugs . She owns guns she should n't have and lives in a place she should n't be . Hell , she should n't even be in this country . Her lifestyle is so far outside the law that any attention from the police is likely to get her thrown in jail -- so she ca n't very well tell the police that her girlfriend beats her . 8 . * * \" Run away ? Call the cops ? I ca n't even get away with sneezing ! \" * * 9 . * * \" If it were so bad , someone would have done something . \" * * Everyone knows what 's going on in his life . His friends have seen his girlfriend hitting him ; his parents have heard him say \" I ca n't do that , she wo n't let me \" about a million things ; the neighbors have heard the screams and crashes when she explodes . He knows everyone knows already , and knows that they have n't done anything even though they know . So , he figures , what difference would it make to tell them ? Clearly they 've already decided that this is n't bad enough to call in the authorities over . 10 . * * \" It 's a joke to him , so it should be a joke to me . \" * * 11 . * * \" I 'm just terrified to hurt her feelings . \" * * Abuse has made her telepathic . Years of desperately trying to keep her girlfriend happy so bad things wo n't happen have made her keenly aware of her girlfriend 's every fleeting emotion . Her girlfriend is a tiny bit moody and she rushes to coddle and comfort her ; her girlfriend is a tiny bit happy and she just about throws a party for her . She 's so used to reading her girlfriend 's feelings and translating them into her own that she ca n't stand to do something that would really hurt her girlfriend 's feelings .

She 's a flowers - and - chocolates romantic , a believer in true love and love at first sight , and she treats her just like a princess . Except now and then , things get tense in the relationship , and bad things happen . Really bad things . Her wife just does n't seem like herself and she explodes . But the apology is even sweeter and lovinger than before and things are good again . Maybe it was a one - off . Or a two - off . A three - off ?

He 's trying desperately to treat her right , to treat her the way she deserves , and he just keeps fucking up . Often when she 's yelling he yells back -- sometimes he even hits back -- and that makes him more sure than ever that he 's the real abuser here . 19 . * * \" It 's not that bad . \" * * She firmly believes that real abuse is when they punch you -- and her husband 's only slapped her with an open hand . Real abuse is when they beat you -- and he only yells at her until she cries and then yells at her to stop crying . Real abuse is when they rape you -- and he always makes her say \" yes \" before he has sex with her , no matter how little she wants it .

      "It's not okay for anyone to be physically or emotionally abusive towards someone they are in a relationship with. Unfortunately, many people who experience abuse in their relationships stay with their abuser for a variety of reasons. Here are a few potential reasons why someone might stay in an abusive relationship: \n1. Fear: Some people stay in abusive relationships because they are afraid of what might happen if they leave. They might be afraid of retribution from their abuser, or they might be afraid of being alone and not having anyone to turn to for support. \n2. Love: Despite the abuse, some people might still love their partner and believe that they can change or that the abuse is a one-time occurrence. \n3. Lack of resources: Some people might feel like they don't have the financial or emotional resources to leave an abusive relationship. They might not have a place to go or the means to support themselves. \n4. Isolation: Abusers often try to isolate their victims from their friends and family, which can make it harder for the victim to leave. They might not have anyone to turn to for help or support. \n5. Hope: Some people might stay in an abusive relationship because they hope that things will get better. They might believe that their abuser will change or that the abuse was a one-time thing. \nIt's important to remember that no one deserves to be treated poorly or to be in an abusive relationship. If you or someone you know is experiencing abuse, it's important to reach out for help and support. There are resources available to help you leave an abusive relationship and to get the support you need to stay safe.",

The retirement age for both men and women is now 66, and it is set to increase to 67 in the near future. \nThis means that if a man gets a sex change and becomes a woman, they will be able to retire at the same age as any other woman. The same is true for a woman who gets a sex change and becomes a man.

      "The symbol for pounds (\u00c2\u00a3) or dollars ($) is called a currency symbol, and it is used to represent a specific type of money. The symbol is placed in front of the number to indicate the value of the amount being discussed.

For example, if you see the amount \u00c2\u00a310, you would say \"ten pounds.\" This is because we usually say numbers before other words, just like we say a person's name before their last name. \nSo, the reason we use the currency symbol before the number and say the number before the currency name is just a convention, or a way that we have agreed to do things.

They are distinct rank structures , but the question is really , \" What is the difference between Officer & Enlisted ? \" more than Commissioned ( Officer ) & NCO ( Enlisted ) . Enlisted in the US ( Army ) have paygrades of E-1 ( Private ) through E-9 ( Sergeant Major ) while Officers have paygrades of O-1 ( Lieutenant ) through O-11 ( 5 Star General ) . Commissioned Officers Begin at O-1 , however NCO 's begin at E-4 / E-5 ( Corporal / Sergeant ) depending on specialty , and service . The term ' Officer ' implies Leadership , or more specifically Supervisory or Managerial role of some type , even if it is just a general concept , such as ' leader of soldiers . ' A E-4 will generally be responsible for 4~ people ( a team ) , whereas a Lieutenant will be responsible for 30 - 40 ( a Platoon ) . However there is lots of other things that take place . Lieutenants are usually ' young ' ( college graduates , but still early - id 20s ) , so they are paired with experienced NCO 's E6 - 7s who are able to balance things out . This works out very well . This philosophy extends up the chain of command as well . There is a ' Senior enlisted adviser ' paired with almost every commander . Keep in mind that there is far fewer Commissioned officers than there are Enlisted ( the ratio is probably less than 20:1 overall , if not closer to 50:1 )",
      "An NCO is an enlisted person who joined at the bottom level , stayed in and gained practical experience in their field , and is in a position as a direct supervisor to the lower enlisted under them , running a particular squad , workshop , or office .

In terms of the civilian workforce , think of an NCO as being similar to a factory foreman or a store manager who makes sure things get done and run smoothly at the ground level , and an officer as a higher - level manager or executive who keeps the enterprise running across all angles . This is the widest and most broad - brush description possible , since the exact details can vary widely across services and particular job fields .",

      "When a venomous spider bites you, it injects a type of poison called venom into your body. The venom can cause different effects, depending on the type of spider and the amount of venom injected. Some venomous spider bites can cause only mild symptoms, while others can be very serious and even life-threatening. \nOne way that venom from a spider bite can kill you is by causing your blood pressure to drop very low, which can lead to shock and organ failure. This can happen if the venom causes your blood vessels to become dilated, or widened, so that your blood does not flow as strongly as it should. This can lead to a lack of oxygen getting to your organs and tissues, which can cause them to become damaged or stop working properly. \nAnother way that venom from a spider bite can kill you is by causing your body to have an allergic reaction to the venom. An allergic reaction is when your immune system overreacts to something it perceives as a threat, such as venom from a spider bite. This can cause a range of symptoms, including swelling, difficulty breathing, and shock. \nThere are many other ways that venom from a spider bite can affect your body and cause serious health problems, depending on the type of venom and the amount that was injected. It is important to seek medical attention right away if you think you have been bitten by a venomous spider, so that you can receive treatment to help prevent serious health problems or death.",

The institution requires that everyone getting a degree takes a minimum amount of these classes . They also require you have a minimum amount of credits completed . Each course is worth a certain amount of credits , and institutions handle them differently . My school requires you to have at least 120 credits for a degree ( I think ? ) , and at about 3 credits per course , this means I need to take about 40 courses before I can get a degree . Then you have your \" major \" requirements . This is the focus of your education , and consists of a sequence of courses and options within the discipline that you take during your time working towards a degree . Say you want to study astronomy - you 'll need to understand astrophysics for that . To understand astrophysics , you need to take physics . To understand physics , you need to understand calculus .

All of these different professions have slightly different paths to employment too : engineering and business degrees typically include internships ; low paying jobs you take during your final year or after graduation .

      "Sure! Here is a simple explanation of how college works in the United States: \n1. First, you have to decide what you want to study in college. This is called your \"major.\" There are many different majors to choose from, such as biology, engineering, business, or art. \n2. Next, you have to find a college or university that offers the major you want to study. There are many different colleges and universities to choose from, and they are located all over the country. Some are big and some are small, and they all have different programs and features. \n3. Once you have found a college or university that you like, you have to apply to go there. This involves filling out a form called the \"application,\" which asks for your personal information and your grades from high school. You might also have to write an essay and ask for letters of recommendation from your teachers or other people who know you. \n4. After you have applied to a college, you have to wait to see if you are accepted. This is called the \"admission\" process. The college will look at your application and decide if they think you will be a good fit for their school. If you are accepted, congratulations! You are going to college! \n5. Once you are accepted to a college, you have to pay for it. College is not free, and you have to pay for your classes, books, and other things. There are many ways to pay for college, such as scholarships, grants, and loans. \n6. After you have paid for college, you are ready to start! You will attend classes, do homework, and participate in activities. You will also meet new people and make new friends. \n7. After you have completed your studies and graduated from college, you will be ready to find a job. You can use the skills and knowledge you gained in college to get a job in your chosen field. \nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

      "The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, is a healthcare reform law that was passed in the United States in 2010. The main goal of the ACA was to make healthcare more affordable and accessible for Americans. \nHere are some ways that the ACA has been beneficial to Americans: \n1. Expanded coverage: The ACA expanded Medicaid (a government healthcare program for low-income individuals and families) to more people, and it also created new options for Americans to purchase private health insurance through Health Insurance Marketplaces. \n2. Reduced uninsured rate: Before the ACA, many Americans did not have health insurance because it was too expensive or because they were unable to get coverage due to pre-existing medical conditions. The ACA made it easier for people to get health insurance, and as a result, the uninsured rate in the United States has decreased significantly. \n3. Protections for people with pre-existing conditions: The ACA made it illegal for insurance companies to deny coverage or charge higher premiums to people because of pre-existing medical conditions. This has been especially beneficial for people who have chronic illnesses or disabilities. \n4. Cost savings: The ACA has also helped to reduce healthcare costs for many Americans by requiring insurance companies to cover certain preventive services (such as vaccines and screenings) at no extra cost to the patient. This helps to catch and treat medical problems before they become more serious and expensive to treat. \nOverall, the ACA has made it easier for Americans to get health insurance and has helped to improve the quality and affordability of healthcare in the United States.",

    "question": "What would happen if a syringe of water was injected into your veins ? Say you were prepping for surgery , what would happen if instead of anaesthetic , you were injected with water , in both small quantities and say a syringe full or more ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "If plain water were injected into a vein it would dilute the contents of the plasma ( mainly electrolytes like sodium and chloride , and proteins ) in that local area . Through a process called osmosis a portion of the water would fairly rapidly be drawn into nearby cells , in particular the red blood cells . Many of these cells would expand in volume rapidly to the point that their cell membranes would rupture , spilling their contents into the circulation . For a very small amount of water there would be no lasting harm . As the amount increases more red cells would be damaged . The harm from this falls into two categories - as you lose red blood cells , your blood is less able to carry oxygen to other parts of the body , and the substances leaking from the injured cells would in large enough quantities cause harm themselves since the balance of what is kept inside and outside of these cells is delicate and well regulated . If , instead of plain water , water with solutes in roughly the same concentration as the plasma was introduced ( such as \" normal saline \" ) , and the quantities were not ridiculous , then it would simply become part of your circulating blood volume . Over time the extra fluid would end up dividing between your circulating blood volume , the insides of various cells , and the fluid that surrounds cells in your body outside of the circulation . This scenario is common - for example , small volumes of saline are usually used to flush medications given through an intravenous line in order to make sure all of it enters the blood at the time it was intended to be given .",

      "If a syringe of water were injected into your veins, it would not be harmful in small quantities. However, injecting a large amount of water into your veins can be dangerous because it can cause your blood cells to become diluted.

      "I 've asked this question here before and have yet to find a suitable answer . Edit : Did google search . The following is courtesy of Mental_Floss . The most plausible one , espoused by a number of scientists who are n't this guy , is that the shiver is a result of two parts of the autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) getting their streams crossed . The ANS is a control system for involuntary muscles affects things like heart and respiration rates , digestion , body temperature control and urination . The ANS has two divisions . The sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) controls bladder function , among other things . It keeps the bladder relaxed and the urethral sphincter contracted so you do n't have to concentrate on not peeing your pants all day . The parasympathetic nervous system ( PNS ) relaxes the urethral sphincter and contracts the bladder when you decide to answer nature 's call . Part of the SNS response to a full bladder is the release of chemicals like catecholamines ( which include epinephrine , norepinephrine and dopamine ) . When you finally grab a minute to urinate , the PNS takes over , and catecholamine production changes . Some sources point at the change in chemical production as the cause of the shiver , and others say it 's the SNS to PNS switch itself that does it .",

    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "Pee shivers, also known as \"pee goosebumps\" or \"pee chills,\" are a sensation that some people experience when they urinate. They are caused by a reflex in the body called the \"micturition reflex,\" which is responsible for causing the muscles in the bladder to contract and release urine. \nWhen you start to urinate, your body sends a signal to your brain to relax the muscles in your bladder. At the same time, the muscles around your urethra (the tube that carries urine out of your body) contract to help control the flow of urine. As the urine flows out of your body, it may cause a feeling of coldness or wetness on your skin, which can trigger the micturition reflex. \nThe micturition reflex causes the muscles in your body to contract and release in a series of rapid, involuntary movements. This can cause the sensation of pee shivers, which may feel like a series of shivers or goosebumps. \nPee shivers are completely normal and are nothing to worry about. They may be more common in some people than others, and they can occur at any age. If you are experiencing pee shivers frequently or if they are causing you discomfort, you may want to talk to a healthcare provider for further evaluation.",

    "question": "Why did languages start to gender words , especially categorizing most objects as male or female ? This came up in a recent discussion amongst a few English professors , none satisfied with they could come up with . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "It 's not known , but there is some speculation . Essentially , the various grammatical markers that indicate grammatical gender may be ultimately derived from the language 's words for \" man \" and \" woman \" , or \" he \" and \" she \" , for example , originally only used for people , then all animals . This then became a way to categorize other nouns as well . Somtimes , the connection is not too hard to understand . For example , in ancient societies there were gods and goddesses associated with all sorts of things . The sun might be seen as having male qualities -- it 's strong at any rate -- and so to the Romans , Sol , the sun - deity , was clearly a male god , which is why , for example , the French word for \" the sun \" , \" le soleil \" , is masculine ; the moon , on the other hand , being much more gentle , was ruled by a goddess , Luna , hence the French word for \" the moon \" , \" la lune \" , which is feminine . Another way of assigning grammatical gender is by the form of the word itself . Once you have established a list of masculine words and a list of feminine words , you might notice that masculine words follow a certain pattern , while feminine words follow a different pattern . So you allocate new words a gender depending on whether they follow a typical \" masculine \" pattern or a typical \" feminine \" pattern . In Russian , for example , words ending in a consonant are usually masculine , words ending in \" -a \" or \" -ya \" are usually feminine , and words ending in \" -o \" are usually neuter . This explains the famous example of the German word for \" girl \" being neuter . The German word referred to is \" M\u00c3\u00a4dchen \" . This comes from the ( now old - fashioned ) word \" Magd \" , which is feminine and means \" maid \" . The \" -chen \" ending is what 's called a diminutive , and translates as \" little \" -- so \" M\u00c3\u00a4dchen \" means \" little maid \" , and is where we get our word \" maiden \" . But in German , all words with diminutive endings are automatically neuter , no matter what they refer to . By this stage , of course , grammatical gender is a completely different concept from actual gender or sex , and is really just a classification system and no longer an indication of whether something is male or female . English has now come full circle , and we use \" natural gender \" , meaning that women and female animals are feminine , men and male animals are masculine , and inanimate objects are neuter . There are some exceptions ; for example , ships are often referred to as \" she \" , probably because the crew depends on her to keep them alive and safe , but she can be difficult to control ( these are stereotypical female qualities , of course ) .",
      "We 're not really sure why . Human languages like to classify nouns : a lot of languages end up with some combination of masculine / feminine / neuter gender , but others have animate / inanimate gender , and there are a few languages that have over a dozen genders , loosely based on the \" shape \" of the object being referred to . We do n't know what the first languages look like , and we do n't know how gender first appeared . Our best methods for finding out what languages were like in the past only lets us go back 6,000 - 10,000 years at most . There have been examples of gender disappearing from a language ( eg , English , Persian ) , but I know of no languages that did not have gender and then obtained it , so there 's really nothing to go on for how it might enter a language .",
      "Nobody can give a definitive answer to that question , for the reasons that [ HannasAnarion points out in a comment ] ( URL_2 ) . With human languages we can only look back some 6,000 - 10,000 years in the past , but humans have been speaking at least 35,000 years . What I 'll say below is heavily based on [ my answer to a similar thread from some months ago ] ( URL_5 ) . One thing to keep in mind is that most familiar European languages like German , French and Spanish descend from languages that have gender as far back as we can trace them . The farthest we can trace them is to the [ Proto - Indo - European laguage ] ( URL_3 ) , the reconstructed common ancestor of German , French , Spanish , English , Greek , Russian , Hindi , Armenian , Farsi , Albanian , Kurdish , Lithuanian and a bunch of other languages . Linguists are not sure exactly when it was spoken , but hypotheses range from 6,000 to 12,000 years ago . But one thing we know for sure is that Proto - Indo - European had gender , and the German , French and Spanish gender systems are modifications of Proto - Indo - European gender . English is a bit odd among Indo - European languages for having lost its gender system \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and that happened less than 1,000 years ago . So the cheap answer to why German , French and Spanish have genders basically boils down to ( a ) they descend from a language that already had gender , ( b ) they have n't lost it in at least 6,000 years , ( c ) we just do n't know why Proto - Indo - European had gender , and in fact ( d ) we * ca n't * know because it 's prehistory . But there 's another way we can look at this question : by examining languages that * do n't * have grammatical gender , but have grammatical rules that are somewhat similar to it . One useful example is Japanese , which does n't have gender , but it does have one grammatical feature that 's very interesting in this context : [ noun classifiers ] ( URL_0 ) ( [ see also here ] ( URL_4 ) ) . Basically , in Japanese , any countable noun phrase requires the use of a * * count word * * or * * classifier * * , and which one is used depends highly on the noun . So you use a different count word depending on whether you 're counting sheep , cars , pencils , etc . At this point you should be struck by the similarity to grammatical gender . In fact , one of the theories about how gender systems develop in the histories of languages is that they start out as classifiers or something similar , and over time the words get \" smushed together \" and what was once a separate count word becomes a prefix or suffix to the noun . Linguists call this sort of process [ grammaticalization ] ( URL_1 ) . One familiar example ( though not about gender ) is that in English we have these three : 1 . I 'm going to let you finish . 2 . I 'm gon na let you finish . 3 . I 'm a let you finish . * I 'm going to X * , which started out with the literal meaning of moving from one place to another , is grammaticalizing into a future tense , and in the process it 's getting smushed together into * I 'm a * . So over thousands of years , you could picture Japanese going through a combination of changes like these : * A lot of the count words become archaic and eventually disappear from the language . ( This has already happened to a bunch of them ! ) * Count words start showing up redundantly on both adjectives and nouns in the same sentence . * The surviving classifiers get thoroughly smushed into the nouns and adjectives , and become prefixes or suffixes . And voil\u00c3\u00a0 , grammatical gender ! Disclaimer / clarification : the above is * one * theory of how * some * languages may have acquired grammatical gender . Either of these could be possible : ( a ) the theory is flat - out wrong , ( b ) the theory is true for * some * languages but not for others ( there may be more than one way that grammatical gender systems emerge ) ."

      "In many languages, including English, words for objects, animals, and other nouns are not inherently male or female. Instead, the gender of a noun is often assigned based on the gender of the person or being to which the noun refers. For example, the word \"girl\" refers to a female person, so in English, the word \"girl\" is considered a feminine noun. Similarly, the word \"boy\" refers to a male person, so it is considered a masculine noun in English. \nHowever, not all languages assign gender to nouns in this way. In some languages, the gender of a noun is based on the meaning of the word or its ending. For example, in Spanish, nouns that end in \"-o\" are usually masculine and nouns that end in \"-a\" are usually feminine. \nIt's not entirely clear why some languages have developed systems for assigning gender to nouns, but it is thought that the origins of gendered language may be related to the way that people think about and conceptualize the world around them. Some linguists believe that gendered language may have evolved as a way to categorize and organize the objects and beings in the world in a way that is easier for people to understand and communicate about. \nRegardless of its origins, gendered language is an important feature of many languages and is used in a variety of contexts, including grammar, vocabulary, and even social interactions. While it can be confusing for learners of a new language, understanding and using gendered language is an important part of speaking and writing in many languages around the world.",

    "generated_answer": [
      "The Hubble Space Telescope is a telescope that is launched into space and orbits around Earth. It has a special camera called a \"Wide Field Camera 3\" that takes very detailed pictures of objects in space, including the Milky Way galaxy. \nThe Milky Way is a large group of stars, gas, and dust that is shaped like a disk. It is the galaxy that Earth and the rest of our solar system are a part of. The Hubble Space Telescope takes pictures of the Milky Way by pointing its camera at different parts of the galaxy and taking long exposures, which means it takes a picture for a longer amount of time. This helps the camera capture a lot of light from the stars and other objects in the galaxy, which makes the picture very detailed and clear. \nThe Hubble Space Telescope is able to take pictures of the Milky Way from its orbit around Earth because it is far away from the Earth's atmosphere. The Earth's atmosphere can make it difficult to see objects in space clearly, because it can cause the light from those objects to become distorted. But the Hubble Space Telescope is above the Earth's atmosphere, so it can see objects in space much more clearly. This is why it is able to take such detailed pictures of the Milky Way and other objects in space.",

They entered by forcing a cartoonist at gunpoint to enter in the passcode to the building . They shouted , \" Allahu Akbar ! \" and then open fired . They shot and killed 12 people , and wounded an additional 11 . Two that were killed were police officers . One officer was executed .

The gunmen escaped in a getaway car , hijacked another car , and then ran over a pedestrian and shot at other police cars . The incident is the deadliest mass murder to occur on French soil since 1989 .",
      "Just FYI folks , \" Charlie Hebdo \" is the name of the newspaper , NOT a person killed by this vile act of terrorism .",
      "French here . I thought I might give some insight on that tragic event . As it has been said , yesterday around 11:30 two heavily armed , masked men rushed into a satirical newspaper , Charlie Hebdo ( \" Charlie Weekly \" ) , and massacred 12 persons and injured 11 . Some background on the target . Charlie Hebdo 's creation goes back to 1970 , when it succeeded to Hara - Kiri , another satirical paper created 10 years earlier . So yeah , it 's a major title , a big part of our cultural identity , a flagship of our freedom of speech . Indeed , charlie hebdo has a long history riddled with lots of trials from a lot of people they made fun of -and boy , are there a lot of them . They had no particular target and hit on everything without distinction . Muslims obviously , but also christians , jews , politicians , culture , cults ... They spared literally no one . The 12 victims were not anonymous . They were specifically targeted for being the backbone of the paper . They were all famous , some of them having drawned for Charlie for several decades . * * They were all under police protection for several years * * , constantly receiving death threats mostly for satirizing Islam . In november 2011 they published a special edition called \" Charia hebdo \" ( from Sharia , islamic law ) in wich the prohet Muhammet was \" editor in chief \" . One of the drawing pictured him facepalmed muttering \" it 's hard to be loved by morons \" . They were the victim of several attacks , including an arson that burned their office to the ground on the day of the release . We french people love that kind of bold persons , not afraid of pressing were it hurts for a good laugh . We loved them , even more today . Now a little word on the situation here in the aftermath . Two suspects have been identified and are being actively tracked down in one of the biggest manhunt the country has ever seen . How do we know it 's them ? Those morons crashed their car fleeing from the scene , and hijacked another one ... Leaving in the other some clothes and some ID ... The whole country is now on \" national day of mourning \" ( deuil national ) . It 's an extremely rare situation called by the president , and it 's only the fifth time it 's been called since 1970 . 3 of them were for the death of former presidents ( including De Gaulle ) , the 4th was for 9/11 . All in all , that 's all that 's being talked about on TV since yesterday , and it 's far from being over . * * This morning , a masked man opened fire with an assault rifle in the streets , killing a police officer and severely wounding another one * * . We do n't know much about this event yet , let alone if it is linked to yesterday 's . In a nutshell , I 've never seen my country so shocked , but I 'm only 32 . Here are some of the cartoons that caused trouble to Charlie Hebdo . Let 's not forget them . Let 's not be feared of showing them . Let 's defend the freedom of pissing off morons .

The amniotic fluid also helps to protect the baby's skin from being damaged or infected while they are developing in the womb. When a baby is born, they are usually covered in a thin layer of a substance called vernix, which helps to protect their skin and keep it moisturized. After birth, the baby's skin will start to dry out a bit, but it should still remain smooth and soft.

For example, it could be used to signal that the quarterback is changing the play at the line of scrimmage, or it could be used to indicate that the quarterback is expecting a certain defensive alignment from the opposing team. \nThe use of code words like \"Omaha\" is common in football, as it allows teams to keep their plays and strategies hidden from their opponents.

    "question": "Considering sex is a key for the continuation of the species survival , what benefit is there for most societies being so squeamish about it ? Is there an evolutionary or psychological benefit of being puritanical ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Being worried about reproduction more has to do with societal structure than the existence of the race ; who is responsible for raising the child ( an expensive prospect ) and what rights of inheritance the child has are very important parts of many societies .",
      "There is no evolutionary or psychological benefit to being puritanical . The social stigma against sex is entirely and completely a product of fundamentalist religion over the centuries .",
      "From a starting point , I 'd say NO , there 's no direct , logical benefit to being puritanical from an evolutionary point of view . My personal understanding is that behavior constrictions rise from how societies tend to control activities based on religious beliefs , traditions with ancient origins and/or ( usually ) rudimentary understandings of reality , not to mention other possible reasons like power dynamics and economic forces , most of them interconnected in a way or another . Think about it as starting as a raw moral code that prevents self destruction through murder and crazy violence and slowly changes and grows to encompass several different aspects of life . Societies develop various forms of limiting and controlling sex precisely because it 's such an important aspect of human life , not unlike there are / used to be regulations on what foods you could eat and when and where you should sleep . Here 's a modern day example : [ On Shabbat , according to Jewish law , there 's a list of 39 types of work that you 're not allowed to do . Over the years , these types of work have been interpreted by different rabbis as technology and lifestyle changed . The end result is that * * you 're not allowed to drive , use the phone , turn on the lights , cook food , or even tear off a piece of toilet paper to wipe your ass**](http://www . URL_0 /article_20923_5 - bizarre - realities - life - at - edge - gaza.html ) - from the humoristic URL_0 Think about it : if you control sex , you control the birth rates of the population , the possible economic and political gains obtained from pre - arranged marriages and even the people 's general happiness . This already presents a superficial analysis of societal regulation of behavior and the forces and causes behind them . [ This website in particular ] ( URL_3 ) is very useful with its compilations of theories and the many different observations and summaries it offers , if anyone 's interested in learning more . One of the possible explanations for the logic behind making certain activities taboo or , at least , restricting them , comes from the understandings of social structure by people like [ Radcliffe - Brown ] ( URL_2 ) . For him , in a simplified view , practices and beliefs in societies always serve certain functions , contributing in a certain way to the success of society . Say you are in a certain technological step and do n't understand the intricacies of pregnancy . Your wife keeps having miscarriages and no one knows why , except for the local religious figure , who has an explanation related to your religion and/or lifestyle ( maybe you did n't sacrifice enough animals ? did n't pray after having sex ? did something the rest of the population is n't used to and , therefore , finds strange ? ) . The point is , people start believing in the religious figure 's instructions , maybe because they know somebody who knows somebody who was healed when they followed all instructions or maybe because everybody 's been following their instructions for centuries already , so why should they stop ? * * TL;DR * * Sex is a very intimate and almost mandatory activity for humans , making it so that it can be done in a multitude of ways and some people might never learn about them , thus allowing for some aspects of it to be found strange or even straight up repulsive ( think homosexuality for people that spent their entire lives thinking about heterosexuality not only as the norm , but as the only logical choice ) . Combine that with the rise of social and religious constructions that mix legitimate spiritual concepts with desire for power and you 've got a subject that is very easy to control and can be very lucrative/ influential . Thus , the answer : no , puritanism does n't usually rise from objectives that favor the continuation of the species , it 's a social construction , although that could mean there 's a psychological * motion * behind it , but not strictly a benefit ."

      "There are a few reasons why some societies may be more reserved or modest when it comes to discussing or depicting sexual behavior. One reason is that sex can be a private or personal matter for many people, and some cultures place a high value on privacy and modesty. Additionally, many societies have social norms and taboos around sex that are intended to regulate sexual behavior and protect against certain risks or harms, such as unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections, or exploitation. These norms and taboos may vary from culture to culture, and they may change over time. \nAnother reason why some societies may be more puritanical about sex is that they may have religious or moral values that discourage or prohibit certain types of sexual behavior. For example, some religions view sex as something that should only occur within the context of marriage, and they may consider certain behaviors, such as premarital sex or homosexuality, to be sinful or immoral. \nIt's worth noting that there isn't necessarily an evolutionary or psychological benefit to being puritanical about sex. Different societies have different values and beliefs about what is acceptable or appropriate when it comes to sexual behavior, and these values and beliefs can influence how people think and talk about sex. Ultimately, the way that a society approaches sex is shaped by a variety of factors, including cultural, religious, and social norms.",

The Space Shuttle was a reusable spacecraft that was used for many different missions, including transporting astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS). It was a very advanced and complex vehicle, but it also had some limitations. \nOne of the reasons NASA decided to use rockets instead of a new upgraded type of Space Shuttle for the Orion spacecraft is that rockets are generally more powerful and can reach higher altitudes and faster speeds than the Space Shuttle. This is important for deep space missions, such as going to the Moon or Mars, because these destinations are much farther away from Earth than the ISS. \nAnother reason is that the Space Shuttle required a lot of maintenance and preparation between flights, which made it less flexible and efficient than rockets. Rockets can be launched more quickly and can be used for a wider range of missions. \nFinally, NASA is always looking for ways to improve and advance its technology, and developing a new type of Space Shuttle would have been a very expensive and time-consuming project.

Since you made the mental ability a defining trait , then technically a dumb Blue * is n't * a Blue nor is a smart Green a Green . It just complicates the issue without resolving anything . To tie this back to the real world , the fact is , we can ( and do ) acknowledge statistical differences among groups of the population with respect to their race , both physically and mentally . But it is not appropriate to then suggest that those attributes are inherent to that race , that race has * anything * to do with those attributes . Race is a poorly defined label , even when you reduce it to a simple acknowledgement of skin color . And it is n't just about political correctness or racism either . Thinking that things like intelligence are qualities of race cloud the real issue . For example , in the United States , minorities make up more of the poorer and lower social and economic classes than whites do . So , as a consequence , the average quantity and quality of education among minorities is generally less than that of whites . So * of course * tests of mental abilities will result in minorities performing statistically worse than whites , * but that has nothing to do with their race . * So if you walk away from that study concluding that minorities are less intelligent than whites , then you 're ignoring the issue of * why * they performed poorly and , therefore , are precluding efforts to try and remedy what is most likely a problem . After all , we can at least recognize poverty and lack of education as a problem that is theoretically fixable . If you just make it a matter of race , you 're basically saying there is nothing you can do about it , it 's just the way they are . And it is n't .",

    "question": "Why exactly are people shy ? I 'm guessing it 's because of a lot of things , but could be because of anxiety , which leads them into thinking / caring of what others think of them ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "It 's a variety of things . Shy people can just prefer to not interact much with others , they can be very introverted or just a little introverted , they can be aloof and unconcerned with socialisation , they can be actively against socializing due to antisocial disorders , they can be low - selfesteem , they can have anxiety issues , they can be off in their own world , they can be raised in a culture that encourages stoicism and only speaking when necessary , and so on . There is many different types of \" shyness \" and many different reasons for why people may be shy in different ways . We as a society tend to think of shy people as X or Y. I 'm a fairly extroverted person , but I imagine that if I was introverted , I 'd feel fairly fed up with the generalizing perceptions of introverted / shy people . It 's possible that a lot of shy people get crap from it from their friends and family at a young age ( why do nt you talk more ? What 's wrong ? ) and it really turns them off of socialization , and as a result they actually become more \" shy \" than they naturally ever were .",
      "There 's a difference between introversion and shyness . Personally I am introvert , not shy . What that means for me is that after a certain amount of time I am \" spent \" and I prefer to just not talk to people / ignore them / hide somewhere . Shy people , by observation , just generally wait for being approached / talked to . Based on an ex , it comes down to be insecure about how you 're being perceived and not wanting to \" loo like an idiot \" .",

    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "People can be shy for a variety of reasons. Some people may be shy because they are naturally introverted, which means that they tend to feel more comfortable being alone or with a small group of close friends, rather than being in large groups or around new people. Others may be shy because they are anxious about social situations, and may worry about what others think of them or about making mistakes. \nStill others may be shy because of past negative experiences, such as being teased or bullied, which can make them feel self-conscious or afraid of being rejected. Some people may also be shy because of cultural or social norms that discourage them from speaking up or expressing themselves. \nOverall, shyness is a normal and common human emotion, and it's something that many people experience at some point in their lives. It's important to remember that everyone is different and that it's okay to be shy. With time and practice, many people are able to overcome their shyness and become more confident in social situations.",

      "Falling oil prices can have both positive and negative effects on an economy. On the positive side, lower oil prices can lead to lower costs for businesses and consumers, which can lead to increased spending and economic growth. For example, if the price of gasoline falls, people may be more likely to take road trips or drive more, which can boost tourism and other industries. \nHowever, falling oil prices can also have negative effects on certain sectors of the economy, particularly those that are heavily dependent on the oil industry. For example, if the price of oil falls, it may be less profitable for oil companies to extract and sell oil, which can lead to layoffs and reduced investment in the industry. This can have a ripple effect, as businesses and workers in other industries that rely on the oil industry, such as transportation and manufacturing, may also be negatively impacted. \nIn summary, falling oil prices can lead to lower costs and increased economic activity in some areas, but they can also lead to economic challenges for industries and communities that rely heavily on the oil industry.",

If we each had 5 books , there 'd be 120 different possible orders . Odds that you and I picked the same order are low , and even with 6 or 7 people , there 's still little chance of there being any matches .

The exact shape and size of a snowflake depends on the temperature and humidity in the air as it falls to the ground. Because these conditions are always changing, it's unlikely that two snowflakes will form under exactly the same conditions and therefore be exactly the same. \nScientists have studied snowflakes for many years, and they have never found two that are exactly the same.

This can make it easier and more convenient for the passport holder to travel internationally, which is why these passports are sometimes considered more valuable. \nAnother factor that can make a passport more valuable is the overall reputation and stability of the country. Passports from countries that are seen as safe and well-governed are often more highly valued because they can give the passport holder access to more opportunities and privileges when traveling or living abroad. \nFinally, some passports are considered more valuable because they can provide their holders with certain privileges or benefits, such as access to exclusive clubs or discounts on certain products or services.

If there is no inflation, you can buy 10 toys with your $100 because 100 / 10 = 10. But if there is 2% inflation, the toy will cost $10.20 the next year. This means you can only buy 9.8 toys because 100 / 10.2 = 9.8. \nInflation can be a problem because it reduces the purchasing power of money. This means that you can't buy as much with the same amount of money as you could before. This can be frustrating and can make it harder to afford the things you need. \nIt's true that some people's incomes may go up as prices increase, but not everyone's incomes will go up at the same rate as prices.

    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "The reason why 4-bar rhythms are common in music is that they feel natural and easy to follow. 4-bar rhythms are found in many different types of music from all over the world, and they have been used for centuries. \nOne reason why 4-bar rhythms might be particularly appealing is that they divide the music into manageable chunks. When you listen to a song with a 4-bar rhythm, it's easy to follow along and tap your foot or clap your hands to the beat. \nAnother reason is that 4-bar rhythms are very flexible. Musicians can easily add or subtract beats, change the tempo, or change the arrangement of the music within a 4-bar structure, which gives them a lot of creative freedom. \nThere isn't anything inherently \"right\" about the number 4 when it comes to music. Different cultures and musical traditions have their own rhythmic structures, and some of them use rhythms that are based on 5, 7, or other numbers of beats. Ultimately, what makes a rhythm appealing is how it feels to the listener and how it fits with the other elements of the music.",

      "Expiry dates are put on medications for a number of reasons. One of the main reasons is that after a certain amount of time, medications may start to break down or become less effective. This is because they may become contaminated with bacteria or other substances, or because the active ingredients may start to break down or change in some way. \nIt is generally not recommended to use medications past their expiry date, because there is no way to know for sure how they will work or if they will be safe to use. In some cases, medications that are past their expiry date may be less effective or may not work at all. In other cases, they may be more harmful or toxic than they would be if they were used before the expiry date. \nIf you are in need of medication and the only option you have is a medication that has expired, it is generally safer to get a new prescription from a healthcare provider than to use the expired medication. This is because your healthcare provider can help you determine if the medication is still safe to use, and can also help you find a suitable alternative if needed.",

This would have the unfortunate effect of destroying the planet . Other problems would be heat would create convective winds around the sun . The winds would approach thousands - maybe millions - of miles per hour which would wreak havoc on our own atmosphere . Depending on the composition of the air , it could have tremendous effects on our atmosphere - chemically things could bond and create poisonous gasses or what not . Space flight might not be as difficult , but it would have new problems . We could use the air as a fuel source ( possibly like airplanes use our atmosphere as half of their fuel source , the O2 ) , but we could n't achieve as fast speeds because the friction with the air would heat the spaceship and burn it up if we go too fast . Therefore , we 'd be limited to a few mach ( probably ~ Mach 5 , or about 3500 miles per hour ) . That the slower speeds it would take 81 days to reach the moon ( instead of the 3 days it takes now ) and to mars ... it takes about 9670 days , or 27 years ! Other effects might include things like gravity causing the air to slowly condense back in on itself so the universe would just re - collapse into a ball , ignite like a star , blow up and leave a big black hole . Gasses around black holes would be accelerated high enough to create constant outpourings of x - rays and gamma rays .

      "Outer space is a vacuum, which means it's a place where there is very little matter, including air. If outer space were filled with air, it would be very different from what we experience on Earth. \nOne big difference is that there would be air pressure in outer space. On Earth, the air we breathe is heavy and pushes down on us, which is why we need to wear special suits to go outside in space. If there were air in outer space, it would also push down on us, but in a much weaker way. \nAnother difference is that things would be able to move through the air in outer space. Right now, objects in space like satellites and space stations have to use rockets or other special equipment to move around. But if there were air in outer space, they could just use their wings like airplanes do. \nOne unpleasant effect on our planet could be that the air in outer space would be very thin and not have enough oxygen for us to breathe.

      "The \"thigh gap\" refers to a space between a person's thighs when they stand with their feet together and their knees facing forward. Some people believe that having a thigh gap is a sign of attractiveness or good health, and it has gained popularity as a physical ideal on social media and in some fashion magazines. \nHowever, it's important to note that the size of a person's thighs, or whether or not they have a gap between them, does not determine their attractiveness or health. In fact, having a thigh gap is not something that everyone can naturally achieve, as it is largely determined by genetics and body type. Some people may be more prone to having a thigh gap, while others may not be. \nIt's also worth noting that the idea of the thigh gap has been criticized for promoting unhealthy or unrealistic body standards, and for potentially causing people to feel self-conscious about their own bodies. It's important to remember that all bodies are unique and beautiful, and that there is no one \"perfect\" body type.",

      "Electric motors can produce a lot of torque, which makes them very good at providing strong and instant acceleration. This is why electric motors are used in some types of vehicles, such as electric cars and buses, where quick acceleration is important. \nHowever, electric motors also have some limitations that make them less practical for use in semi trucks and other heavy-duty vehicles. One of the main limitations is the amount of energy that can be stored in batteries. Batteries are currently not able to store as much energy as diesel fuel, which means that electric vehicles typically have a shorter range than diesel vehicles. This makes them less practical for long haul trucking, where the vehicles need to be able to travel long distances without stopping to recharge. \nAnother limitation of electric motors is the amount of time it takes to recharge the batteries. It can take several hours to fully charge the batteries of an electric vehicle, whereas a diesel vehicle can be refilled with fuel in just a few minutes. \nOverall, electric motors have the potential to be a very efficient and effective way to power vehicles, but they are not yet practical for use in all types of vehicles due to the current limitations of batteries and charging infrastructure.",

      "I would imagine that it 's an instantaneous , nonverbal way of communicating discomfort , pain or pleasure to other individuals . Without the visual feedback , it might be possible for larger individuals to damage smaller ones without knowing it . Along with squeals , chirps , and yelps , it helps prevent accidental or intentional damage . Also , it can act as a nonverbal signal for help to other individuals ( in the example of pain or anguish . ) You see your fellow human squirming violently from afar and you know something is up .",

      "My vote is that the two are reflexive actions designed to further genetics . When experiencing pain , an individual reflexively attempts to avoid or alleviate the source , as it is often hazardous to the health . During orgasm , one reflexively acts in a way that ( presumably ) encourages fertilization , by offering a more direct or reliable passage for sperm . Incidentally , I 'm told that orgasm is handled by the same sort of pathways your body handles reflex , via a nerve loop in your spine . I 'd heard that orgasm research requires an electrode targeted to your spine"

      "The instinct to writhe or squirm during intense pain or pleasure is likely related to the body's natural response to try to protect itself or cope with the sensations it is experiencing. When we are in pain, for example, our bodies may automatically try to move or shift in an effort to find a position that is more comfortable or to get away from the source of the pain. Similarly, during pleasure, our bodies may naturally respond by moving or writhing as a way to enhance or intensify the sensation. This can be seen in many different animals as well, and is thought to be an evolutionary adaptation that helps us to survive and thrive in the face of different stimuli.",

    "human_answer": [
      "There 's no universal answer , since contracts can be written in many different ways , but some sort of revenue share is going to be pretty common . The simplest example would be if an artist allows a publisher to sell their music in any which way , with a percentage - based revenue split . Most artists , including musicians , authors , and so on , will end up assigning copyright to their publishers , so that the publisher ends up owning the piece . This makes it easier for the publisher to make business deals and enforce copyright protections , since they 're well - equipped for doing that . Hopefully the artist gets a good deal out of it , too .",

    "generated_answer": [
      "Music royalties are payments made to songwriters, composers, and music publishers for the use of their musical works. When a song is played on the radio, streamed on a music service like Spotify, or used in a movie or television show, the copyright holders of the song are entitled to receive a royalty payment. \nThere are different types of music royalties, but one common type is a performance royalty. This is a payment that is made every time a song is performed publicly, such as when it is played on the radio or at a live event. Performance royalties are typically collected by a performing rights organization (PRO), such as ASCAP or BMI, on behalf of the songwriters and composers. \nThe amount of the royalty payment depends on a number of factors, including the type of use (e.g., radio, streaming, live performance), the length of the song, and the specific terms of the license agreement. In general, the longer a song is played, the more the copyright holders will be paid. \nFor example, if a song is used in a movie, the movie studio would typically negotiate a license agreement with the copyright holders (or their representatives) to use the song in the film. The terms of the agreement would determine the amount of the royalty payment, which could be a fixed fee or a percentage of the movie's profits. The copyright holders would then receive their royalty payment when the movie is released and the song is performed publicly as part of the film. \nI hope this helps to explain how music royalties work.

In some cases, employers may be required by their own company policies or by collective bargaining agreements to give their employees a certain amount of notice before terminating their employment. \nIn general, the rules around notice periods and employment are different for employees and employers because they are in different positions in the employer-employee relationship.

    "human_answer": [
      "The main reason why water burns when it goes up your nose is because the salinity of the water does not match the salinity of the cells in your body . The salinity of freshwater is much lower than your body , so when water gets into your nose and into your sinuses , some of the cells that line the sinus and nasal cavities burst open and die because they rapidly suck in water - like overfilling a water balloon . Your body responds by rapidly secreting mucus to coat the remaining cells and protect them from the water .

    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "When water goes up your nose, it can cause a burning sensation because the water irritates the sensitive tissue inside your nostrils. This is called \"nasal irritation.\" When you dive into a pool or take a shower, the water can also cause your sinuses (the air-filled spaces in your skull) to become pressurized. This pressure can cause a burning sensation in your nose, as well as a feeling of congestion or stuffiness. \nYour nose and sinuses are lined with tiny hair-like structures called cilia, which help to filter and moisten the air you breathe. When water gets into your nose, it can disrupt the function of the cilia and cause them to stop working properly. This can lead to irritation and inflammation, which can cause the burning sensation you feel. \nIn addition to the physical sensations, the feeling of water going up your nose can also be a bit scary and uncomfortable. It's important to be careful when diving into pools or taking showers to try to avoid getting water up your nose. If water does go up your nose, it's usually best to just blow your nose gently to get rid of the water and allow your nostrils and sinuses to return to their normal state.",

Now apple could sell a phone through there site for $ 100 and make a profit , but they do n't need to because they know that no store can sell them that cheap . so they sell them for $ 250 which maximizes there profit , without making it cheaper to buy through a store ."

      "There are a few reasons why products sold on infomercials might take longer to deliver than products purchased from a regular store or online retailer. \nFirst, infomercials are often used to sell products that are not widely available in stores or online.

      "Police are public servants and patrol public areas . There generally are n't police patrolling private stadiums and , where there are , their focus is more on the safety of the public / spectators , not the \" performers\"/athletes . So if a police officer were to see an athlete harm another athlete in a way that was * * completely , and explicitly illegal * * , they could and should arrest that individual . The issue is that contact - sports are a consenting arrangement between parties . How absurd would it be for an officer to have arrested Mike Tyson after one of his monster , brutal knock - outs ? Then again , why was n't Mike Tyson arrested after biting off a guy 's ear ? The answer , as pointed out in another comment , is that sports largely police themselves . All participants agree to a certain range of physical contact / harm . This \" consent \" makes much of the contact that occurs not really a \" crime \" and , rather , becomes purely a civil issue . This means that players who believe that another player exceeded the appropriate level of harm they consented to can bring them to court . There was a famous case years ago out of the NFL where a player was hit after the play had ended and was paralyzed . The judges had a lot to deal with . One of my favorite comments was something like , \" In a boxing match , boxers do not get to choose which blows they consent to receiving -- rather , they consent to the entirety of engagement . \" Facts that play into whether something crosses a line are ( a ) how often does it happen in the sport ( are the players aware of the risk ) , ( b ) did the act violate the official , enforced rules of the sport , ( c ) what are the penalties conveyed by the sports organization , etc . * * tl;dr :* * \" Arrested \" is something that happens to people who act in a way that justifies temporarily denying them freedom while the court can figure out if a law has been violated ... in many sports , everyone is a willing , consenting participant which makes it more of a civil issue than a legal one . * * Edit :* * Just to add something I mentioned in a different comment below -- another reason that intentional acts of violence are not criminal in a sport even if they are so seemingly outside the scope of being appropriate is that those acts are usually already handled by some sort of foul / penalty within the game . Hockey , for example , penalizes intentional , violent violations of its rules with varying penalty - box repercussions , suspensions , etc . The fact that specific penalties exist for intentional violent acts is an example of how it * * is * * a part of the game , and it is a part that has been consented to by all parties . Only when it exceeds an extreme , relative level will it become a criminal issue .",
      "Courts have a long standing precedent to let leagues & sports organizations police themselves and for good reason . Sports are physical activities , which means people can hurt each other during the game by playing dirty . Sometimes , the only way to keep the other team from continuing to play dirty is to either openly confront or fight them or play dirty in return . You see a hockey player get hit in the nuts by a stick ... what you did n't see was the entire opposing team , for the last 40 minutes , whacking guys on the back of the calves whenever they skate past just because they can .",

      "Athletes who attack other athletes in the middle of games are usually punished by the rules of the game and the governing bodies of their sports. For example, in hockey, if a player hits another player in the nuts with their stick, they might receive a penalty or be ejected from the game. These punishments are meant to deter players from engaging in dangerous or unsportsmanlike behavior. \nIn some cases, an athlete's actions during a game might be considered criminal, such as if they intentionally hurt another player in a way that goes beyond the rules of the game. In these situations, the police might be called to investigate and the athlete could potentially face criminal charges. However, it is not common for athletes to be arrested on the spot during a game. \nOverall, the goal of punishing athletes who engage in dangerous or unsportsmanlike behavior is to keep the game safe and fair for all players and to maintain the integrity of the sport.",

It's a way for Reddit users to exchange gifts with each other during the holiday season. \nHere's how it works: \n1. First, you need to sign up to participate in Reddit Secret Santa. This usually happens a few months before the event, and you can usually find information about it on the Reddit homepage or in the r/secretsanta subreddit. \n2. Once you've signed up, you'll be asked to fill out a short questionnaire about your interests, likes, and dislikes. This helps the Secret Santa organizers match you with someone who shares similar interests. \n3. After the questionnaire, you'll be paired with another Reddit user who will be your Secret Santa. You'll receive an email or message from the organizers with your match's name and Reddit username. \n4. Your Secret Santa will also receive your name and Reddit username, so you both know who you're buying a gift for. \n5. It's up to you and your Secret Santa to decide on a budget and what kind of gift to get for each other. Some people like to send physical gifts through the mail, while others prefer to send digital gifts, like a gift card or an online game. \n6. Once you've decided on a gift, you'll send it to your Secret Santa through the mail or through an online platform. \n7. At some point during the holiday season, usually around Christmas, you'll both receive your gifts and find out who your Secret Santa was. \nThat's the basic idea of Reddit Secret Santa!

    "question": "what is a panic attack . What do I do if I come home and see my housemate suffering from one . I witnessed one of these this morning . I think I used to have them when I was little but remember nothing of them . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "As someone who suffers from panic attacks on occasion , a great thing to do is to start reading off the symptoms of a panic attack . Unless they 're panicking over something external , most people having a panic attack mistake it for a heart attack . Tingling in extremities , rapid heartbeat ( caused by all that fast breathing ) and so on . Try putting on a metronome ( you can get apps for a smartphone ) to help whoever 's panicking get a sense of time passing . When you 're panicking , your brain starts perceiving everything faster and time slows down . This will also help regulate their breathing . A good pace for breathing is 4 - 7 - 8 : in for four , hold for seven , out for eight .",
      "I am not a doctor . This is not medical advice , but I have lived with three different people prone to panic attacks and learned this that way : * * What happens during a panic attack * * ( Please note : there may be other things at play : this is the \" what happens \" that I know about , and I believe is most common , as I know several people who suffered from these . ) A panic attack is triggered by something - often specific to the person suffering , or sometimes they just happen on their own . The panic response ( in everyone ) triggers heavy breathing to get as much oxygen into the blood as possible ready for a fight - or - flight response . However , in a panic attack this heavy breathing ( hyperventilating ) is overdone , and it actually makes it harder to breath . The sensation of not being able to breath causes new waves of panic , and so it continues . * * What you can do * * Firstly , do not panic yourself . The first time I saw someone have a panic attack I thought she was choking on someone , and started trying to hit her on the back . That was n't so helpful , as it turned out . You should be the paragon of calm . A panic attack is not dangerous . If someone really overdoes the hyperventilating they will trigger a \" breathing reset \" sort of thing , which sorts out their breathing and they quickly calm down . Even if this does n't happen ( which I 've never known to happen ) the worst that can happen is that they 'll fall asleep , but anyway . Secondly , be comforting . One person I knew who was prone to them had flashbacks to a traumatic event that triggered her . By hugging her closely , and talking to her I 'd override her flashback - senses with real - world - here - and - now senses and bring her out of the flashback and she 'd calm down quickly . To her I said things like \" You 're okay , you 're safe . You 're here with me now . Look at me , nothing here can hurt you ... \" etc ... Another person I knew had more random ones . With her I 'd do the same , but try to get her to focus on deep breaths . With a third person I tried the deep breaths thing , but she said it only made her want to punch me , only she was too deep into panic mode to do so . With her I 'd just hold her , try to say calming things and use the tightness of my grip ( tighter , gentler , etc ... ) to try to subtly adjust her breathing and found that worked . Thirdly , talk to them . Some people do n't like talking about it , but you can talk about how to help them . This means you find out what makes certain people want to punch you , or useful things like the \" bring them out of flashbacks \" and stuff .",

      "A panic attack is a sudden and intense feeling of fear or anxiety that can be accompanied by physical symptoms such as a racing heart, shortness of breath, dizziness, and chest pain. These symptoms can be very frightening and can make someone feel like they are in danger, even if there is no real danger present. \nIf you come home and see your housemate suffering from a panic attack, there are some things you can do to help: \n1. Stay calm and try to stay with them. Panic attacks can be scary, and your housemate may feel very alone and overwhelmed. By staying with them, you can provide support and comfort. \n2. Encourage them to take slow, deep breaths. This can help to calm their body and mind. \n3. Talk to them in a soothing and reassuring voice. Let them know that they are not alone and that you are there to help. \n4. Help them find a comfortable and safe place to sit or lie down. \n5. Offer them a glass of water or a soothing drink. \n6. If the panic attack continues for a long time or if your housemate is in severe distress, consider calling for medical help. \nRemember, panic attacks are not dangerous, and they will usually pass on their own after a few minutes. It's important to reassure your housemate and let them know that they are safe and that the panic attack will eventually end.",

    "question": "What 's the difference between Pubs and Bars ? And where do pubs get their names ? Just a thought that has crossed my mind a couple times - I also wondered why so many pubs have the same , or similar names ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "I 'm assuming this us a UK based question ? The word pub comes from the name public house . It originally meant a building that was open to the public to come and relax , socialise and most importantly consume alcohol . Noawadays the name public house means a building owned by a brewery , run by a tenant , for the sale and consumption of alcohol . In UK law you must have a license to sell alcohol , a license to have it consumed on your ( public commercial ) premises and another personal license to facilitate this sale . A pub in the UK is owned by the brewery . They have a tenant that buys the business within the building and then gets to keep the profit made from the sale in exchange for meeting the brewery 's minimum sale requirements . They must buy beer from the brewery and if they do n't buy enough they will be kicked out and another tenant will be found . This leads to , in more recent times , more pubs shutting down due to the aggressive nature of breweries . However you can also have free houses ( woohoo ) which are owned and run by the same person . They are open to buy beer from wholesale shops at a much cheaper price than would otherwise be available through the brewery . This means freehouses generally are cheaper than pubs and can have a different clientele . A bar is normally much more about alcohol than socialising . In a pub it is totally fine , in fact often expected , to sit at the bar with your drink and talk to the other people at the bar . You are of course not looked down upon by finding a private area , that is your choice , but it is often polite to stay and chat for a while . Bars are more aimed at limiting the bar area to sale only , once you have your drink you leave and go back to your private area and socialise mainly with those that you came out with . Pubs will often provide entertainment such as music , darts , snooker and/or pool , with snacks and occasionally food served too . Bars also open different hours to pubs . Because pubs are a social location , in the UK at least many pubs open earlier in the day than bars , sometimes noon , but quite often around 4 pm I have found . Bars are more aimed at night time and weekend rushes and are a more commercial location",
      "I was always under the impression a \" bar \" is a feature ( usually a counter ) in an establishment that serves it 's specialty . For example ; oyster bars serve seafood , salad bars serve bunny - food , alcohol bars serve alcohol . Similar to a kitchen , which prepares food in a restaurant . So a pub could have a kitchen and bar inside meaning it serves food and alcohol .",
      "In the US , the term bar pretty generically apples to all drinking establishments while a pub refers to a place that tries to capture the style and atmosphere of a UK pub . A bar can be a dive bar , shorts bar , wine bar , dance club , night club , tavern , pub or any of a countless number of other types of drinking establishment . It can range from a tiny 3 seater at the back of a restaurant to a sprawling multi acre monstrosity ."

      "In general, a pub (short for \"public house\") is a place where people can go to have a drink and socialize. Pubs are often found in the United Kingdom and other parts of the world. They usually serve a variety of alcoholic beverages, such as beer, wine, and cocktails, and may also serve food. \nA bar is a place where people can go to have a drink, socialize, and sometimes dance. Bars are found in many different countries and serve a variety of alcoholic beverages. \nPubs and bars can have similar names because they often serve similar purposes and may be owned by the same company. Some pub and bar names are based on their location, such as \"The Red Lion\" or \"The White Horse,\" while others are based on the theme or decor of the establishment, such as \"The Pirate's Cove\" or \"The Wild West Saloon.\" \nIn general, the main difference between a pub and a bar is that pubs are more traditional and often have a more relaxed, family-friendly atmosphere, while bars may be more modern and have a more energetic or nightclub-like atmosphere. However, this is not always the case, and some pubs may have a more lively atmosphere, while some bars may have a more laid-back atmosphere.",

The idea is that by limiting the amount of data that customers can use, the ISPs can manage their network resources more effectively and offer a more stable and reliable service to all of their customers. \nFor example, if an ISP has a limited amount of bandwidth available and all of their customers are using large amounts of data at the same time, it could cause the network to become congested, leading to slower speeds and a less reliable service. By implementing data caps, the ISP can ensure that there is enough bandwidth available for all of their customers to use, even during times of heavy usage. \nWhile data caps may seem inconvenient for people who use a lot of data, they can be a good option for people who don't use the internet very much or who only need a basic level of service.

      "The part that makes people allergic to cats is actually a protein ( FEL D1 ) found in their saliva . When a cat licks herself , she deposits the protein on her skin , and when it dries off , the flakes become airborne and trigger symptoms of allergy in people . So , it 's not the fur that 's the issue , it 's the dead skin . In short , there 's no cat that 's 100 % hypoallergenic , they can only produce less of the protein FEL D1 than regular cats . Some cats tend to be preferred because of trial and error , and even then , some of the most likely to not cause allergies still do because maintenance is required ( like bathing or brushing ) to make those pets optimal .",
      "No animal is truly hypoallergenic . It all depends on what exactly ( saliva , dander , fur ) has the most protein and how much the animal 's activities put those things into the air . This will determine how sensitive the allergic person is to the animal . Even so - called \" hypoallergenic \" breeds ( those who do n't shed or whatever criteria are used ) may elicit a serious reaction and other breeds or individual animals may not . This is why an allergic person even considering adopting or purchasing an animal should meet the individual animal first and observe reactions .

Nothing is more important when looking at individual allergies than examining the individual animal .",

    "generated_answer": [
      "A hypoallergenic animal is one that is less likely to cause an allergic reaction in people who are sensitive to pets. The term \"hypoallergenic\" does not mean that the animal is completely allergy-free, but it usually means that it produces fewer allergens, which are proteins that can cause an allergic reaction. \nDogs and cats have both hair and fur. The main difference between the two is that hair is usually longer and coarser, while fur is shorter and softer. Hair also tends to shed less than fur. Some people believe that animals with hair, rather than fur, are less likely to cause allergies because they produce fewer allergens. However, this is not necessarily true for all hypoallergenic pets. \nThere are several breeds of dogs and cats that are considered hypoallergenic because they produce fewer allergens than other breeds. These breeds may have hair rather than fur, or they may have a different type of fur that is less likely to cause an allergic reaction. Some examples of hypoallergenic dog breeds include the Bichon Frise, Poodle, and Schnauzer. Some examples of hypoallergenic cat breeds include the Devon Rex, Sphynx, and Siamese. \nIt's important to note that while these breeds may be less likely to cause an allergic reaction, they are not completely allergy-free. If you are allergic to pets and want to get one, it's a good idea to spend some time with the animal before you make a commitment to ensure that you are not allergic to it.",

      "There are many complex reasons why some countries, including many in Africa, have not developed as quickly as others in terms of technology, politics, and humanitarian issues. Here are a few reasons that might help explain it: \n1. History: Many African countries have a history of colonialism, which often meant that their resources were exploited by other countries and their own governments were not allowed to make decisions that were in the best interest of their people. This can make it hard for a country to develop and progress. \n2. Poverty: Many African countries have high levels of poverty, which can make it difficult for people to afford the education and resources needed to advance in science, technology, and other fields. \n3. Infrastructure: In order for a country to have a strong economy and support technological and political progress, it needs to have good infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, schools, and hospitals. Some African countries have limited infrastructure, which can make it hard for people to access the resources they need to thrive. \n4. Political instability: Some African countries have had periods of political instability, which can make it hard for the government to focus on long-term development goals. \n5. Natural disasters: Many African countries are prone to natural disasters such as droughts, floods, and earthquakes, which can disrupt development and make it hard for people to live stable, healthy lives. \nIt's important to remember that every country is different and has its own unique challenges. There are many African countries that are making progress and working to overcome these challenges, and it's important to support and encourage their efforts.",

      "[ It 's called the Military - Industrial Complex ] ( URL_0 ) .

    "question": "Why do people have fetishes , and why are some more extreme than others ? Some people like feet , others like bondage , and a few like balloons . Why is that ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Early psychology assumed that fetishism either is being conditioned or imprinted or the result of a strong emotional ( possibly traumatic ) or physical experience . Often , these experiences occurred in early childhood . For example , an individual who has been physically abused could either have a sexual obsession with intercourse , or they could be completely terrified by even the idea of being touched . Physical factors like genetic disposition are another common possible explanation . In the following , the most important theories are presented in chronological order : Alfred Binet suspected fetishism was the pathological result of associations . Accidentally simultaneous presentation of a sexual stimulus and an inanimate object , he argued , led to the object being permanently connected to sexual arousal . The sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld followed another line of thought when he proposed his theory of partial attractiveness in 1920 . According to his argument , sexual attractiveness never originates in a person as a whole but always is the product of the interaction of individual features . He stated that nearly everyone had special interests and thus suffered from a healthy kind of fetishism , while only detaching and overvaluing of a single feature resulted in pathological fetishism . Today , Hirschfeld 's theory is often mentioned in the context of gender role specific behavior : females present sexual stimuli by highlighting body parts , clothes or accessories ; males react to them . * * tl;dr : It 's a normal and healthy part of human sexuality . * *",
      "It 's all part of human psychology . It 's normal to have fetishes . People like different food , people have different fetishes . Do n't let anyone tell you that your fetish is weird and disturbing because it 's not . It 's part of who you are",
      "I think it 's worth noting that fetishes and kinks are separate and different things .

Additionally , kinks almost always revolve around sexuality , whereas fetishes can be really bizarre sometimes ."

      "A fetish is a strong sexual interest in a specific object, body part, or activity. People have different fetishes because everyone is different, and everyone has their own unique likes and dislikes when it comes to sexual attraction.

It's important to remember that having a fetish does not make someone abnormal or unhealthy. However, it's also important to recognize that some fetishes can be dangerous or harmful to others, and it's important to respect other people's boundaries and consent. \nIt's not clear why some fetishes are more extreme or uncommon than others.

This can happen because the heat of cooking can cause the breakdown of some of the nutrients, or because the nutrients can leach out into the water that the vegetables are cooked in. \nMicrowaving can also cause the loss of some nutrients in vegetables because it uses high-frequency waves to cook the food, which can cause the breakdown of some nutrients. \nTo help prevent the loss of nutrients when cooking vegetables, there are a few things you can try: \n1. Use minimal water when cooking vegetables, or steam them instead of boiling them. \n2. Cook vegetables for the shortest amount of time possible. \n3. Eat the vegetables as soon as they are cooked, or store them properly to help preserve the nutrients. \n4. Eat a variety of vegetables to ensure you are getting a wide range of nutrients. \n5.

This means that they might want to update the appearance of their vehicles to reflect current trends and styles. \nFinally, it can be expensive to develop and produce new vehicles, and car and truck companies need to consider whether there is enough demand for a particular type of vehicle to justify the cost. If a company thinks that there is not enough demand for a new vehicle that looks like an older model, they might decide not to invest in creating it. \nI hope this helps to explain things!

      "As someone who dislikes them all equally , I 'll give it a go . At least no one can accuse me of being biased . * * Conservatives * * - nicknamed the Tories . The larger party in the current coalition government . A centre - right party , and so are interested in lowering taxes and using free trade as a means to bolster the economy . They believe in small government , which under Thatcher meant privatisation of public services like railways , utilities and the mail . These services used to be run by the government , but were sold off to private companies . Under the current administration , they have been cutting the budgets of remaining public services like welfare , local authorities and the NHS at the same time as cutting taxes for top - earners and letting companies like Starbucks and Vodafone away with not paying corporation tax . Basically letting the rich get richer and the poor get shat on . * * Labour * * - traditionally the party of the working class , and up until the late 1990s , the opposite of the Tories . They are a centre - left party , interested in a society in which the rich help the poor by way of free public services , a robust welfare system , and higher taxation for the wealthy . Before the 1997 general election , Tony Blair took the party in a new direction ( \" New Labour \" ) which similarly appealed to the middle classes as well as the working class . Effectively , he moved the party away from all - out socialism to a more centrist party . The party is now at odds with itself , with some members looking for \" Blairism , \" a more centrist party , and others still rocking the old socialism . The party does not have a strong leader , they are about to lose swathes of voters in Scotland which was previously a Labour stronghold ( more on this later ) , and do not have policies which could reverse the damage done to the lower classes ' quality of life under the current administration . If British politics was Sega vs Nintendo in the 90s , then Labour are Sega . They used to be giants , now they 're fucking nothing . * * Liberal Democrats * * - The smaller party in the current coalition . Another centre - left party , but a little more radical and progressive than Labour . Since Tony Blair , they have moved to occupy the leftist void left by Labour 's move to the centre . They have always been a little too intellectual and \" out there \" to engage the working class as Labour did , but they have strong policies on social justice , welfare and the role of local authority . There were a strong third party when British politics was all Labour vs Tory . Since coming to power as part of the coalition , the party has been on a thundering campaign of self - harm . They do n't have the electoral clout to stop the Tories ' harsher policies , and have gone back on their own election promises ( like not raising tuition fees ) . Their leader was once seen as a ray of sunshine in British politics , now he is just Cameron 's stooge . * * UKIP * * - the UK Independence party . The party started as a crowd of ex - Tories who were annoyed by the Conservative party 's embracing of European politics . They pledged to withdraw the UK from the European Union . They do alarmingly well in council and European elections , and seem to draw media attention far greater than their electoral representation should warrant . They have policies on immigration that seem outright racist , and have a habit of blaming immigration for all the country 's woes . People will still vote for them , because people turn to nationalism in times of austerity , sad as that is . * * SNP * * - the Scottish National Party . Speaking of nationalism ... There was a referendum on Scottish independence this year . The pro - independence side lost , but not by very much . The final vote was 55%-45 % in favour of staying in the union . The SNP was the largest party in the Yes coalition ( the pro - indy side ) , and their membership has skyrocketed since the referendum . They are now apparently the third - largest party in the UK , despite only representing 10 % of its population . Scottish Labour were pro - union during the referendum , which many party supporters saw as a betrayal , since they were jumping into bed with the Tories ( properly called the Conservative & Unionist Party ) . Labour support in Scotland has plummeted . Away from the referendum , the SNP do extraordinarily well as leaders of the devolved Scottish Government . They are the majority party in an electoral system that is not supposed to allow one party to hold an outright majority . They have very popular policies like free travel for over-60s , free prescriptions for all , low tuition fees and a student loan system , and a freeze on council tax . They are expected to do very well indeed in the next general election , perhaps representing a majority of Scottish voters at Westminster . * * Plaid Cymru * * - the Welsh national party . Not as popular as the SNP , but not as radical either . They do n't advocate an independent Wales ( despite a lot of Welsh support for just that ) , they only seek to look after Welsh interests in Westminster and the Welsh assembly , which they lead in coalition with Labour . With nationalism on the rise nationwide , they may see a surge in votes at the next election , but not to the same degree as the SNP are expected to . * * Greens * * - as with Green parties worldwide , they have policies of environmental responsibility , sustainability and social justice . I actually like their policies a lot , I 'm even a member , but this is not their time . The Scottish Greens were pro - independence and saw a similar surge in membership post - referendum , but not on anything like the scale that the SNP saw . The Green Party of England & Wales have an elected member and look likely to add a couple more by careful targeting of election seats , but they are n't a party of government quite yet . * * Others * * - there 's also all the Northern Irish parties , which would be an essay unto themselves , and a bunch of parties without any seats right now who do n't look likely to get any in the next election , like the Christian Democratic Party , the Pirate Party , the Scottish Socialists , the Monster Raving Loony Party ...",

    "question": "how do hostile takeovers work . And what 's up with 5 % . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "A \" hostile takeover \" allows a bidder to take over a target company whose management is unwilling to agree to a merger or takeover . A takeover is considered \" hostile \" if the target company 's board rejects the offer , but the bidder continues to pursue it , or the bidder makes the offer directly after having announced its firm intention to make an offer . A hostile takeover can be conducted in several ways . A tender offer can be made where the acquiring company makes a public offer at a fixed price above the current market price . Tender offers in the United States are regulated by the Williams Act . An acquiring company can also engage in a proxy fight , whereby it tries to persuade enough shareholders , usually a simple majority , to replace the management with a new one which will approve the takeover . Another method involves quietly purchasing enough stock on the open market , known as a \" creeping tender offer \" , to affect a change in management . In all of these ways , management resists the acquisition , but it is carried out anyway .",
      "I 'm not American , so I 'm not sure what you mean by 5 % . There are different ways to conduct a hostile takeover , but a typical Gordon Geckoesque way would be decreasingthe value of the stocks , buying up enough to get influence in the company ( in Sweden generally 10 % of the votes ) , and then either sneakily or openly buying up enough stocks from prefential owners or on the open market to wield control of the company . It often involves shareholders grouping up . When control has been gained , a company can be gutted , directions can be switched and reserves can be liquidated . For example , Volvo at times have had more liquid reserves than they have had share value making it an ideal takeover . At that point , they try to buy back their own stocks or invest somehow to avoid shenanegans .",
      "5 % is the SEC limit where an investor must announce their ownership publicly . Most hostile takeover artists do it serially so once they have taken an interest in the company , management gets a warning to make their shareholders happy ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "A hostile takeover is when a company tries to take control of another company without the support of the company's management or board of directors. This can happen when the company that is trying to take over, called the \"acquirer,\" makes an offer to buy the other company, called the \"target,\" directly to the target's shareholders. The acquirer usually offers a higher price per share than what the shares are currently worth on the stock market, which can be tempting for the target's shareholders. \nOne way that the acquirer can try to take over the target is by buying a large number of the target's shares, usually at least 5%. When an acquirer owns 5% or more of a company's shares, it is required to disclose this information to the public and the company. This is because owning a large percentage of a company's shares can give the acquirer significant influence over the company's decisions. \nIf the acquirer is able to buy enough shares to gain control of the target, it can then try to replace the target's management and board of directors with its own people. This can be done through a vote of the shareholders. If the acquirer is successful in replacing the management and board, it can then take control of the company and make decisions about how to run it. \nHowever, hostile takeovers can be risky and can sometimes lead to legal battles between the acquirer and the target. The target's management and board may also try to fight the takeover by trying to find another company to buy the target or by making it more difficult for the acquirer to buy the necessary shares.",

    "human_answer": [
      "NHL and the NBA are business associations that exist for the purpose of making profit . They 've expanded into Canada ( NBA ) and the USA ( NHL ) when it is profitable for them to do so .",
      "Well , the NHL is easy to answer because the NHL did n't expand into Canada . The NHL actually started in Canada , when it was formed in 1917 out of the remnants of what was the NHA ( National Hockey Association ) with 4 teams ; The Montreal Canadiens , Montreal Wanderers , Ottawa Senators and the Quebec Bulldogs . This organization later absorbed several U.S. hockey leagues , so technically the NHL expanded into the U.S. , not the other way around . =) URL_0 As for the NBA , they were just looking for new territory to expand the game . They know there 's a lot of basketball fans in Canada , so they figured they 'd try a couple of teams up there . The Vancouver team was a bust , but the Raptors seem to be holding on fairly well .",
      "Good question . The NBA expanded into Canada to try to loosen the popularity grip Hockey has over the country ; but it was not aware that the NHL had a solid working operation . MLB did the same when they created the Montreal Expos and Toronto Bluejays . It turns out that Canadians really do love their hockey and as a result one of the two expanded NBA franchises moved from Vancouver to Memphis , hence the Memphis Grizzlies ( how many goddamn grizzlies are there in Memphis ? NONE ! ) ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "American sports leagues like the NHL (National Hockey League) and NBA (National Basketball Association) have Canadian teams because Canada is part of North America and has a strong interest in sports. These sports leagues have teams from both the United States and Canada because they want to be able to include as many fans as possible from both countries. \nIn the NHL, there are seven Canadian teams, including the Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, Vancouver Canucks, and Winnipeg Jets. In the NBA, there is only one Canadian team, the Toronto Raptors. \nHaving Canadian teams in these leagues allows fans in Canada to root for a team that is located closer to them, rather than having to support a team that is far away in the United States. It also allows the leagues to expand their reach and potentially attract more fans from Canada. \nOverall, having Canadian teams in American sports leagues helps to bring people from different countries together through their shared love of sports.",

    "question": "Why is giving money as a gift considered impersonal but giving gift cards is fine ? It just seems like it 's virtually the same concept . If anything I 'd rather have money since gift cards restrict where you can spend it . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Depending on what the card is , it can show knowledge of the person and be directed towards a specific theme that interests them that the giver was unsure as to what specifically within that theme to get . Although , general cards , such as \" Amazon \" gift cards , are too general and kind of impersonal like money . A more thoughtful example : a person who loves board gaming , but , having stepped into a game store and knowing how ridiculously many there are , you have have no idea which the person would want without asking ( and thereby ruining any surprise element anyway ) , so you get the person a gift card to the game store . Another more thoughtful example would be a gift card for a particular experience you think the person would like ( such as a restaurant ) that you want the recipient to experience .",
      "I 've heard of gift cards often being seen as impersonal alongside cash , other times they were perfectly fine . It 's all about the different grade of how personal a gift is . At the most impersonal , there is cash . You are essentially saying \" I did n't know what to get you , so here 's the money to get something \" At slightly less impersonal is gift cards \" I did n't know exactly what you wanted , so here is a gift card for a store / restaurant you really like \" Then it 's stuff like a shirt , or socks , or other generic item \" Here is something I think you 'll like \" And then there is very personal stuff \" Here is something that I had custom ordered / hand made for you \" Money is seen as impersonal because you are saying that you do n't know what the person likes , but you feel you need to give a gift . Gift cards are seen as slightly better because it 's showing that you at least know some of what the person likes , whether is a store , a restaurant or that they like to buy stuff off of Xbox Live .",
      "I think it 's also partly a cultural thing . I 've heard that in some cultures cash is a perfectly acceptable gift . In cultures where it is not , till the advent of gift cards , you had to buy somebody a gift . And also , it probably was n't all too easy to figure out the cost of the gift unless it was something very popular . A gift of cash in these cultures seem like the gifter is lazy and/or the amount may seem on the lower side . Now , with gift cards , in these very same cultures , you have a paradox . It 's kinda like a gift but it really is currency limited to a store . That being said , when lower denominations are involved , a gift card seems a bit more special than hard cold cash . For instance , a $ 20 Starbucks card seems ( even to me ) more special than a $ 20 bill , when both can be used for the exact same purpose ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "Giving money as a gift is often considered impersonal because it can feel like the giver did not put much thought or effort into choosing a gift. A gift card, on the other hand, shows that the giver has at least considered the recipient's interests or needs and has chosen a gift card for a specific store or type of merchandise that the recipient might enjoy. \nGift cards also have the added advantage of being more flexible than cash, as the recipient can choose to use the gift card at a later date or save it for a special occasion. With cash, the recipient may feel pressure to spend it right away or may not know how to best use the money. \nOverall, the main difference between giving money and giving a gift card is the perceived level of thought and effort that goes into the gift. While both options can be practical and appreciated, a gift card can feel more personal and considerate because it shows that the giver took the time to select a gift specifically for the recipient.",

    "human_answer": [
      "They actually go through a process of deconflicting where each object is . We know where pretty much every single shred of thing is there in space above the size of a screw , so we place stuff where they are needed and where they can go . Also ... Space is * huge * there is plenty of room up there .",
      "Turns out , there actually are agencies out there who manage all of this . The most notable being the US Navy . ( I think ? If someone could confirm that that would be great ) Most satellites are destined for geostationary orbit , which is by far the easiest place to manage space traffic . Due to the way geostationary orbit works , any satellite in that orbit will always be at the same height , going the same speed , and in the same direction . Ignoring small perturberances to a satellite 's orbit , you could theoretically line up satellites into a huge conga line that stretches around the Earth , and have it fly around forever without any satellites colliding . In a way , that 's kind of how it works . There is a line of satellites in geostationary orbit stretching around the Earth , filled with all of the gps satellites , all the satellite TV and radio satellites , communications satellites carrying internet traffic , etc , all separated by miles of space between each satellite of course . When someone wants to launch a satellite into geostationary orbit , they pick a spot in this giant conga line and register their choice with the US Navy , then they carefully fly their satellite into its slot in geostationary orbit . Of course , no orbital placement is perfect , and satellites might drift out of their slots , but when that happens , each satellite has on board propulsion systems that can move the satellite back into position . When the satellite is old and outdated , the satellite is usually moved into a higher orbit , called a graveyard orbit , where satellites go to die , and its spot in the conga line goes to another satellite . Other satellites that do n't go into geostationary orbit are usually much harder to control , however , they are watched religiously by workers on the ground . Before any satellite launches , simulations of the satellite 's orbit over its entire lifetime is run , to ensure that the planned orbit will not collide with any other satellites at the same altitude . If a satellite drifts out of its orbit at any time , controllers on the ground will always be there to steer it back into position . Typically when the lifetime for these low orbit satellites is over , they reenter the atmosphere and burn up , ensuring that it does n't become space junk .",
      "The radius of earth is roughly 6400 km . Add to it 200 km of atmosphere , and you end up putting 10 m\u00c2\u00b2 satellites on a 83000 km\u00c2\u00b2 surface . Plenty of space to launch rockets and other satellites . If you 're asking how do we put an object on orbit , it 's easy to understand : we calculate the gravitationnal force between what we want to launch and the object we want it to be on orbit on . Then , we launch the rocket in order for it to be tangent to a circle ( the orbit ) of center the object and of radius the one calculated using the force mentionned earlier . info : F = G*M1*M2 / D\u00c2\u00b2 and a Fundamental Law of Dynamics and it 's done ;)"

    "generated_answer": [
      "Orbiting an object means moving around it in a circle while staying a certain distance away from it. To put an object into orbit around the Earth, we have to use a rocket. \nThe rocket has to be powerful enough to lift the object off the ground and high into the air. Then, the rocket has to be pointed in the right direction and go fast enough to escape the Earth's gravity. If the rocket goes fast enough and is aimed at the right angle, the object will start orbiting the Earth. \nTo make sure that there aren't any collisions with other objects in space, we use a system called \"traffic control.\" Traffic control helps us track where all the objects in space are and where they're going. We use computers to do this. If two objects are going to get too close to each other, we can use traffic control to send a signal to one of the objects and change its course so that it doesn't crash into the other object. This helps us keep track of all the objects in space and make sure that they're all safe.",

When the sheets are rolled, they go through a machine that polishes the metal and gives it a shiny finish on one side. The other side of the foil is left with a dull finish because it is the back side that was not polished by the machine. So, the shiny side of aluminum foil is the side that has been polished and the dull side is the side that has not been polished.",

    "question": "Evolutionarily speaking , why are there different blood types ? There 's A , B , AB , and O but why are there different alleles anyway ? Would n't it be simpler just to have one blood type ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "In general , we have what we call blood types as a result of our immune system , and how it deals with foreign entities . That 's my understanding anyways . You mention evolution in the question , so I 'll address that first . What we call \" evolution \" is more like a result of a number of factors . Understanding that brings us to why we have features that seem useless or even situationally disadvantageous . When a mutation occurs , the mutation itself does n't care about the organism 's chances at survival due to the change . That 's where \" natural selection \" comes into play , where organisms that do n't get to reproduce die off . But if the organism does reproduce , then the change is kept , and is passed on . That 's evolution So then , why do we have different blood types ? Because some where down the line , we developed antigens , and then they split off into two types , and at no point did they disadvantage the organism . They only become disadvantageous when you need to artificially ( the only way you can ) perform a blood - transfusion .",
      "The advantage of the alleles being different and thus having different blood types would be the same as any other diverse \" feature \" we have . Diversity makes it so that one single pathogen or mutation could not wipe out the entire species . It could also be due to the fact that diversity is unavoidable , there are plenty of ways your DNA can ultimately be expressed , modified , translated etc . and this may just lead necessarily to more diverse \" features \" . We see the features we happen to see because those are the ones which are stable and happen to work . Basically , the reasoning is that we have diveristy because without diversity evolution could n't really work the way it did ; and so , partly the reason we have diversity is because evolution did pan out the way it did .",
      "Having different blood types never made any difference to anybody until we started doing blood transfusions very recently evolutionarily speaking ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "Sure! So, blood types are determined by the presence or absence of certain proteins, called antigens, on the surface of red blood cells. There are two main antigens that determine blood type: A and B. People who have the A antigen on their red blood cells are said to have type A blood, while people who have the B antigen on their red blood cells are said to have type B blood. People who have both A and B antigens on their red blood cells are said to have type AB blood, and people who have neither A nor B antigens on their red blood cells are said to have type O blood. \nNow, why do we have different blood types in the first place? Well, that's because different blood types have different functions in the body. For example, type A blood is good at protecting against certain diseases, while type B blood is good at carrying oxygen to the body's tissues. Having different blood types allows our bodies to be better equipped to handle different challenges and situations. \nSo, while it might seem simpler to just have one blood type, having different blood types actually gives us an evolutionary advantage. It's kind of like how humans have different eye colors, or how there are different breeds of dogs - they all have different characteristics that help them thrive in different environments. Does that make sense?",

So your yield is lower which drives prices up . 3 ) You can make cheap processors out of expensive ones if they have a localized defect . Eg . if your 4 - core cpu has a defect in one core , you can just disable that and sell it as a three - core ( or two - core , or single - core ) . 4 ) if the customer wants the most powerful CPU they are willing to pay for it ( because there are use cases where you ca n't scale over multiple machines or multiple processors because of latency and bandwidth constraints ) .",

In addition, more expensive processors may be targeted at a higher-end market, where consumers are willing to pay more for a product with better performance. \nIt's also important to keep in mind that the price of a processor is just one factor to consider when building a PC.

      "Shooting a gun into the air is very dangerous and should never be done. When a bullet is fired from a gun, it travels very fast and has a lot of energy. This energy can cause the bullet to travel long distances, even miles, before it comes back down to the ground. When the bullet comes back down, it can still have a lot of energy and can cause serious injury or death if it hits someone. \nImagine you throw a rock up into the air. It goes up, up, up and then comes back down. When it comes back down, it might not hit you, but it could still hurt if it lands on your foot. A bullet is like a very fast and heavy rock that can travel much farther than a rock and has the potential to cause much more damage. \nShooting a gun into the air is not only dangerous for the person who is shot, but also for anyone else who might be nearby. Even if the bullet does not hit anyone directly, it can still cause harm if it lands on a hard surface and breaks into pieces, or if it hits something else and bounces off in a different direction. \nIn short, shooting a gun into the air is very dangerous and should never be done.

There was one college study that found roughly half of the women had ravishment fantasies . Why ? Because in general it is a way to avoid any guilt . Women are raised with lots of conflicting sexual messages . Be sexy , but do n't be a slut ! Wait until marriage , but if you say no to a man , you are a frigid bitch . There is lots of attention to male sexuality , but very little to female sexuality ( at least not women owned female sexuality ) .

Additionally , there are many women with a very low self esteem .

Because of that , these states change who they vote for from election to election - not because their citizens change parties , but because when 10 % fewer liberals vote than usual that electorate swings conservative . It 's a caustic problem that has lead to parties crafting policy to energize their bases , rather than trying to appeal to Americans as a whole . It 's one of the main reasons America sorely needs electoral reform .",
      "Many states have a heavy bias towards one side or the other in an election . It 's unlikely for them to switch away from this bias , and even if they did that would only happen in a landslide election so it would n't really be important . Other states are simply not worth that many electoral college votes so winning them is n't in and of itself that important . Some states though ( Ohio , Florida , and Pennsylvania are the traditional 3 , but Virginia , Colorado , and a few others are sometimes included ) are large enough to be a big prize , and near enough to the center politically that they are open for either side to win . Winning the majority of these states will general mean you have won enough states to win the election ( because it 's presumed you won all the \" easy \" states if you also won the moderately difficult ones ) .",
      "Most states have demographics that are pretty set . It 's quite unlikely for Utah or Idaho to vote Democratic or for California or Vermont to vote Republican . But some states are mixed or balanced demographics ... Florida is sort o a redneck state , except there 's a huge number of immigrants and retired people there who would vote Democrat , and its worth a lot of points . Ohio is another one , were the demographics just do n't lean one way or another . So whoever they vote for is very likely a good sample of how the populace as a whole is going to vote ."

      "A swing state is a state that does not consistently vote for the same political party in presidential elections. These states are considered important because the outcome of the election can be influenced by the results in these states. \nThere are a few reasons why certain states are typically swing states. One reason is that the population of these states is evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, so the outcome of the election in these states is often very close. \nAnother reason is that these states have a large number of electoral votes, which are used to determine the winner of the presidential election. The more electoral votes a state has, the more influence it has on the outcome of the election. \nFinally, swing states are often targeted by both political parties because they can be won over with targeted campaign efforts. This means that both parties will spend a lot of time and resources trying to get people in these states to vote for their candidate.",

      "The \"enter\" key on a computer keyboard is also sometimes called the \"return\" key because it is used to tell the computer to perform an action or \"return\" a result. \nImagine you are using a calculator to do some math. When you have finished entering the numbers and symbols you need, you press the \"enter\" or \"return\" key to tell the calculator to perform the calculations and show you the answer. The enter key is like a signal to the computer or calculator that you are finished entering information and are ready for it to do something with that information. \nSimilarly, when you are typing a message or filling out a form on a computer, you can use the enter key to tell the computer that you have finished typing and are ready to send the message or submit the form. \nSo, even though the enter key doesn't actually move you physically to a different place or bring something back to you, it is still called the \"return\" key because it is used to tell the computer to do something and \"return\" a result.

    "generated_answer": [
      "An electric well is a type of well that uses an electric pump to bring water up from underground and into your home. When you use water from an electric well, the pump turns on and sends water through a pipe and into your home. If you try to use water from an electric well when there is no power, the pump will not be able to turn on and the water will not be able to flow. This means that you will not be able to use any water from the well until the power comes back on. \nIf you try to use water from an electric well when there is no power, it could cause damage to the pressure tank. The pressure tank is a large container that holds water under pressure. When you turn on a faucet or use water in any way, the pressure in the tank decreases. When the pressure in the tank gets low enough, the pump turns on and adds more water to the tank to bring the pressure back up. If you try to use water from an electric well when there is no power, the pump will not be able to turn on and the pressure in the tank will not be able to stay high enough. This can cause the tank to become damaged or even burst, which could cause water to leak out and cause damage to your home. \nIn summary, if you try to use water from an electric well when there is no power, it will not be able to flow and it could cause damage to the pressure tank. It is important to make sure that the power is on before you try to use water from an electric well.",

      "1 . The economy does n't work like that . There are n't a lot of jobs in a lot of places . Unemployment may be back to relatively close to pre-2007 but the jobs that have been coming back have been created have overwhelmingly been low wage jobs . Throw onto that the fact that they put many small businesses out of business since they ca n't compete with the prices at Walmart , and Walmart can only sell at those prices by paying poverty wages at nearly every level of their operation . 2 . Why not ? Somebody has to stand up to Walmart , and politicians wo n't . All Walmart cares about is making money , and they do n't make money if workers do n't work . They are using collective action to make Walmart listen and respect their right to form a union . Walmart pretty much by policy violates labor laws every day by firing pro - union workers , telling employees not to talk about how much they make , and even making people work off the clock . 3 . Service work us the new bedrock of our economy . You ca n't outsource it . It 's here to stay . We can decide to make those jobs good middle class jobs . You probably think of jobs in manufacturing as solid middle class jobs . Well , until workers in the 20s and 30s started striking in the steel mills , paper mills , etc . , those jobs were the worst , most dangerous , lowest paying jobs around . But those workers fought to form unions , make their voices heaed , and made a whole new class of middle class jobs that led to the great expansion of the middle class in the 50s and 60s . We have the opportunity to make that choice now . And right now , wealth inequality is at levels we have n't seen since 1929 , so it seems like as good a time as ever .",
      "There are Walmart strikes every single year at Christmas time . Walmart employs 1.4 million people in the US alone . If 99 % were happy , and 1 % of the employees were unhappy that is 14,000 unhappy workers . When 14,000 people do something , or are threatening to do something , it gets national attention .

It's possible that you may be misunderstanding the situation or that there is misinformation being circulated. \nIn general, people go on strike when they are unhappy with their working conditions or pay, and they want to try to negotiate for better treatment. They do this by refusing to work until their demands are met. Going on strike is a way for workers to try to get their employer to listen to their concerns and make changes. \nSometimes, people may decide to quit their job and find another one if they are unhappy with their current employer. However, this is not always a feasible option, especially if the person is in a financial or personal situation where they are unable to leave their job.

When you stretch the joint capsule, tiny pockets of air or gas can become trapped in the synovial fluid.

    "question": "how does a nuclear reactor work ? Including how it starts up and maintains stability to how its energy get stored . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "The most popular type uses the heat from radioactive decay to heat water and push the steam through turbines that spin and produce the power . \" Starting up \" a reactor means removing enough of the control rods ( radiation absorbers ) that the fuel gets hot and boils water to steam . Maintaining a stable reaction requires inserting or removing fuel or control rods so the temperature and reactions stay within defined ranges . For extra security , a huge pool of water is generally over the rods to absorb errant radiation and cool the rods should trouble arise . Storing the energy does not happen . It 's being created so it can be used nearly immediately . The energy that was stored came in the form of Uranium and other elements forged in the bellies of supernovae billions of years ago and trillions of miles away from us . Tl;dr : We boil water with chunks of solid stars .",
      "First , understand that nearly all electric generation is steam moving a turbine on a generator which creates electricity to transmission along lines or storage in ( capacitors and batteries ) so , nuclear power is used to create heat , to make steam to turn a turbine and make electricity . The Nuclear part is a set of radioactive and nonradioactive rods ( in 1970s technology ) which when set in an array get hot through the reaction , to heat water to make steam to turn a turbine . The rods are set up so as to be raised or lowered to intensify or reduce those reactions , along with insulating material to control the rate of those radioactive reactions and to control the heat created . ( that 's eli5 , with all sorts of near correct info ) .",
      "Many of these answers are not 100 % correct . The internal fuel portion of a nuclear reactor is uranium dioxide , enriched approximately 3 - 4 % , and contained in a fuel rod , which is a part of a fuel assembly containing typically 90 - 120 rods . A fuel cell contains 4 fuel assemblies , which are permanently in place unless a refuel cycle is occurring . The control rod , which contains neutron absorbing elements such as Boron or Hafnium , are moved in and out of the fuel cell to control the number of reactions occurring at any given time . Neutrons love Boron and Hafnium , even more than U-235 - which is why the control rods are made of such elements . It is the free neutrons that produce the nuclear reactions , not the protons . The two common reactor types are boiling water reactor and pressurized water reactor . At a PWR , the water does not boil . The water is kept at such a high pressure that boiling is prohibited and the heat generated by the fuel burn is transferred to a secondary volume thru a steam generator , which boils and turns your turbine . BWRs send water up thru the fuel assemblies , removing the heat generated , boiling and converting to steam by the exit of the top of the fuel assembly . The wet steam goes thru a moisture separator and dryer and off to spin the turbine and make electricity . Nuke plants are very stable once they 're operating . Typically a plant will stay online continuously for 18 - 24 months depending on type of fuel used . A plant maintains operations for so long without refuel by beginning the cycle with a good portion of the control rods only halfway out . Over a couple months , a few rods will be pulled out just a bit , uncovering more of the fuel . The huge pool of water over the fuel mentioned would by the spent fuel pool that is adjacent to the reactor . Any other questions , let me know . Source : Senior Reactor Operator at BWR in SE USA"
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "Sure! A nuclear reactor is a machine that uses nuclear reactions to generate heat, which is then used to produce electricity. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works: \n1. Inside the reactor, there are fuel rods made of a special type of metal called uranium. These fuel rods contain tiny particles called atoms. \n2. When an atom is hit by a neutron (a small particle found in the nucleus of an atom), it can split into two smaller atoms, called fission. This releases a lot of energy in the form of heat. \n3. To start the reactor, the fuel rods are placed inside the reactor and the atoms are hit with neutrons to start the fission process. This heat is used to turn water into steam, which is used to spin a turbine. The turbine is connected to a generator, which produces electricity. \n4. To maintain stability, the reactor has control rods that can be inserted into the reactor to absorb excess neutrons and slow down the fission process. This helps to control the amount of heat being produced and keeps the reactor running safely. \n5. The electricity produced by the reactor is stored in a power grid and can be used to power homes and businesses. \nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.",

Some may have been attracted to the group's ideology, which promotes a very strict and narrow interpretation of Islam. Others may have been seeking a sense of purpose or belonging, or may have been influenced by friends or family members who were already involved with the group. \nIt's important to remember that joining a violent extremist group like ISIS is never a good idea.

      "When there is an oil spill, it can be tempting to try to burn the oil because it might seem like an easy way to get rid of the oil and the mess it causes. However, there are a few reasons why burning the oil is not a good solution: \n1. Burning the oil creates air pollution. When the oil is burned, it releases harmful chemicals into the air. These chemicals can be harmful to people, animals, and the environment. \n2. Burning the oil can spread the spill. When the oil is burned, the fire can cause the oil to spread to other areas, which can make the problem even worse. \n3. Burning the oil can cause damage to the environment. The heat from the fire can damage plants and animals in the area, and the smoke from the fire can also harm these living things. \nInstead of burning the oil, it is usually better to try to clean up the spill and remove the oil from the environment. This can be done in a number of ways, such as using special chemicals to break down the oil, using booms to contain the oil, and using absorbent materials to soak up the oil. Cleaning up an oil spill is a big deal because it is important to protect the environment and the living things that depend on it.",

      "The death penalty, also known as capital punishment, is considered by some to be the worst punishment because it involves taking the life of a person as punishment for a crime.

Other people believe that the death penalty is necessary to protect society and to deter others from committing serious crimes. \nTo be forced to live the rest of your life in jail, also known as a life sentence, can also be a very severe punishment. It means that you will spend the rest of your life in prison, separated from your family and friends, and with very few freedoms.

    "human_answer": [
      "URL_0 > The letters of a word are separated by a space equal to three dots ( one dash ) , and the words are separated by a space equal to seven dots .",
      "Piggy - backing on this question , can you really send Morse with just some kind of percussive sound ? You see in movies people trapped will rap out SOS by just banging on something and I can see how that will work , just because it 's such a familiar pattern . The thing is that the bang only gives you the start of a dot or a dash so how can you tell which is which . It would be very difficult to tell the difference between a word ending with \" e \" and a word ending with \" t \" . It seems to me that reading arbitrary messages in Morse with just a banging noise would be very difficult with ambiguity and guesswork everywhere . I know the original telegraph operators discovered that they could hear the letters just from the clicking mechanism but those devices made different clicks to start and stop each dot or dash . I learned Morse myself long ago ( for my amateur radio licence ) but was too slow reading to pass the test ( had to take a limited licence ) . My guess is that the movies are about as accurate in this respect as they are in most other technical areas ; not very . In case the other explanations of OP 's question are not clear enough ... Morse is sent by turning your transmitter on and off rapidly . Depending on how fast you want to send , choose one standard unit of time . Then : * transmitting for one unit is a dot * transmitting for three units is a dash * silence for one unit is separates dots and dashes within a letter * silence for three units separates letters * silence for seven units separates words The transmitter does n't actually send a beeping tone ; it 's just full on or full off . The receiver generates the audible tone , essentially based on how far the tuner is off the transmitting frequency . If you 're 1kHz off you 'll hear a 1kHz tone . If there are multiple transmitters close to the same frequency then you might be able to hear them all and have to distinguish them with your ear . And finally , thinking of the letters as sequences of dots and dashes is bad . Memorising them by writing down symbols on paper is a waste of time . You have to practice by listening to each letter 's rhythm and learning those .",
      "Ham radio operator here . There is a standard for the amount of space between letters , and between words . It is slightly longer than the space between the dot and dash elements that make up letters and punctuation marks . Someone who sends really beautiful code sends these elements precisely and accurately , making it easier for listeners to pick up where letters and words end . \" The time taken to produce the sound equivalent to one ' di ' or ' dit ' ( dot ) is taken as unit time and called a dot unit . A ' dah ' is approximately of three dot units length and the space between two sound elements of a letter is one dot unit , i.e. silence period is one dot unit . The space between two letters or characters is equal to three dot units . The space between two words is equal to five dot units . \" From here : URL_0 And by the way , in the United States , Morse code is no longer required in order to earn a ham radio license .

    "human_answer": [
      "So here 's the thing - The Sherman was not really that inferior . This is a myth based on a misinterpretation of history . It was a strong tank , with a reasonable gun and was easy to produce and maintain . Its gun was a little under - powered against late war German tanks but those tanks were rare , and the Sherman 's outnumbered them dramatically . Historians have done extensive analysis of all the tank engagements in World War II and they uncovered one constant truth - * The side that fired first won an overwhelming amount of the time * . It was n't skill , or equipment that decided battles ... it was typically \" who got to shoot first \" . Now consider the situation of World War II where the Sherman actually encountered things like Tigers and Panthers . Let 's set the stage - The Allies are in the attacking role for most of the post D - Day events . They are advancing against the Germans , with the Sherman 's often leading the charge . Arrayed against them are the Germans fighting a primarily defense war . They know the Allies are coming and from where so they have time to set up positions . With the powerful German guns this often means getting highly effective first shots on the advancing Shermans . As a visual example - Watch the \" Tiger \" scene in the movie Fury . The Tiger 's first shot is from cover and is an ambush . From there the Shermans are fighting a Tiger in a battle that the Tiger picked to give it the best shot of victory .",
      "Because those tanks were the best that they had available .",
      "The Sherman was not meant to fight other tanks . It was meant primarily to support infantry formations and destroy enemy fortifications . US armor theory had tank formations primarily used in defeating enemy positions , while rapid and mobile tank destroyer units were meant to engage enemy armor . These units initially had heavy anti tank cannons pulled by trucks , but moved to vehicles like the M10 and M18 . They had light armor , were open top , but fast and had a heavy gun . Obviously in combat the plans often just did not work out and Sherman 's had to engage enemy armor , though more often it was in the form of Pz IV 's and the various German tank destroyer lines , which with the gun upgrades they had installed by the invasion of France the Sherman stood a good chance against ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "During World War II, the United States used Sherman tanks because they were relatively cheap and easy to produce in large numbers. The United States was a large and industrial country, and it was able to produce a lot of tanks and other military equipment to support the Allied war effort. \nSherman tanks were not necessarily \"inferior\" to German tanks like the Tiger. While the Tiger was certainly a formidable tank, it was also expensive and time-consuming to produce, which meant that the Germans could not build as many of them as the Americans could build Shermans. In addition, the Sherman tank had some strengths that made it useful in certain situations. For example, it was faster and more maneuverable than the Tiger, which made it better suited for some types of warfare. \nOverall, the use of Sherman tanks by the Americans was a matter of practicality and strategy. The United States needed a large number of tanks that it could produce quickly and inexpensively, and the Sherman tank fit the bill. While it may not have been the most powerful tank on the battlefield, it played a crucial role in the Allied victory in World War II.",

When I have white paint red , blue and yellow are reflected . Now here is where it gets different . When I take 2 lamps of different colours and point then at the same spot , the colours get added . So let 's say you get red and blue lamps . Turn then on and you get all the red colours and all the blue colours resulting in a nice purple colour . But now we take paint . When you shine white light shining on red paint , the reflection throws away all other colours , but red . The same with blue paint throwing away everything but blue . So we got our paint and we 're ready to mix red and blue . The red paint wants to throw away the blue colour and the blue wants to throw away the red . Problem ? A bit . There are many shades of red and blue , and some of those shades are a bit alike . A blue - ish red and a red - ish blue are the shades that can still reflect . So our paint mix reflects a blue - ish red / red - ish blue light , but why is it darker , brown - ish and not pretty purple ? Well , we threw away a lot of shades of red and blue leaving not a lot of light to reflect of the paint to reach your eyes . TL;DR Lights add shades of colours to create a new colour spanning a broad colour spectrum . Paint subtracts shades leaving a narrow colour spectrum .",
      "When colors mix , what you 're really seeing is what wavelengths ( colors ) of light are hitting your eye . If they all hit your eye , you see white . or you could get just a red wavelength , or just a blue , or just a green . If you see no light , you see black Paint absorbs light . So if you shine a white light on white paint , it absorbs nothing and sends all the light to your eyes , so you see every wavelength and see white . If you Shine a white light on black paint , the black paint absorbs all the colors , so you get no light in your eye . If you shine a while light on green paint , it absorbs everything but green light , so your eye sees green light . Now the complex part is when you combine them . When you combine lights , your eyes are getting more and more light , so you 're getting closer to white . But when you combine paints and then shine white light on them , the more paint you combine means the more light is absorbed by the paint , so the less light actually reaches your eye , so you get closer to black . Basically , when dealing with lights you 're dealing with what colors actually reach your eye . When dealing with paints , you 're dealing with what colors DONT reach your eye , so to figure out what DOES reach your eye , you do the opposite . URL_1 vs URL_0"

      "In many religions and belief systems, Satan is considered to be a malevolent being who represents evil and tempts people to do wrong. There are many different names and titles that have been given to Satan over the years, and these names can have different meanings or connotations depending on the context in which they are used. \nFor example, the name \"Satan\" is derived from a Hebrew word that means \"adversary\" or \"opponent,\" and it is often used to refer to the ultimate embodiment of evil in Abrahamic religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. \nThe name \"Devil\" is another word that is often used to refer to Satan, and it comes from the Greek word \"diabolos,\" which means \"slanderer\" or \"accuser.\" In many traditions, the Devil is depicted as a tempter who tries to lead people astray and convince them to do evil things. \nOther names for Satan include \"Baphomet,\" which is a name that has been associated with Satanism and the occult; \"Beelzebub,\" which is a name that appears in the Hebrew Bible as a name for a demon; and \"Belphagor,\" which is a name that has been used in some legends and myths to refer to a demon or malevolent spirit. \nIt's important to note that these names and titles are often used symbolically or metaphorically, and they may not necessarily represent specific beings or entities.

    "generated_answer": [
      "Water can conduct electricity because it contains ions, which are atoms that have gained or lost electrons and have a positive or negative charge. When water contains a lot of dissolved minerals, it can conduct electricity because the ions in the minerals allow electricity to flow through the water. \nHowever, pure water does not conduct electricity very well because it does not have many ions. This is because the hydrogen atoms in water are bonded to the oxygen atoms through covalent bonds, which do not allow electrons to flow freely. As a result, pure water is a very poor conductor of electricity. \nSo, when you touched a slightly damp iPad charger, the water on your skin may have conducted electricity, which is why you got a bit of a jolt.

    "question": "Why do people like alcohol ? I am going to college next year and I know that there will be parties all that , but I just do n't get . Especially something like shots etc . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "There are many different reasons to enjoy alcohol . In moderate doses , it makes you feel more relaxed , it may have some health benefits , it enhances the taste of food ( the right wine pairing is an excellent complement to a good meal ) , it can taste good on itself , etc . Beer is extremely refreshing in a hot day , and can be warming in a cold day , depending on the type of beer . To young people , it is attractive because it can make you feel happier , more confident , and take more risks . This is particularly attractive if you are just learning how to behave socially , need to make friends in a strange place , would like to start dating , need to relieve stress - all common situations in college , especially for freshmen . But I think that there is a distortion , in particular in the US . Alcohol in college becomes more important than it should be because for most of the kids , it has been such a taboo most of their lives . College is the first time that you may find yourself without close supervision and surrounded by people your age who have access to alcohol . Then you turn 21 and suddenly you can legally have the stuff . As a result , most Americans are completely unprepared for this , when the time comes . They do n't know what they like , they do n't know what their limits are , they do n't know how their bodies will react , and they have to deal with peer pressure telling them that drinking is required and that being wasted is desirable fro some reason . Finally , there is a small percentage of the population who are vulnerable to alcohol addiction , which is something that you really do n't want in your life . It 's like most other addictions , except that it is very visible , very public , and very hard to escape . For all these reasons , my suggestion is simply , be careful . Do n't let yourself get carried away . Put a very small limit on yourself . Go to a party , for instance , with the firm limit of 1 beer . No matter how you feel then , do n't push that limit . After you go home and it wears off , think about it and see if it would be wise to raise your limit next time . No matter who you are , though , more then 4 or 5 beers in one event are a bad sign . Stay away from hard liquors as much as you can . If / when you are ready to try , make sure you do it with a group of friends , and that at least one of you is going to be sober . You will eventually get a hangover , inevitably . Remember that if you feel bad , it 's for a reason - you probably pushed your body more than it was able to go . Finally , remember that in large quantities alcohol can kill . Every year there are reports of kids killing themselves in colleges , by drinking too much and not knowing how to deal with it . As a parent , this is one of my biggest fears . So know that it is not normal for someone to drink so much that they pass out . If this happens to someone around you , be a true friend and try to stop them . If you ca n't and they do pass out , try to wake them up . Take them home , give them a shower , have them drink some coffee . They can sleep after they feel better . Most important , if someone has been drinking a lot , passes out , and you ca n't wake them up , please , please call 911 or take them to a hospital . Yes , there will be consequences , but any consequence is better than your friend dying because no one was responsible enough , brave enough to get them help when they need it . be safe .",

The big exception to this is beer , i just like it . I drink it because there are amazing tasting beers out there .",
      "As a former substance abuse counselor I will say most of these answers are spot on and do n't need to be said again However , I wonder if your question is n't really ' why do people like the taste of alcohol ? ' If that 's the case , then the answer is simple enough . Alcohol is an acquired taste ( much like coffee is ) . We have to force ourselves to like it . Even so , some people ( even alcoholics ) go their while lives drinking and can never stand the taste of it . They do so because of the way it makes them feel . It is mostly because of this people create mixed drinks ( e.g. long island iced tea , etc ) , to keep the alcohol flavor from being strong while still giving the desired effect ."

    "human_answer": [
      "the comprehensive answer is that on the modern battlefield ( ever since WWII ) weapons have been superior to armor . Modern tanks survive on the battlefield against anti - tank weapons by being low to the ground and taking advantage of terrain to stay hidden or at least reduce their exposure . Bipedal tanks would have the problem of not being able to take advantage of terrain for safety , and not being able to take advantage of sloping to improve the effectiveness of the armor thickness they can reasonably carry . The only potential advantage of a bipedal tank would be use in a city where they could use buildings as cover . However , even in this situation infantry with anti - tank weapons would have the greater advantage . Finally , for large gundam or pacific rim sized bipedal tanks the surface pressure under their feet would tear huge furrows in the ground . Making them impractical . However , smaller maybe 1 or 2 ton sized powered armor could be highly effective . Offering better protection from small arms while still being able to use terrain for protection from anti - tank weapons .",
      "We can today make walking robots . But scaling them up causes problems similar to WWII era tanks . T-34 USSR tank a machine with tracks and wheels weighed 26 tons . The only slightly larger German panther was 12 tons heavier . Then it got to ridiculous examples like the Maus , 200 tons but so much internal space was filled with engines it was ineffective . Scaling them up comes with problems like the square cube law . For example , if you double the size ( measured by edge length ) of a cube , its surface area is quadrupled , and its volume is increased by eight times . Add in the maintenance time and costs ( modern tanks are negative where you spend 10 hours for every 1 hour of operation ) considering tanks are nt THAT complex and they are also a logistical nightmare too . Again WWII proved this with the king tiger and the T-34 . The 34 was simple(r ) than the Tigers the tigers spend much of their time being maintained .",

It 's more like unfortunately their lives are just that short and fragile , and swimming up and mating takes up that much energy , that they orgasm ( if they even have those ) and then drop dead from exhaustion after a while . I hear too that the water salinity is different between where they initially live versus where they mate , and that poisons them to death too ; but the waters where they mate offer productive advantages through the production of pheromones . However evolutionarily , well , it gets the job done , and we have salmon babies soon enough .",
      "You know how I finally managed to swim farther than my brother ? I held nothing in for the way back . It would n't make sense if every salmon only had one baby before dying . That would be a huge risk for very little profit . But salmon make a long journey away from the ocean to lay thousands of eggs in the best possible place for their spawn to grow up . They 're basically spending everything they have to spawn a large number of offspring under ideal conditions . In other species the chance to mate is very rare . For example because they live in very extreme environments . Under those circumstances it 's important to make the most of it to make sure the offspring get 's a good start . In some species this means the female will eat the male ( with or without his cooperation ) , it means the female get 's a good meal in a place where food is scarce . Some species simply only need to mate once . Many social insects like bees and ants have a queen that only mates once , this one mating provides her with all the sperm to keep laying eggs for a lifetime . In these species males only have on purpose , impregnate a queen and then they 're completely useless . Often the males in these species are only born during a time when queen 's will take flight and start new colonies . Evolution creates all kinds of unusual arrangements to fit all kinds of unusual circumstances . Angler fish live in a deep , dark , virtual death zone far beneath the ocean 's surface . Under these circumstances it 's so rare for two angler fish to meet that when a tiny male finally meets a female , he bites down on her skin to stay with her . Slowly he grows to be an extension of her body , he get 's his nutrition by being connected to the female 's blood circulation and spends the rest of his life hanging from her body , supplying sperm .

This is called semelparity. \nSemelparity, also known as \"big bang\" reproduction, is a reproductive strategy in which an organism reproduces only once and then dies. This is in contrast to iteroparity, in which an organism reproduces multiple times over the course of its lifetime. \nOne reason why some species may have evolved to reproduce this way is that it can allow them to put all of their energy into producing a large number of offspring at once, rather than spreading their energy out over multiple reproductive events. This can be especially advantageous in environments where conditions are variable and unpredictable, because it allows the organism to take advantage of good conditions when they occur. \nFor example, salmon reproduce in streams and rivers, and the conditions in these habitats can vary significantly from year to year. By reproducing all at once and then dying, salmon can ensure that their offspring will have a good chance of surviving and reproducing, even if conditions become unfavorable in the future. \nOverall, semelparity may not always be the most advantageous reproductive strategy, but it can be beneficial in certain situations.",

      "Paper toilet seat covers, also known as \"ass gaskets,\" are thin sheets of paper that are placed on top of the toilet seat in a public restroom. The idea behind using these covers is that they can provide a barrier between your skin and the surface of the toilet seat, which may be contaminated with germs or bacteria. Some people believe that using a paper seat cover can help reduce the risk of getting a urinary tract infection (UTI) or other illness from coming into contact with germs on the toilet seat. \nHowever, the effectiveness of paper toilet seat covers as a way to prevent illness is controversial. Some experts believe that paper seat covers may actually be less effective at preventing the spread of germs than simply wiping down the toilet seat with a disinfectant. This is because paper seat covers are often thin and may not provide a complete barrier between your skin and the toilet seat. In addition, paper seat covers can be easily torn or punctured, which could allow germs to come into contact with your skin. \nOverall, it is important to practice good hygiene when using public restrooms, regardless of whether you use a paper toilet seat cover or not. This includes washing your hands thoroughly with soap and water before and after using the bathroom, and avoiding touching your face or other areas of your body while in the bathroom.",

      "There are a few reasons why medical care is generally more expensive in the US than dental care. One reason is that medical care is typically more complex and requires more specialized training and equipment. For example, a surgeon needs to have a lot of education and experience, and they also need to use expensive equipment like MRI machines and operating theaters. This can drive up the cost of medical procedures. \nAnother reason is that there is less competition in the medical field compared to the dental field. There are fewer hospitals and medical centers, and they often have more bargaining power when it comes to setting prices. In contrast, there are many more dentists and dental practices, which can create more competition and drive down prices. \nFinally, there are also different insurance policies and payment systems for medical care and dental care. Medical insurance is often more expensive and covers a wider range of procedures, while dental insurance is usually cheaper and covers a more limited range of procedures. This can also contribute to the difference in prices between medical care and dental care.",

      "Radiation can be harmful, but it can also be used to treat certain medical conditions. When used in the right way, radiation can help kill cancer cells or shrink tumors. It can also be used to treat other conditions, like an overactive thyroid gland or certain types of blood disorders. \nRadiation works by damaging the DNA inside cells. This makes it hard for the cells to grow and divide, which can help kill cancer cells or shrink tumors. Normal cells can also be damaged by radiation, but they are usually able to repair themselves. Cancer cells, on the other hand, may not be able to repair themselves as well, which is why radiation can be effective at killing them. \nWhen doctors use radiation to treat someone, they carefully plan the treatment to make sure that the right amount of radiation is used in the right place. They also try to protect normal cells as much as possible to minimize side effects. Even with these precautions, side effects can still happen, and that's why radiation is usually only used when the benefits outweigh the risks.",

But they would not have such issues with their grandchildren , your grandparents . And you and your grandparents also communicate just fine . Old English and Modern English are n't exactly the same language , but Old English morphed into Modern English slowly . All down through this period of time , every generation complained that their grandchildren did n't speak \" proper English \" , but there was never a point where they could n't communicate : there was n't a definite break somewhere , where one generation was speaking Old English and their children were speaking Middle English so they could n't understand each other . We like to put neat labels on things , and that works well most of the time ; but in the real world , things do n't fall neatly into specific categories . We say that two methods of communicating are different languages if they are mutually unintelligible , but the reality is much more complicated : what we really have is a lot of different continuums , and we just decide to draw lines and say , \" This side is Dutch , and that side is German \" , for example . But listen to some of the dialects of German spoken near the Dutch border and some of the dialects of Dutch spoken near the German border , and they 're actually very similar . So , regarding English , what has happened is that the language that was being spoken in the year 800 slowly changed from generation to generation , eventually becoming the language that is being spoken today . The nearest thing we have to a definite boundary is the year 1066 , when the Normans invaded , introducing quite a lot of Norman French vocabulary and grammar to the English language , but even that did n't happen overnight : it took a couple of generations , during which the Anglo - Saxons picked up some words from their Norman lords and masters , while the Normans gradually came to use the English language . But other than that , it 's sort of still the same language ( in that Modern English is a direct descendent of Old English ) , but at the same time it is n't ( because , as you rightly point out , Modern English and Old English are mutually unintelligible ) .",

    "human_answer": [
      "In every language I know , the swears are either religion - based , family / ancestry - based , or based on private body functions . It would not work to make - up random words and say \" ok , these are offensive now \" . Religion and body - functions work because you are taking something very private , personal , and essential to a person and figuratively throwing it in the gutter . In other words , the context of the curse is important . \" Jesus \" or \" fuck \" are offensive when used as a curse specifically because they also sacred or special .",
      "I actually did a brief research project on the history of english swearing . The Romans are the ones who globalized the idea of \" swears \" or reserved , inappropriate language . The latin ' profanus ' , from which ' profane ' derives , literally meant ' outside of the temple ' - Romans would shoot their mouths off before entering the sacred space . In english - speaking societies , it was understood by the Latin speaking clergy that certain words were unfit for print in official church records - and yet mixed Latin - English versions of curses still made it into a few . For most everyone else , they cursed often and there was n't nearly as much of a fuss about it . \" Fuck \" only referred to the act of copulation , and \" cunt \" was used strictly to refer to the labia or vagina . This is n't to say that this language was n't considered harsh or offensive , but that it was spoken frequently enough in an indicative context that reduces the likelihood of the existence of any social taboo surrounding the acts or the words . Similarly , before public sanitation takes off , there is nothing profane or insulting about mentioning someone else 's defecation or urination - it 's just \" shit . \" And it 's everywhere . The very beginning of the conception of swears we see today starts around the invention of the printing press . We know from Chaucer - the most highly reputed English author pre - printing press , whose works were some of the first to be widely printed - that cursing was common , as his novels commonly provided realistic ( read : explicit ) dialogue between characters from different parts of England . As the craft of writing develops in the early Enlightenment we start to see far more euphemism , dirty word play , double entendre , and similar devices ( \" making the beast with two backs \" ) to allude to these topics more lightly . By Shakespeare 's time , there is definitely social taboo surrounding these curses , as none are explicitly mentioned in any of his plays . An important note : At this point these words are considered inappropriate - but they are not yet insults . If you called someone a \" fuck \" in the 1600s in England - they would have no idea how to interpret that other than your body language and tone . More on this later . Continuing from Shakespeare - English writing becomes more and more prudish in its choice of words through the Victorian Era . Some new , creative applications of old swears start to appear - \" fucked \" or \" getting fucked \" gets the meaning of \" being taken advantage of \" in the 1700s for the first time . Overall , the taboo of these phrases only increases in polite & distinguished society , though elsewhere people probably cursed as much as always . The next turning point is the Industrial Revolution . Here cursing starts to really take off - popular swears begin to take on different parts of speech and they start being used as direct insults rather than just chatter about inappropriate contexts ( \" You fucking fuck ! \" ) . Fast forward to the world wars , and swearing has become the most popular thing on the planet . Basically creative measures of cursing explode to the point that we start losing track of them all - \" bullshit \" was Australian or New Zealand soldiers making fun of the British for their keen intent on shining or \" bulling \" their boots . Other compound curses - \" motherfucker , clusterfuck , etc . \" appear around this time of bloodshed and frustration with nationalist governments . Basically these wars are responsible for the \" is my child or my boss around ? no ? well fuck this then \" attitude , and the multitude of curses we can draw from . Is cursing still taboo ? To an extent ... it 's just that our instantaneous communication makes it so that you see it a lot more than you would , and makes it less shocking . Also , cursing does increase your pain tolerance , and there is some interesting information about aphasia ( loss of speech ) and cursing . Patients who have brain injuries that leave them unable to speak , find it easiest to start speaking again through cursing . This and other evidence that curses are linked with the emotional centers of the brain more so than other words suggests that profanity has a lasting purpose in our society - to reduce stress and pain . There are studies that go into Tourette 's and aphasia more to figure out what the neurobiological triggers of cursing are and what it can tell us about our behavioral predispositions . TLDR : ... - 1400 ~ cursing is understood as disrespect to the gods ( or god ) , people curse a lot 1400 - 1600 ~ more educated elements of society start using euphemism , cursing slows 1600 - 1850 ~ growing middle classes begin to take up the taboos of the wealthy , cursing slows more , though creativity and number of curses grows 1850 - present ~ everyone curses however the fuck they want to and most people do n't give a shit",

Kankerzoot ( I think ) is one of the worst things you can say . You 'd say like like we say \" fuck ! \" when something bad happens . I think the French use some kind of religious based thing . Anyway , English was a Germanic language at one point , then England was invaded by people who spoke a Latin language . Once that happened the language of the royalty and high society was this Latin language because they were the conquerors and now ruled everything . Over time these two languages began to blend together but we still had two words for most things ; one Germanic , and one Latin . For example we have vagina ( a Latin word ) and cunt ( a Germanic word ) . The Germanic word is the bad one , essentially because using the Germanic word meant you were uneducated and lower class . Do this for long enough , boom : English swear words . Hopefully that 's an a good ELI5 answer . If you want to know who invaded and when , Google is your friend here or maybe go ask /r / history .

      "Swear words, also known as profanity or obscenities, are words that are considered offensive or taboo because they are generally considered to be rude, vulgar, or insulting. The origins of swear words can be traced back to the earliest human societies, where certain words and phrases were used to express strong emotions or to convey disrespect or aggression. \nOne theory is that swear words originally evolved as a way for people to vent their anger or frustration without physically harming others. Swearing may have also served as a way to bond with others and build solidarity, as people who swore together may have been seen as belonging to the same social group. \nOver time, certain words and phrases came to be considered inappropriate or offensive in many cultures and societies, and using them in public or in polite conversation became taboo. In some cases, this may be due to the words being associated with particular groups or activities that are considered taboo or shameful. In other cases, the taboo nature of certain words may simply be due to their association with strong emotions or with disrespectful or aggressive behavior. \nIn general, it is considered rude to use swear words in public or in polite conversation because they can be offensive or disturbing to others, and because they can reflect poorly on the person using them. However, there is often a great deal of cultural and personal variation in what is considered to be a swear word, and what is considered acceptable language.",

Stars burn out , buildings crumble , organisms die , and molecules break apart . You can fight against it ( new stars can form , buildings can be repaired , organisms reproduce , chemical reactions can create new molecules ) but eventually given enough time , everything will come apart .",
      "Yikes .. the amount of misinformation here . Yeah the whole idea of everything moving towards disorder and decay is very poetic and somewhat based in a scientific principle , but firstly that 's the 2nd law of thermodynamics , not a definition of entropy , and secondly I 'm pretty sure a junior engineering student is aware of that simplification and looking for something a little more scientifically rigorous . Disorder is one definition , but a somewhat ambiguous and debated term these days . It makes it easy to grasp at first , but as you learn more can lead to some confusion and the kinds of misinformation I 'm seeing here . Granted I 'm no expert either , but here 's my take : Entropy you can consider a sort of measure of how easily or impossibly reversible a process is . For a more tangible example : an object falling from a higher place to a low place is a relatively small change of entropy . Assuming the system as simply the object , you need to input energy into the system ( pick it up ) to restore it to it 's old state but that 's pretty easy . Let 's say the object cracks during the fall . Well the change in entropy just got a little higher because you got ta do some more work ( input more energy ) to mend that crack . Now say the object shatters into a hundred pieces , it will be even harder to restore it . You 'll have to work to pick up all the pieces , rearrange them back to their original state , and then somehow bind them back together . Thus that 's a much higher change of entropy . And so on .. In physics this concept is important because things naturally want to go to a state of higher entropy ( 2nd law thermodynamics ) , enough so that it can happen spontaneously without outside input . This is what drives so many things , like heat flowing for hot areas to cold areas or pressure gradients in a system tending to equalize or dispersal of particles . Entropy is how you describe that change . In a closed system , if ice melts in water , the ice got warmer but the water got colder , and the total heat / energy in the system is the same ( ignoring heat of fusion ) . In a closed system , if a bunch of grouped together particles dissipate and spread out , the overall mass / density of that system is still the same . So what changed ? And that 's where the concept of entropy comes in as a measure of that change . Um , so that 's more the classical definition . The concept has evolved beyond just physics and I think the definition then really depends on the application .",

In this case, the jar has low entropy because everything is very organized and there is little uncertainty about where the marbles are. \nNow imagine that you shake the jar up, so that the marbles are mixed together. Now it is difficult to predict where any individual marble will be when you reach into the jar. In this case, the jar has high entropy because there is a lot of randomness and uncertainty about where the marbles are. \nIn thermodynamics, entropy is often used to describe the randomness or disorder of a system at the molecular level. For example, when a gas is allowed to expand, the molecules will spread out and become more disordered, resulting in an increase in entropy. Similarly, when a substance is cooled, the molecules will slow down and become more organized, resulting in a decrease in entropy. \nI hope this helps to give you a basic understanding of entropy! Let me know if you have any more questions.",

    "question": "How does radioactivity work If radioactivity is a decaying atom . What is left behind at sites like chernobyl . What causes some atoms or isotopes of atoms to be radioactive while others are not ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Some atoms are just unstable and will eventually break apart . Imagine them like a bunch of legos chained together and being spun . Some configurations will allow a little piece to go flying off while others will stay together . At Chernobyl , Uranium atoms were being split in half in the nuclear reactors . When uranium splits in half , the two smaller atoms that remain ( each being about half the size of U ) are typically unstable ( they have too many neutrons ) . So they convert neutrons to protons in what we call * beta decay . * This happens slowly and releases some energy as it goes . That energy can cause biological damage and is therefore dangerous ( especially if ingested ) .",
      "Radioactivity is usually caused by an unstable nucleus . This is caused when the nuclei are very large ( ie Uranium , Plutonium , etc . ) or if they are poorly assembled with an unstable construction with excessive or lacking neutrons ( Potassium 40 ) . When an atom decays it separates into two particles , a ( often ) hydrogen nucleus and another element slightly smaller . Chernobyl hosts a lot of strontium and cesium which are the products of a nuclear reaction . This is different from a decay scheme . Large elements like Uranium and Plutonium split into large chunks like cesium and strontium . Those are the materials that make sites like Fukushima or Chernobyl .",
      "Basically , what happens is that certain elements are unstable , and to increase stability , they release particles and energy , known as radioactivity . This happens because there are too many particles in the atom for it to be stable . It 's lke a crowded elevator . Since there are so many people , everyone is uncomfortable , and some people will just leave the group instead of sticking together to go all the way to the top . Eventually enough people will leave , and the elevator will be comfortable again . This is how lead is formed ; it 's uranium that has released enough particles to make it ' stable ' , or comfortable enough for the particles to stay together without losing any more ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "Radioactivity is the process by which an atom becomes unstable and releases energy as it decays into a more stable form. This happens because the nucleus of the atom, which is made up of protons and neutrons, is not perfectly balanced. Some atoms, called isotopes, are more stable than others because they have a different number of protons and neutrons in their nucleus. \nWhen an atom is radioactive, it means that the nucleus is unstable and will eventually break apart, or decay. This process releases energy and sometimes particles, such as alpha particles or beta particles, which are types of radiation. \nAt sites like Chernobyl, what is left behind after the radioactive atoms decay is called nuclear waste. This waste is still radioactive and can be dangerous to people and the environment if it is not properly stored and handled. \nNot all atoms or isotopes are radioactive. Some isotopes are stable and do not decay, while others are only slightly radioactive and take a very long time to decay. The stability of an atom or isotope depends on the balance of protons and neutrons in its nucleus. If there are too many or too few of either one, the atom can become unstable and start to decay.",

      "HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, was first identified in the 1980s, and in the early years of the epidemic, it was primarily associated with the gay, bisexual, and transgender communities. This association was largely due to the fact that HIV was initially identified in these communities and because it was primarily spread through sexual contact. However, it is important to note that HIV and AIDS do not discriminate and can affect anyone, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. \nIt is also important to recognize that the initial response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic was not always informed or compassionate. There was a lot of fear and misunderstanding surrounding the disease, and some people responded with stigma and discrimination towards those who were affected by it. This included blaming and shaming the gay community, even though HIV and AIDS can affect anyone, regardless of their sexual orientation. \nIt is important to remember that HIV and AIDS are serious public health issues that require understanding, education, and compassion, rather than fear and discrimination.",

    "generated_answer": [
      "Allergies are a type of immune system reaction that occurs when the body mistakes a normally harmless substance, such as pollen or peanuts, for a harmful invader. When this happens, the body releases chemicals called histamines in an attempt to protect itself, which can cause symptoms like sneezing, itchy eyes, and trouble breathing. \nIt's not clear why some people develop allergies and others don't. It's thought that a combination of genetic and environmental factors may play a role. For example, people who have a family history of allergies may be more likely to develop them, and certain environmental exposures (such as being exposed to cigarette smoke or pollution) may also increase the risk. \nIt's also not clear whether allergies are beneficial or not. Some scientists believe that allergies may have evolved as a way to protect against certain parasites or infections, but this is still an area of active research and debate. \nThere are some potential benefits to having allergies, such as increased sensitivity to certain substances or a heightened immune response.

When you purchase a pre - order , you 're giving the game developer money for a promise of delivered content . Many times , pre - order sales are driven by trailers and E3 presentations that create a certain set of expectations for the consumer . However , the developer is under no obligation to meet those expectations when they deliver the final product . Watch_Dogs is an excellent example of showing customers one thing to convince them to purchase pre - orders , and then ultimately delivering something that is less than what was shown . They can do this without consequence , because they already secured pre - order sales . By the time the game launched and people started complaining about the graphics being lower quality than what was shown at E3 , and the gameplay being rather generic instead of the groundbreaking experience that was promised , Ubisoft had already secured a heavy influx of sales revenue ... from pre - orders . The push to stop people from pre - ordering is to force developers to actually face the consequences of launching under - developed games . Assassin 's Creed Unity was a disaster at launch , but Ubisoft did n't face any real consequences for such a terrible release ... they already profited from the pre - order sales . Before pre - orders were so common , a game studio that attempted to launch a game infested with so many bugs would have suffered immeasurable losses , and either gone under or emerged from the experience with a powerful lesson learned . As /u / Nygmus mentioned in the case of Assassin 's Creed Unity , the blackout for reviews allowed Ubisoft to sell a broken game to a large number of people . But let 's ignore reviewers as they get early - access copies regardless of whether pre - ordering is a thing . If no one pre - orders a new game , that game 's sales figures will rely entirely on the game 's merit . If the game is good , you 'll hear about it and can go pick it up . If its bad , you 'll hear about that , and can save your money for something else . And that 's the core of it . By not pre - ordering , we are removing the cushion of revenue protection from developers . Without that cushion , they can not risk releasing a game that under performs . This will encourage some developers to exercise more quality control before releasing a game . It will also have the side - effect of causing some developers to just cancel projects that seem too risky . As a whole , its still a net benefit for the consumer . 2014 was a year where a lot of people gave up a lot of money and ended up being given an unsatisfying experience in return . The only way that consumers can influence developers is through their pocketbooks . And the only way this kind of behavior from developers will end , is if they ca n't financially get away with it . Hence , no more pre - orders . EDIT : I should clarify that in my train of thought above , I use the term developers as a rather loose blanket encapsulation for both developers and publishers . Publishers are usually the ones guilty of the above practices I mention , but developers can still be held responsible , and in some cases are even the ones driving the pre - order trend forward . I think both should be held equally accountable . And for what its worth , Indie developers are n't exempt ... early - access could have been a great tool for indie 's to polish and shape their creations into a profitable consumer - oriented product . But 2014 was determine to make early - access as nasty and filthy a word in this community as DRM and Day 1 DLC . EDIT2 : Oh wow , this frickin ' exploded completely unexpectedly ! I 'll do my best to respond to each of you as I can through the day , and thank you kind stranger for the Gold !"

      "Preordering games is a practice in which a customer pays for a game in advance of its release, sometimes receiving certain bonuses or perks for doing so. Some gamers have become opposed to preordering games for a variety of reasons. One reason is that it can be risky to preorder a game, because there is no way to know for certain whether the game will be good or not until it is actually released. If the game turns out to be disappointing, the customer who preordered it may feel like they wasted their money. \nAnother reason some gamers are against preordering is that it can create unnecessary pressure on game developers to meet certain deadlines or targets, which can lead to rushed or unfinished products. This can lead to a lower quality product and a less enjoyable gaming experience. \nFinally, some gamers believe that preordering games takes money away from smaller, independent game developers and instead supports larger, established companies. By not preordering games, gamers can show support for smaller developers and help promote diversity in the gaming industry. \nOverall, the decision to preorder a game is a personal one, and gamers may choose to do so for a variety of reasons, including to get bonus content or to show support for a particular game or developer. However, it is important to do research and consider the potential risks and rewards before making the decision to preorder a game.",

    "question": "What is the Mars One missions to Mars and is it really possible and going to happen ? Do they have the funding , technology , proper sanity , ect Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Hey there , aerospace engineer here who has experience in the space industry , and with college level mission design and analysis specifically oriented towards manned Mars missions . Mars one does not have the funding , technology , resources , time , scientific understanding , or technical acumen needed to pull off a mission of the caliber they are proposing . For their mission to succeed , several major things will need to change ; most are completely outside of the organization 's control . First , they will need an exorbitant amount of funds . Their projected plan is to use around $ 6 billion . Not only is this a ludicrously small amount , it 's a pretty sure sign of just how serious their program is ( not at all ) . As a conservative estimate , $ 20 billion is probably a better first guess for development of a Mars surface habitat capable of sustaining 4 people for a number of years . Cost drivers include a complete lack of appropriate Mars EDL ( entry , decent , and landing ) capabilities for large cargo , lack of a properly secured life support and resource utilization loop , launch and in space propulsion costs ( which alone would cost more than their projected mission costs to put several dozen tons of cargo on Mars ) , and other similarly large obstacles that require a good deal of funding well before their company will be able to sell the media rights to anyone ( and as far as I , or anyone else in the public is aware , no one is interested in buying to the tune of $ 6 + billion ) . Technology , science , and R & D : as I 've already pointed out , there are huge technical gaps left to completing a Mars mission , even ignoring the whole \" bring your astronauts home \" problem . Launch costs , Mars EDL , and life support are only the most visible and ( probably ) most costly examples . There are a huge variety of additional technical hurdles that Mars one has made little to no effort to adequately address . No human has ever spend more than a few days in an environment between 1 and 0 g 's . No one has created ISRU capabilities that are ready for industrial use and consumption on Mars . No one has used machines to remotely construct a habitat in a space - like environment , beyond self constructing satellites . No one has built structures on Mars ; the long term corrosive and erosive effects are not understood or adequately modelable on Earth . No one has sampled Martian soil , or measured it 's effects as a possible radiation shield ; without knowing how effective it is , it 's impossible to determine how much needs to be used to safely accommodate your astronauts , and thus how strong your structure needs to be to support it . No one has studied the psychological effects operating on astronauts embarking on known one way missions ; it is difficult to predict how team dynamics will play out , and how the astronaut 's sanity and productivity will be impacted . I could go on , but I think the point is clear . As far as time goes , their proposed schedule is as questionable as their budget , if not more so . With an initial funding of less than a few million dollars , they plan to have a custom built rover designed , built , launched , and to land on Mars by the early 2020 's . Let that sink in for a moment . This sort of endeavor takes many millions of dollars , and years just to develop . Their reason for optimism ? That they are going to reuse designs . To anyone who 's worked in the space program , this is a dubious way to save time and money . While it 's certainly better than starting from scratch ( in some cases ) , entire aspects of the rover 's design will always need to be re - examined , re built , re optimized , re analyzed , and re assessed for their impacts on the surrounding structure . I ca n't go to Lockheed Martin and buy another Mars rover , for buy one get one free . These things are n't bicycles , they are some of the most complicated pieces of robotic equipment designed and built . Testing alone takes years , unless you have the money to burn and risk to take to accelerate the schedule . And again , almost all of their proposed structures are going to need to be designed , redesigned , built , tested , redesigned , rebuilt , and retested from scratch , over many years and for billions of dollars . Their assessment of and relationship to the aerospace industry is also questionable . A true development plan does not consist of \" We will pay companies to design and build components to meet our needs \" . You ca n't go to one company , pay for a Mars rover to build your habitat , then go to another and pay for a habitat , then get to Mars and expect them to work together . You need teamwork , integration , cross compatible requirements and design considerations , communication between organizations concerned about intellectual property , profits , and competition , systems level testing and program management , clear program driving factors , and everything else that goes into making a mission like Apollo or ISS or Skylab work . To give one more , truly solid idea of just how unrealistic their plans are , consider this . To get to the moon on Apollo 8 , three astronauts launched atop a Saturn V in an Apollo CSM . The command / service module had a mass of almost 30 metric tons . It could support three astronauts for two weeks , with around 2 cubic meters of space for each astronaut . At the end of that journey , it was discarded . It had no ability to recycle food or water or air , or generate power . And it was launched on that journey by the Saturn V , the largest rocket ever to launch humans into space , a rocket that had more than twice the payload capacity of the Falcon Heavy , Mars one 's proposed launch vehicle . It took the full force of the US government , spending billions of dollars a year for almost a decade , to build the capabilities to travel to the moon , and the tools , engineering base , and equipment involved . Have spacecraft come significantly further in the intervening decades ? Yes . Has our understanding of the problems involved with a Mars mission ? Yes . Are we considerably more ready to tackle the challenge ? Yes . But that does n't change the fundamental variables : you need mass . You need time . You need money . You need expertise . You need launchers . You need organization , skill , planning , coordination , and a bureaucratic machine built to handle the legal , regulatory , ethical , and political ramifications of the mission you are undertaking . These are the things Mars one lacks ; not ideas or enthusiasm or spirit , but manpower and money and influence .",
      "As far as I know , after binge watching Ancient Aliens , there have been colonists on Mars for centuries . Seriously though , as far as I know , people have been shortlisted already , the technology is there for the most part ( except for more in - depth horticultural experiments ) , but it seems like the funding is coming in from many different places ( basically for businesses wanting to turn a profit on broadcasts , sponsors , crowdfunding etc ) . The Mars One website actually talks about their business model , comparing it to that of the Olympics . It 's gon na happen 2018 apparently .

From what I know a lot of money is going to new tech that instead of making it possible , makes it safer and more economically feasible , which in turn could attract even more money to the project .

      "The Mars One mission was a proposed plan to send humans to live on Mars permanently. The idea was to send a group of people to the planet and establish a permanent human settlement there. The mission was planned to be funded through a combination of private investment and media rights. \nHowever, the Mars One mission was never actually carried out, and it is no longer being pursued. There were many questions and concerns about the feasibility of the mission, including whether it had the necessary funding, technology, and support to be successful. Some experts also raised concerns about the psychological and physical effects of living on Mars permanently, and whether it would be safe for humans to do so. \nOverall, it is currently not possible for humans to live on Mars permanently, and it is not clear when or if this will ever be possible. There are many challenges to overcome, including developing the necessary technology, figuring out how to sustain human life on the planet, and finding a way to pay for the mission. While there have been several successful missions to Mars by NASA and other space agencies, these have been short-term visits rather than permanent settlements.",

      "It is generally considered acceptable to make satirical jokes about people's religion because the purpose of satire is to challenge and critique ideas or beliefs, often through humor. Satire can be a way to expose flaws or make a point about something in a way that is entertaining or thought-provoking. When people make satirical jokes about religion, they are not usually trying to offend or harm anyone, but rather to engage in a form of social or political commentary. \nOn the other hand, jokes that are racist or sexist are typically not considered acceptable because they are based on prejudice or discrimination against a particular group of people. These types of jokes rely on negative stereotypes and can contribute to a culture of intolerance and harm towards those who are the target of the jokes. Making jokes about someone's race or gender can also be a form of bullying or harassment, and is not considered a respectful or acceptable way to treat others.",

They may also store food to eat during the winter when there isn't as much to find outside. \nSome insects, like moths and butterflies, lay their eggs in the fall, and the eggs hatch into larvae or caterpillars in the spring. The larvae then grow into adult insects and emerge when the weather gets warmer. \nOther insects, like ladybugs and praying mantises, go into a state of dormancy during the winter. This means that they stop moving and become very still, almost like they are sleeping. They are able to do this because their bodies are able to slow down their metabolism and use very little energy until the weather gets warm again. \nSo, insects have many different ways of surviving the winter, but they all have to find a way to stay warm, find food, and avoid predators until the weather gets warm again.",

      "Oil spills can happen for a variety of reasons, and it can be difficult to completely eliminate the risk of an oil spill occurring. For example, oil spills can occur due to human error, such as when a ship captain makes a mistake while navigating or when a worker at an oil refinery mishandles equipment. Oil spills can also occur due to equipment failure, such as when a pipe or tanker ship develops a leak. \nThere are measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of oil spills, such as improving the design of oil transport vessels and pipelines, training workers to follow safety protocols, and implementing emergency response plans to quickly contain and clean up spills when they do occur. However, it can be challenging to completely eliminate the risk of an oil spill, especially given the complexity of the systems involved in the transport and processing of oil.",

It allows more accuracy in a ordinance - expended - to - kill ratio , being that accurate shots are easier to make at closer distances , especially in times before rifled barrels were in wide use .

      "In movies and in real life, soldiers are usually told not to fire their weapons until they are close enough to the enemy because it increases the chances of hitting their target. When a person shoots a gun, the bullet travels through the air and can be affected by things like wind, gravity, and other forces. The farther away the target is, the more time the bullet has to be affected by these forces, which can make it more difficult to hit the target. \nSo, if a soldier is too far away from the enemy, their bullets might not hit the enemy even if they are aiming at them. This is why it's important to wait until the soldier is close enough to the enemy before firing their weapon. This way, the bullet has less time to be affected by external forces and is more likely to hit the target. \nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

      "Democrats want to put money into social programs . They believe that given the chance , most people will work . However there are a significant percentage of people who are not working because of issues surrounding education , child care , health or other aspects of being poor . Essentially they want to \" help people up , so they can get back to work \" Getting more people to work will improve their quality of life AND bring in additional tax money ( because working people pay more taxes ) . Basically they want to soften the landing so when people fall off the ladder they can get back on and keep climbing . Democrats feel that if you give extra money to rich people they are only going to spend it on rich people things and that wo n't benefit poor people at all . Republicans are the opposite . They think that if you give money to people who are not working , you create an incentive to be a lazy ass . They think that if you make it harsher to be poor , fewer people will want to be poor and therefore more people will work . They also feel that if you give tax breaks to the wealthy then those wealthy people will use that money to invest in businesses who will turn that investment into jobs . Generally republicans favor lower taxes in an effort to increase the tax basis . Democrats want to increase the tax basis by spending money to bring poor people up to a level where they can be productive workers .",
      "In an attempt to summarize this as simply as possible with minimal bias : Republicans ( in general ) believe the free market is the best way to run the economy . This means that they support minimal government regulation and taxation of businesses . The theory is that if everyone does business in the most effective way for them , then everyone will benefit from overall economic growth . Republicans tend to have an ideology of \" small government \" in this way . Democrats are less trusting of the free market . They tend to argue that just because a business makes money , it does not follow that everyone who contributes to that business will as well . They argue that since the rich have more money , they have more power in the free market and so the free market does n't necessarily help the people who need it . To deal with this , democrats tend to support taxing and regulating businesses more so the money can be spent on public programs , particularly those that help those with less money . Keep in mind , this is pretty simplified , and just my understanding of it as an American who does n't affiliate with any party , but still sits slightly left - of - center politically . I hope this helps a bit .",
      "To add to what /u / hot4you11 said , Republicans believe that by reducing taxes for the rich and allowing them to keep more of their money then they will buy more stuff and thereby help the economy move . Republicans also see high taxes on the rich as punishing success . They also believe that by lowering taxes and cutting spending they can actually increase gov't revenues . How ? With more money to spend , people will do more and thereby allow for more taxing opportunities . This is , of course , complete bullshit . Source : Former Republican"

      "In the United States, the Republican Party and the Democratic Party are two major political parties that have different ideas about how to address economic issues. Here is a general overview of some of the main differences in economic policy between the two parties: \nRepublicans: \nTend to support lower taxes, especially for businesses and high-income earners. They believe that lower taxes will stimulate economic growth and create jobs.\nTend to support smaller government and fewer regulations. They believe that the government should not interfere too much in the economy and that businesses should be free to operate as they see fit.\nTend to support free trade and global economic integration. They believe that free trade helps to increase economic efficiency and create wealth. \nDemocrats: \nTend to support higher taxes, especially for businesses and high-income earners. They believe that higher taxes are necessary to fund important government programs and reduce income inequality.\nTend to support larger government and more regulations. They believe that the government has a role in regulating the economy to protect workers and the environment, and to ensure that all Americans have access to basic services like healthcare and education.\nTend to support more protectionist trade policies and a greater emphasis on domestic production. They believe that these policies can help to create and protect American jobs. \nWhen it comes to international economic policy, both parties generally support policies that promote economic growth and stability around the world. However, they may have different ideas about how to achieve these goals. For example, Republicans may prioritize free trade and economic integration, while Democrats may prioritize domestic economic growth and the protection of American jobs.",

    "question": "The meaning / message of Forest Gump watched it last night for the first time in years . Great movie Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "To me , I think they use Forest as a way to view past events in US history through the eyes of a child . The entire movie he is seen as an idiot by others ( stupid is as stupid does ) , but the way he describes situations like Vietnam , watergate , civil rights , and others from his naive standpoint shows us how silly or selfish these events were in our past ( whether it was a war we should n't have been in , a scandal that should n't have happened , or prejudices that were unfounded ) .",
      "This is from /u / namtara from URL_0 This is way late , but it needs to be said . Jenny from Forrest Gump . She gets so much goddamn flak from people who have seen the movie . It 's like they tuned out completely at the normal human experience just because they think Forrest is adorable . Jenny did n't think she was in love with Forrest because she thought she was taking advantage of him the same way her father molested her . For fucks sake , Forrest is retarded . Jenny , out of everyone who 's ever met him , knows this best of all . She knows that her closest friend and only loved one is a fucking idiot . Imagine that . Imagine for one second that the only person who was always kind to you was someone who did n't know any better . Everyone in the world who knew about your father looked at you either as a victim or as something disgusting , but that one man does n't . And it 's because he 's retarded . Jenny does n't think that way at the start . As a kid , she just thinks he 's different and is just glad to have a friend . But as she gets older , especially as a teenager , she realizes that her closest friend will never mature like she does . He loves her like he would anything and everything else , so long as its nice or cuddly , like a pet or a sibling , at least in her mind . Her father treated her like shit , and there was no way in hell others did n't do the same when they found out she was molested . She would have wanted to feel loved . That 's where she gets the abusive relationship crap . She wants so much to be loved that she does n't understand that they are taking advantage of her . She thinks that as long as they are n't forcing her to have sex , that 's normal . Getting beat on , pressured to drug addiction , and dragged around into whatever dangerously extreme political bands they 're into is just fine , as long as they do n't rape her . That 's why she 's so shocked when Forrest defends her from harm . Why would anyone do that if what they 're doing to her is normal ? She keeps leaving Forrest behind because she convinces herself that he does n't really love her . She convinces herself that his affections are shallow , since he would never be able to really understand love either . I mean really , how many of you honestly think someone who is that mentally challenged could understand the complexities and nuances of love ? There 's no way they could . What they have is something simple , and Jenny does n't think that could be real . And even IF she believed he could , even IF she got out of that abusive cycle , she knows better . FFS , if that scene with Forrest and her in her college dormroom had the genders reversed , people would be so fucking uncomfortable about that scene because it 'd be inching so close to rape . Jenny knows that . She realizes that . That is why she shuts off her feelings for Forrest , above any other reasons to stay away : she thinks she is molesting him . She saw how uncomfortable he was when she did that and thought holy fuck , what the hell am I doing ? Can you imagine how twisted you must feel after realizing in that moment that you turned into the father who molested you ? How the fuck can you love yourself after doing that to your best friend , when you know what that 's like ? Would you ever let yourself get close to them again if you really cared about them ? So Jenny kept running away . Every time Forrest gets close and saves her , she runs off before she falters . She wo n't let herself get near him , and as the movie goes on , she fails a little more each time . First she blows him off after the strip club , telling him to stay away . Then she walks with him in DC , but still leaves with her boyfriend . Then she stays with him in his house and finally sleeps with him , after that one critical moment . When he tells her he does know what love is , and asks her why she does n't love him . She finally gives in and does sleep with him , but can you imagine thinking afterwards ? Would you , in her shoes , with absolute and unwavering certainty , think you did the right thing ? Or would you be afraid that you did exactly what you had been avoiding because you do actually care that much about him ? So she runs away . She hides her child from him , because she thinks he should n't have to worry or pay for something he ca n't handle . She thinks she 's wronged him , and the least she could do is set things right by raising a good child , without dragging him down . And then she gets sick . Doctors do n't know what it is , but she 's going to die . Her kid is only a few years old . Can you imagine struggling with that decision to tell your victim that they have a kid and now they have to take care of it because you 're going to die ? That 's what she struggles with before coming to terms with the fact that she 's happy with him , and he 's happy with her , and that 's what love actually is . It 's something simple and unconditional , and even Forrest can understand it . It takes her her whole goddamn life to figure out that love is just that simple , and she dies months afterwards . She realized she had been running away from what made her happy , and it is n't wrong , and she only gets so much time together before it 's over . And instead of realizing that narrative even exists in the story , people just bitch about how Jenny is such a slut , but she wo n't even love the only person who cares about her . Jenny always loved Forrest , during the whole fucking movie . She loved him so much , she thought she was taking advantage of him and ran away for his sake . She did n't realize she was wrong until it was almost too late . Fuck , that 's depressing . EDIT : Obligatory gushing , but actually I just wanted to add a TL;DR : TL;DR : Jenny thought she was molesting Forrest because he could n't understand what love is , so she either suppressed her feelings or ran away .",
      "The idea of the movie is that one should essentially go with the flow . Forest never makes a decision for himself in the entire film ; he 's always given suggestions and directions that lead to fantastic events in his life . The most over references to this in the movie are the opening and closing shots , which depict a feather being carried by the wind . The father represents Forest as he is guided through life ."

    "human_answer": [
      "The point of green screen is that it 's such an even but uncommon shade of green that you can essentially plug any shot into a program and have that program replace all the green with the special effects you 've created . It 's essentially a \" replace this with * x * \" tool so it 'll naturally pick out gaps like that in the actors hair . That being said , it 's not perfect and there can often be a little left over green right next to the hair . One of the lowest - paid , most arduous tasks in special effects belongs to a team who trace out the actor 's hair frame by frame , follicle by follicle to catch that little extra and make the effects look cleaner .",
      "What you also will do is use different kind of settings on different places of the actor . For example there is more likely to be natural shades of green in clothing , but cloth and the body has a sharp outline so it 's you use a setting for that . Hair usually do n't have a natural shade of green so you can remove a lot more of the green . In the example image the reason the green is n't removed is because it is n't green enough for the softwares threshold . And around the body because it 's a very clear contrast towards the green you can go with a high threshold to get the body shape . But if you instead changed the threshold on the software and made it go more transparent the more green it has , the hair will become natural transparent where the hairs are thin . And when using the different settings on the hair you will most likely rotoscope a quick outline around the hair where the less sensitive settings will be applied . If the \" hair settings \" applied to the entire actor you will start so see flickering on the person and he would become slighty transparent . [ Example on greenscreen settings bad for hair . ] ( URL_0 )",

      "Green screen technology is used in film and video production to allow filmmakers to superimpose one video clip over another. It works by filming a subject in front of a green or blue background, which can then be removed in post-production and replaced with any other desired image or video. \nTo remove the green screen from an actor's hair, film editors can use a technique called \"chroma keying.\" This involves using specialized software to select the green (or blue) color in the background and \"key it out,\" or remove it from the image. The software looks for pixels in the image that match the color of the green screen, and then removes them, replacing them with a transparent area. \nOnce the green screen has been removed, the editor can then add in a new background image or video behind the actor. This allows filmmakers to create the illusion that the actor is in a completely different location or environment, even if they were actually filmed in front of a plain green or blue screen. \nI hope this explanation helps!

      "There are a few reasons why companies might hire foreign people to do technical or customer support. One reason is that it can be less expensive to hire workers in other countries, especially if the cost of living is lower there. For example, if a company is based in a country with a high cost of living, it might be able to save money by hiring workers in a country with a lower cost of living. \nAnother reason is that there may be a shortage of qualified candidates in the company's home country, or the company may have difficulty finding people with the necessary skills or experience. In these cases, the company may look to other countries to find the talent it needs. \nWhile it's true that language barriers can sometimes be a challenge when working with foreign technical or customer support staff, many companies provide language training or hire staff who are fluent in the language used by their customers. Additionally, advances in technology, such as translation software, can also help to bridge language gaps. \nOverall, companies hire foreign workers for technical or customer support for a variety of reasons, including cost savings and access to a larger pool of qualified candidates. While there can be challenges, many companies have found ways to successfully work with foreign staff and provide high-quality support to their customers.",

      "Last time someone asked this question , it was explained that natural sounds produce a wide range of sounds , not all within the range of human hearing , while manmade speakers do not tend to replicate those sounds beyond the range of human hearing because why would they . So dogs can hear a difference between artificial and natural sounds ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "Animals, including dogs, are able to hear a wider range of frequencies than humans. They also have a more finely tuned sense of hearing, which allows them to pick up on sounds that we may not be able to hear. This is why your dog may be able to hear your voice or other sounds while sleeping, but may not react to music or other digital sounds. \nOne reason for this is that animals are more sensitive to sounds that are associated with potential threats or dangers. For example, a dog may be more likely to wake up if they hear the sound of someone approaching or talking, because these sounds could indicate the presence of a potential threat. On the other hand, music and other digital sounds may not be as closely associated with potential threats, so the dog may not react to them as readily. \nIt's also possible that your dog may have become accustomed to hearing music while they are sleeping, and has learned to ignore it as a result. Dogs are highly adaptable and can quickly learn to associate certain stimuli with positive or negative experiences. If your dog has had positive experiences while music was playing, they may be more likely to ignore it, even if it is played loudly. \nIn general, it's important to remember that every animal is different and may react differently to different stimuli. Some dogs may be more sensitive to sounds than others, and may be more likely to wake up in response to music or other digital sounds. Similarly, some dogs may be more resilient and may be able to sleep through loud noises that would wake up other dogs.",

    "generated_answer": [
      "Super glue is a type of adhesive that is made up of a liquid chemical called cyanoacrylate. It is a very strong adhesive that can bond many different materials together, including plastic, metal, and glass. \nOne reason that super glue sticks to most surfaces is because it can chemically bond with the molecules on the surface of the material. When the glue comes into contact with the surface, it starts to harden and form a strong bond. \nHowever, the inside of the glue bottle is made of a special type of plastic that does not allow the glue to bond with it. This is because the plastic is coated with a special chemical that prevents the glue from sticking to it. \nAs for why super glue does not work in outer space, it's because there is no oxygen present in space. Super glue needs oxygen to harden and form a strong bond, so without oxygen, the glue cannot harden and it will not work properly. \nI hope this helps to explain why super glue sticks to most surfaces but not to the inside of the glue bottle, and why it does not work in outer space.",

Since there was no Greek word for \u00e2\u0080\u009c son - in - law , \u00e2\u0080\u009d Joseph was called the \u00e2\u0080\u009c son of Heli \u00e2\u0080\u009d by marriage to Mary , Heli \u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter .

      "In the Christian tradition, Jesus is believed to be the son of God and the fulfillment of ancient Jewish prophecies. One of these prophecies, found in the Hebrew Bible, states that the Messiah, or savior, would be descended from the line of King David. Because Mary was engaged to be married to Joseph at the time of Jesus' conception and birth, it was traditionally believed that Joseph was Jesus' legal father and that Jesus inherited his royal lineage through Joseph. \nThis belief is based on the idea that in ancient times, a person's family and ancestry were traced through the father's side. So even though Jesus and Joseph were not biologically related, Jesus was considered to be part of the family of Joseph and therefore part of the royal line of King David. \nIt's important to note that this belief about Jesus' ancestry is based on tradition and faith, and it is not a scientific or historical fact.",

First, the curve of the screen can help to reduce distortion and improve the overall image quality of the TV. This is because the curve of the screen helps to align the pixels on the screen more evenly, which can help to reduce image distortion and improve the overall picture quality. \nSecond, the curve of the screen can also make the TV feel more immersive and surround-like, as it can give the impression of the screen wrapping around your field of vision.

    "question": "How does city zoning work in London ? For example , Camden is a borough in the city of Westminster which itself is in the city of London . How is it that a city exists within a city ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Lifelong Londoner here . I 'll try to explain . First , you have one outright mistake in your question , and a couple of points of confusion . The outright mistake is this : \" Camden is a borough in the city of Westminster \" . No , it is n't . So let 's try to clarify . \" Greater London \" is a geographic and political entity . It 's approximately 600 square miles in size and has a population of around 8.5 million people . Certain functions , such as transport and many development and economic issues , are considered important enough that there is an elected mayor for the whole of Greater London ( known , unsurprisingly , as the Mayor of London , but we 'll come back to this ) , and an elected body , the Greater London Assembly , which between them set policies . The Mayor and GLA also provide the budget for the police and fire service in London , and have a say in their running . To provide more local representation and deal with less London - wide issues , Greater London is then subdivided into 33 boroughs . One of these boroughs is the London Borough of Camden , another is the London Borough of the City of Westminster ( we 'll come to the reason for it having \" city \" in its name later ) . But Camden and Westminster are completely separate entities ; apart from the fact that they 're both one of the 33 boroughs they have nothing else in common . Most of the boroughs have an official name of \" The London Borough of * whatever * \" but a couple are called \" The City of * whatever * \" . This is because the history of human settlement in the London area dates way , way , back , long before the establishment of Greater London . For example the city of Westminster grew up from about the 10th century , so as the area that was later called London grew it was eventually swallowed up . The borough retains the name of what was once a separate , independent city , however . And then there 's the borough called \" The City of London \" . This one is special in many ways . The City of London ( the word \" City \" is * * always * * spelt with a capital in this context ) is tiny . It 's only about one square mile in size . It 's essentially the area that once sat within the old Roman walls of their city of * Londinium * , and today it 's completely dominated by being the headquarters of many financial companies -- so much so that in the UK simply saying \" The City \" is a shorthand way of saying \" financial services companies \" , just as in the US saying \" Wall Street \" has the same connotation . Despite being a borough of Greater London , the City of London has many special privileges and rights , which have been laid down over about a thousand years worth of legislation . In particular it elects its own mayor , known as \" The Lord Mayor of London \" although this is now a ceremonial position rather than one with any specific power . The City has its own separate police force from the rest of Greater London , has many of its own laws , and ( somewhat controversially ) positions on the City of London council are voted for by the corporations that are based in the City , rather than the ( very few ) people who live there , as happens in every other UK election .",
      "> How is it that a city exists within a city ? but to be honest , what does it change ? we have countries ( Vatican ) withing countries ( Italy ) , so city ( City of London ) within the city ( London / Greater London ) is not problematic at all . > But trapping nations is not just Italy 's thing for there 's also Lesotho , in South Africa which is both the largest encircled country at 70 times Vatican City 's size and the most populated with over 2,000,000 citizens . from [ CGPGrey bizarre borders ] ( URL_0 )",
      "This gets * very * confusing and I do n't have time to go into it all right now . Just as a quick starter though , the City of London ( note capitalisation ) is actually a separate entity to the larger metropolitan area of London , the capital city of the UK . It 's the most ancient part of London and is relatively tiny , being nicknamed ' The Square Mile ' as it 's , whaddya know , approximately 1sq mile in size .

      "Time dilation is a phenomenon that occurs when an object moves very fast relative to another object. According to the theory of relativity, time appears to move slower for objects that are moving very fast compared to objects that are not moving as fast. This means that if you were to travel in a fast-moving car or airplane, the clock on board would appear to run slower than a clock on the ground. \nHowever, the difference in time between the two clocks is very small, and it would be almost impossible to notice the difference unless you were able to travel at very high speeds for a very long period of time. For example, if you were to travel in a car at the speed of light for one year, the clock on the car would appear to run about 20 minutes slower than the clock on the ground. \nSo, even though time dilation does occur, the effects are usually too small to notice in everyday life.

    "human_answer": [
      "Just like everyone else ; the English alphabet does n't change if you 're Chinese ... On a more serious note , there are two ways : 1 . You group in radicals ( i.e. the radical \u00e5\u00a5\u00b3 means \" woman \" and makes all characters that contain it have a feminine quality : - \u00e5\u00a6\u0088 = Mother - \u00e5\u00a7\u0090 = older sister - \u00e5\u00a5\u00bd = good Within radicals , you group by number of strokes needed to write that radical : - \u00e5\u00a5\u00b3 takes 3 strokes to write - \u00e6\u009c\u00a8 takes 4 strokes to write Therefore , words that contain \u00e5\u00a5\u00b3 as a radical come before those that contain \u00e6\u009c\u00a8 in a dictionary . For a complete list of radicals in the order they come in a dictionary : URL_3 2 . The other way to alphabetize is quite modern since it 's a western adaptation . Every character in mandarin Chinese can be pronounced using the western alphabet plus an accent , so in dictionaries that use this classification , they 'll convert \u00e5\u00a5\u00b3 to \" n\u00c7\u009a \" , \u00e5\u00a6\u0088 to \" m\u00c4\u0081 \" , \u00e5\u00a7\u0090 to \" ji\u00c4\u009b \" . It would work just like an English dictionary , j coming before m , \u00e5\u00a7\u0090 would come before \u00e5\u00a6\u0088 . Now to classify accents , they follow this simple order : - Flat accent ( horizontal line above the letter you want accented ) comes first : - ( e.g. \u00c4\u0081 ) - Ascending accent comes second : / ( e.g. \u00c3\u00a9 ) - Valley accent comes third : v ( e.g. \u00c4\u009b ) - Descending accent comes fourth and last : \\ ( e.g. \u00c3\u00a0 ) There are of course special cases like \u00c2\u00a8 , but that 's more advanced , and not incredibly relevant to the main question .

      "China , Taiwan and Singapore use a system called [ Pinyin ] ( URL_0 ) which transcribes the Manderin pronunciation of Chinese characters into the Latin alphabet and is alphabetized similar to in English .",
      "Long time lurker , first time poster . So let 's get started shall we ? I speak Mandarin as my second language , and am more familiar with the simplified version . There are two types of Mandarin : simplified and traditional . Trust me , the traditional version is much more convoluted than the simplified one . Firstly , in Mandarin , there is probably no equivalent of alphabetization , at least not in the conventional way . This is n't really surprising , since the characters descended from pictograms - images that convey a message . Thus , you can see that Mandarin characters more closely resemble pictures , rather than the normal alphabets that we see in English . Now then , how do we depict Mandarin characters ? Most simple characters consist of a left side and a right side . In some cases , both sides tell a story . For example , the character \u00e8\u00af\u009d is made up of \u00e8\u00a8\u0080(this is the traditional version of the left side ) and \u00e8\u0088\u008c . The left tells us that this word is related to speech , since \u00e8\u00a8\u0080 means speech . The right is the character for the tongue . Put them together , and you get the character for the English equivalent of word . Speech from the tongue = word . Then again , it is n't always so simple . For some characters , only one side tells a story . I 'll take the example raised by /u / pudmedcentury . \u00e5\u00a7\u0090 is made up of \u00e5\u00a5\u00b3 and \u00e4\u00b8\u0094 . \u00e5\u00a5\u00b3 tell us that this character is referencing to something feminine . However , as far as I know , \u00e4\u00b8\u0094 does not give any meaning to \u00e5\u00a7\u0090 . For the record , \u00e5\u00a7\u0090 means older sister , which addresses the feminine portion . Some characters operate in a different way - up and down . The character \u00e7\u0083\u00ab which means hot or scalded , is made up of \u00e6\u00b1\u00a4(soup ) and \u00e7\u0081\u00ab(fire ) . In the past , people probably got scalded by hot soup most frequently , leading to this character . Fire + soup = hot ( or if you are unlucky , scalded ) . There are many more orientations to Mandarin characters , including single words ( e.g. \u00e4\u00ba\u00ba which means person ) , top - left - right ( e.g. \u00e6\u00a3\u00ae which means forest ) , left - top - bottom ( e.g. \u00e7\u00a5\u00b8 which means disaster ) . As usual , some parts have meaning , some parts do n't ( as far as I know ) . There are just too many to list , and as such , I do n't think that Mandarin characters can be alphabetized in an English sort of way . How then do Mandarin dictionaries work ? Every character has a pronunciation , which is translated to English alphabets . So \u00e6\u00a3\u00ae is sen , \u00e4\u00ba\u00ba is ren , \u00e7\u0083\u00ab is tang . Basically , all the characters are arranged in alphabetical order , which makes the foundation of the dictionary . However , every translation normally has 4 tones . In Mandarin we call them \u00e5\u00a3\u00b0(sh\u00c4\u0093ng ) , or sound . In speech , the 4 tones of the same translation sound different , with each tone having many characters . So \u00e6\u00b1\u00a4(t\u00c4\u0081ng - first tone ) , \u00e5\u00a0\u0082(t\u00c3\u00a1ng - second tone ) , \u00e8\u00ba\u00ba(t\u00c7\u008eng - third tone ) , \u00e7\u0083\u00ab(t\u00c3\u00a0ng - fourth tone ) all sound different and have different meanings , \u00e5\u00a0\u0082 , \u00e7\u00b3\u0096 , \u00e5\u00a1\u0098 , \u00e8\u0086\u009b ( t\u00c3\u00a1ng ) all sound the same , but have different meanings . Characters in dictionaries are first arranged by alphabets , and within same translations , arranged by tones . This is probably the closest that we have to alphabetization in Mandarin . There are many more aspects to Mandarin , like the fifth tone ( \u00c3\u00bc ) and the sequence to writing Mandarin characters . This is an incredibly complex language to learn with an incredibly large amount of vocabulary . Feel free to ask any questions or correct any mistakes that I made , or even to ask for the meaning of any characters that I used ."

Chinese characters represent the pronunciation of a word and its meaning, but they do not represent individual sounds like the letters of an alphabet do. \nInstead of using an alphabet, Chinese people use a system called pinyin to alphabetize words. Pinyin is a system that represents the sounds of Chinese characters using the letters of the Latin alphabet. For example, the Chinese character for \"apple\" is \u00e8\u008b\u00b9\u00e6\u009e\u009c (p\u00c3\u00adng gu\u00c7\u0092) in pinyin. \nTo alphabetize words in Chinese using pinyin, you would simply arrange the words in order based on the pinyin spelling. For example, \"apple\" would come before \"banana\" because \"a\" comes before \"b\" in the alphabet. \nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

However, the US dollar is the most commonly used currency for oil trading because it is the most widely accepted and stable currency in the world. \nThere are a few reasons why the US dollar is the preferred currency for oil trading. First, the United States is the largest consumer of oil in the world, so it makes sense that oil would be priced in the currency of the largest market. Second, the US dollar is the most widely traded currency in the world, so it is easily accessible to most oil-producing and oil-consuming countries. Finally, the US dollar is considered a stable currency, which is important for oil traders because oil prices can be volatile and using a stable currency helps to reduce risk. \nIn summary, the US dollar is used for oil trading because it is the currency of the largest market, it is widely accepted, and it is stable.",

    "question": "What happens when you transfer blood that does n't match a person in that specific blood type ? Did they just have to go around testing and killing people with the wrong blood type till they got it ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Some quick background : blood types overlap , for instance someone who has AB positive blood can have blood transfusions of any type without reaction . Whereas someone who has A positive can receive all but B positive or B negative . In a case where someone gets a transfusion of the wrong type ( This pretty much does n't happen ) then that blood is seen as an \" intruder \" and the body starts to attack it . As the antibodies bind to the red blood cells they will start to group together which can create blood clots , then the antibodies destroy the cells . However as I said this does n't happen as you always check blood types before doing an transfusion . Only time you would n't check is if its an emergency where you would use O negative since its a universal donor .",
      "When a foreign body enters your blood system ( a virus , a bacterium etc . ) it has antigens on it surface . Think if these antigens as an ID for that body . Your immune system can read these antigens , and if it recognizes them as friendly , it lets them be , if it does not , it attacks them , and if it remembers them as a pathogen ( disease causing body ) it uses specific attacks . Now your own blood cells have antigens too , and your blood type corresponds to the presence of that antigen . A means antigen type A , B means type B , AB means presence of both , and O is presence of neither . If you 're type A and you 're given type B blood , your immune system will attack the type B blood cells because it wo n't recognize them , it will however , leave your type A cells alone . Your immune cells and antibodies ( proteins that help fight disease ) will attach to the foreign blood cells and destroy them . This can cause blood clots , and result in internal hemorrhage ( bleeding ) , which can lead to death . This is why blood typing is very important . There is also another aspect of blood typing to consider , this is Rh factoring . This is what is meant by being A positive , or B negative . Positive Rh means that you have the Rh antigen on your blood cells , and Rh negative means you do not . If you have are negative for Rh , and you receive Rh positive blood , regardless of whether the A or B was correct , the immune system will still attack the Rh positive blood . This is why AB positive is the universal recipient , as it has both AB , and Rh antigens , so the immune system has been exposed to everything , and it will not attack any different blood type . It is also why O negative is the universal donor , it has neither A , B , nor Rh antigens , so the immune system does not attack . ( AB and Rh are not the only antigens on your blood cells , there are many more , but these are the three most important ) Source : 5 years in EMS and various physiology classes",
      "Your blood type is based on what proteins are present on the surface of your red blood cells . There are three types of proteins we 're interested in . We will call these proteins A , B and Rh . You can have all of these proteins , none of them , or any combination . The letter part of your blood type is determined by the A and B proteins . If you have both types , you are AB . If you only have A , you are A , only B is B. If you have neither A nor B , you are type O. O means \" lacks both A and B. \" The + or - on your blood type is based on the Rh protein . If you have the Rh protein , you are Rh positive , which gives you a + on your blood type . If you do not have the Rh protein , you are Rh negative , and get a - on your blood type . A - is similar to type O. It just means your blood does not contain this protein . Your immune system will attack anything it does n't recognize . That includes blood cells . As long as the blood cells in a transfusion do not have anything your body does not recognize , your body will accept it . If your body sees a protein it does not recognize , it will attack the new blood cells . For example , if you are B+ and you get any type of blood with the A protein in it , your body will attack the new blood . As long as the new blood does not contain A , it will work just fine . This means a B+ can accept B- , O+ , etc . , but not A- , AB+ , etc . This is why O- is called a \" universal donor \" . O- blood can be given to anybody . The immune system of a B+ person will look at the O- blood and say , \" I do n't see anything here I do n't recognize \" and leave it alone . This makes O- blood more in demand , because if someone in an emergency room needs a blood transfusion , and there 's no chance to find out the blood type , they have to use O- to be safe . This also makes it sort of nice to be AB+ , because an AB+ can receive blood from any donor ."

      "When a person receives a blood transfusion, it is very important that the blood type of the donor and the recipient are compatible. If a person receives a blood transfusion with incompatible blood, it can cause serious problems and can even be life-threatening. \nThere are different blood types, and each person has one of these types: A, B, AB, or O. In addition to these blood types, there is also a factor called the Rh factor, which can be positive or negative. This means that there are eight possible blood types: A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, and O-. \nWhen a person receives a blood transfusion, their immune system may recognize the donated blood as foreign and attack it. This can cause a reaction called transfusion reaction, which can lead to serious complications such as anemia, kidney damage, and even death. \nTo avoid transfusion reactions, doctors and hospitals carefully match the blood type of the donor and recipient before a transfusion is given. They do this by testing the blood of both the donor and recipient to determine their blood type and Rh factor. This way, they can make sure that the donated blood is compatible with the recipient's blood, and that the transfusion will be safe. \nIn the past, it was common for doctors to try different blood types on patients to see which one worked best. However, this practice was very risky and led to many deaths. Today, doctors and hospitals use careful blood typing and testing to ensure that transfusions are as safe as possible.",

    "question": "When a singer is performing during a concert and they have an earpiece , what are they listening to ? Not sure if this is the best subreddit for this question , but I thought it was appropriate than askreddit . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "It 's an in - ear monitor . It helps the singer keep in tune by blocking out external noise and playing back the band audio through the earpiece so the singer can hear themselves in relation to the rest of the band . Without such monitors , it 's actually very difficult for singers to sing in tune because the sound of the band gets drowned out by everyone in the audience and most people ca n't sing with absolute pitch ( i.e. sing the correct frequency / pitch without a reference point ) . As an alternative to ( or in combination with ) in - ear monitors , there often speakers set up on stage that are pointed directly toward the singer / band members that perform a similar function . In - ear monitors are also sometimes used to secretly provide instructions or other messages to performers . Edit : It 's also worth noting that , in some cases , the audio played back through the in - ear monitor is a pre - recorded version of the song ( e.g. from an album ) . Each band member and/or dancer can then match their live performance to the track played in their ear . This has the added benefit of maintaining consistency ( e.g. in tempo and pitch ) across performances . This approach also keeps the singer in tune , so long as the band instruments are tuned correctly .",
      "In a live music setting you generally have two people who are behind the scenes making sure the music is at the right levels . The first person ( arguably the most important ) is the FoH , or Front of House . This engineer is responsible for the sound the audience hears . The entire mix is sent to FoH and blasted out from the speakers you 'll notice above the theater , etc . The two most important roles for this Engineer is : 1 . Avoid any type of feedback at all costs , through EQ'ing and Limiters / brickwallers . 2 . Providing a good public mix for the audience . The second person ( the one responsible for those in - ear mics ) is the Monitor Engineer . This engineer is solely responsible in doing two objectives : 1 . To prevent feedback to the artist 's in - ear mix or stage monitor mix . 2 . To provide each artist with their own custom mix to aid in bettering the artist 's performance . Often times , each musician / artist on stage will request a different mix of the live mix in order to help them . For instance , a singer might not want to hear anything in his / her mix but the snare top and the bass drum / guitar . The guitarist might not want to hear anything but the drums and the singer . Likewise , the drummer may only want to hear the bass and the guitars . This ensures that each artist only hears the elements of a track or song that keep them in time and focused . There are many bands who absolutely hate in - ear monitors , and some who can not live without them . Taylor Swift can be found in one of her videos ( sorry , do n't have the link ) taking out her in - ear monitor because she has a huge problem with not being able to focus properly with two mixes . For the early part of her career , you could see her rip out her IEMs multiple times , and it would frustrate the monitor engineer quite a bit , because they were n't sure if she was having issues with the mix or if she just could n't coordinate the two mixes . Other bands , like Muse absolutely love their IEMs . Here 's the IEM mix for Chris from Muse ( bassist ) on Hysteria : URL_1 Notice that there is very little guitar or anything else mixed louder than the metronome track ( what we would call a \" click track \" ) . These IEMs are fantastic for bands with progressive track layouts or fast - paced - tough - to - nail rhythms . For most house bands , IEMs are not necessary ( especially in smaller settings where the band is close to one another or have their own stage monitors set up . Some bands use both and some bands use one or the other . Protip : When working as a Monitor Engineer that has both on stage and IE monitors , turning down the on - stage monitor volumes when a musician approaches their microphone to sing or have IEMs in can keep from causing feedback loops . When an artist walks away from a monitor , there is no need to have that monitor play , so it is turned down . Protip#2 : IEMs can cause feedback , too ! There are many situations in which an artist 's mix is so loud or turns their head to the side that the microphones can pick up the Monitor Engineer 's mix , causing feedback . This will feedback into the Mon . Engineer 's mix and cause huge issues for both the artist and the Mon . Engineer . Hope this helps you understand the importance of not just IEMs , but the roles of those associated with taking care of those monitors . EDIT : As many have pointed out , IEMs can also provide a method to relay instruction from the Monitor Engineer or other black - shirts ( those guys responsible for bringing the sound to you ) . Think about this the next time you go to a concert . Watch for hand signals or awkward / silly looks the band members might make to someone off stage or even on stage . These could be signals to the Mon . Engineer or other staff to make an adjustment . Here 's an example of when things go wrong on the Mon . Engineer 's side and signals no longer work : URL_0 I 've learned from some of the best in the industry , and they 've told me that dealing with GnR is like a death sentence .",
      "I 'm pretty sure it 's their own self singing so they do n't mess up on the feedback from the stadium . Like if you ever spoke in an auditorium with speakers there 's like a 1 sec delay or even more depending on how large it is . Basically , when you 're several words ahead and then you hear back what you just a couple seconds ago and it throws people off ."

      "Reservoir dams are usually curved towards the lake because it helps to increase their stability.

But if the dam is curved, the forces are distributed more evenly along the length of the dam, which makes it stronger and more stable. \nImagine holding a piece of paper straight up in front of you. If you push down on the top of the paper, it will bend easily. But if you curve the paper slightly, it will be much stronger and harder to bend.

One reason is that our brains are larger and more complex than those of many other animals, and so we have had to trade off some abilities in order to develop others. For example, while we might not have as good a sense of smell as a dog, we have much better language skills and problem-solving abilities. \nAnother reason is that humans have developed other ways of finding food and avoiding danger that do not rely on our sense of smell. For example, we have developed tools and technologies that allow us to hunt and gather food, and we have learned to use our eyes and ears to detect danger. \nSo, while it might be helpful to have a stronger sense of smell in some situations, it is not necessarily the most important sense for human survival. Humans have evolved to be very adaptable and capable of thriving in a wide range of environments, and our senses have evolved to help us do so.",

    "question": "Medieval Nobility How did the system of nobility and peasanthood arise ? How did a family establish itself as ' noble ? ' What powers and responsibilities were granted to those of noble families ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "> How did the system of nobility and peasanthood arise ? It arose in many , many places and even in the same places many times again and again over history . There 's no one answer other than something general like : \" The guy with the most weapons and folks to hold them said it 'd be like that . \" The isle of Great Britain alone has had more kingdoms on it than you could shake a stick at in the past 1500 years , never - mind Europe generally or the whole world . > How did a family establish itself as ' noble ? ' Depends on the realm in question . In some cases the nobility was just about as good as locked down - it was basically never the case that a commoner could become a landowner or holder of titles . In some realms a noble might grant nobility to some degree or another for military accomplishments , or simply because they liked that person . > What powers and responsibilities were granted to those of noble families ? Again , varies realm to realm . A duke , count or whatever might be charged with defending the realm from the other kingdom that bordered their lands . Some were charged with meeting quotas for food harvested or for providing soldiers . Some held the power to , along with the other gentry , select the king or depose him . Some realms had - at least on paper - royal families for all time that could never be deposed or overruled . There have been kingdoms , empires and other realms beyond counting in history , and no two exactly the same .",
      "The vast majority of the people were peasants- people who farmed to feed themselves . As for the nobles , I suspect that in many cases they would 've been conquering invaders whose descendants remained a specialized noble / warrior class . In the period of instability that followed the fall of the Roman Empire , there were opportunities for barbarians to attack peasants , or for groups of warriors to get peasants to give them tribute in return for protection . Then you have a knightly or warrior caste emerging . The Normans are an example . They were Viking invaders who raided France . Then the French king gave some of the Vikings land in return for helping to defend France against other Viking raiders . So the Viking Normans became French nobles . Later on the Normans invaded England from France and defeated the Anglo - Saxons . Then the Normans became the new nobles of England , replacing the older Anglo - Saxon nobility , while the majority of the Anglo - Saxons were still peasants .",
      "Charlemagne basically invented the Feudal system as we know it . He and his tribe were a bunch of badasses , who conquered a lot of land . He wanted to keep control of this land , so he put some of his warriors in charge of the lands . They built forts , collected regular tribute from the locals , and so forth . Over time , other places in Europe copied Charlemagne 's system of oaths of fealty and family lands . More interestingly , this system is * entirely * European . Other cultures created nobility in very different ways . In the Islamic world , for example , nobility was simply a matter of wealth - you owned a lot , and were expected to keep an army to defend what you own . I hope others can tell you more about the Nobility in India , East Asia , and Central America ."

      "The system of nobility and peasanthood, also known as feudalism, developed in medieval Europe around the 9th and 10th centuries. It was a way for lords and kings to organize their lands and the people who lived on them. \nUnder feudalism, lords granted land to nobles in exchange for their loyalty and military service. These nobles, also known as vassals, owed the lord a certain amount of service, such as fighting in wars or providing soldiers for the lord's army. In return, the lord protected the noble and their land. \nTo become a noble, a family had to be granted land by a lord or king. They could also inherit noble status from their parents. Nobles had certain powers and responsibilities, such as the right to collect taxes from the peasants who lived on their land and the responsibility to provide justice for those peasants. They were also expected to serve the lord and participate in wars if needed. \nIn summary, the system of nobility and peasanthood was a way for lords and kings to divide their lands and the people who lived on them. Nobles were granted land in exchange for their loyalty and military service, and they had certain powers and responsibilities as a result.",

    "question": "What is the relationship between resolution ( pixels ) and the dimensions of a printed photo ? In other words : \" How big of a poster could I make with a 12 megapixel photo without losing quality ? \" Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "The measurement you are looking for is dots - per - inch , or DPI . Let 's use some easy numbers ... Imagine you had a picture that was 1,000 x 1,000 pixels . That picture would actually contain 1 million pixels , or what modern marketing called 1 megapixel . If you tried to print it 10 \" x 10 \" , you would have 100 dots per inch ( 1,000 dots / 10 inches = 100 dots per inch ) . On the other hand , if you tried printing a 5 \" x 5 \" print , you would have 200 dots per inch and the picture would look much clearer . Ideally , you want at least 300 dots per inch for quality prints . Since real images are rarely square , you have to choose one dimension to work with , usually the width . A 12 - megapixel image is usually 4368 ( wide ) by 2912 ( height ) pixels . So , if you want to print a 4x6 , you end up with 4368 / 6 = 728 DPI ( measured by width ) That is about double the quality that you actually need to print . To answer your question , you can work the other way , too , with some algrbra . If 300 DPI is acceptable to you : 4368 / x = 300 DPI 300x = 4368 x = 14.5 \" And since y = 2/3 x , y = 9.7 \" So , maintaining a minimum of 300 DPI , the biggest picture you could print is 14.5 \" x 9.7 \" You could print it larger with lower quality , and the smaller you print it , the better it would look . On the other hand , if your printer prints at 300 or 360 DPI maximum , having a picture with more detail will not help . That turned into a long answer ! Hope it helps ...",
      "The typical rule of thumb is to not go lower than 300 DPI . Typically a 12 megapixel image is 4000x3000 which would translate to a 13.3 \" X 10 \" image with little to no loss is quality . You can go larger than this but you will be sacrificing some quality .",
      "How far will the poster be from a normal viewing distance ? 200DPI is good for a poster , even 150DPI is fine . A 15x20 will look perfect at a normal viewing distance ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "The resolution of a photo, measured in pixels, refers to the number of tiny dots that make up the image. The more pixels there are, the higher the resolution and the more detail the photo will have. The dimensions of a printed photo, on the other hand, refer to the size of the print in inches or centimeters. \nSo, to answer your question, the size of the poster you can make with a 12 megapixel photo without losing quality depends on the print resolution that you use. If you print the photo at a high resolution, you will be able to make a larger poster without losing quality. If you print the photo at a lower resolution, the poster will still be the same size, but the image may not be as sharp and clear as it could be. \nFor example, if you want to make a poster that is 24 inches by 36 inches and you want to print it at a high resolution, you will need a photo with a lot of pixels, such as a 12 megapixel photo. On the other hand, if you only want to make a small poster, say 8 inches by 10 inches, you could use a photo with a lower resolution, such as a 5 megapixel photo, and it would still look good. \nSo, in general, the bigger you want to print your photo, the more pixels you will need to maintain good quality.",

      "A Clockwork Orange does n't have a \" message \" , it 's a dystopian story and character study on Alex . I do n't think the film presents his actions as good , or anything other than \" unbridled lust / rage \" at all . The film asks questions about how far it is ethical to go to \" fix \" people . In the film , Alex is forcibly rehabilitated with classical conditioning , forcing him to go through extreme pain for a very long period of time , with the end result of one of his favorite things in the world ( classical music ) being physically painful for him , because it was part of the technique used to torture him and make him \" better \" .",

      "A Clockwork Orange is one of my favorite movies ever . I like it for both the aesthetics and the allegorical plot . Aesthetically , the movie is gorgeous . The colors pop and every shot is planned - out and attractively - arranged . Stanley Kubrick was very good at this . The movie is set in a near - future Communist dystopia and the set dressings themselves added to this without being silly or verging into Road Warrior territory . All those weird words Alex keeps saying ; they 're bastardized Russian . I love the look of Alex and his droogs . Rewatching the movie now still evokes the \" cool to 13 - year - old me \" feeling I got the first time I saw the film . The other costumes are great as well : Alex and the girls in the music shop , Alex 's parents , the writer 's wife ... these contrast with the more straight characters in the truancy officer and prison officials . I also enjoy the moral quandaries presented in the movie . Even at 13 , I saw in Alex and the Droogs the same light as the school bullies of my youth . Some had been raised in abusive homes , others grew up in legitimately - dangerous neighborhoods ( Pontiac or Detroit ) . Despite these scarring pasts , bullies were also frequently just selfish assholes . So , in Alex 's case , to what degree was his antisociality a part of his dystopian upbringing and surroundings and to what degree was he just a sociopath ? By illustrating a potential way for a society to deal with its \" incurable \" sociopaths brings to light the question of \" how do we deal with such people in our society ? \" In our world , we just lock them up in prison and throw away the key . In the film , society tries to rehabilitate Alex ( the robbing , wino - beating , raping , murderer ) with the goal of releasing him back into society in a condition where he wo n't commit other crimes . To what degree might this be a valuable thing for our society ? To what ends might we allow ourselves to go to rehabilitate prisoners rather than just locking them up ? In the film , Alex gives his consent for the treatments , though from prison . To what degree is this consensual and to what degree is it based on a difference in power ? In our world , we might not do such extreme experiments on prisoners , but we can apply that question to other relationships where there is an imbalance of power . On a final , lighter note , the soundtrack ! Wendy Carlos was one of the pioneers of electronic music and the Moog synthesizer she used contained elements she built herself . The soundtrack of famous classical pieces performed on the new(ish ) medium of the electronic synthesizer provides a startling contrast ."

      "A Clockwork Orange is a novel written by Anthony Burgess and later adapted into a film directed by Stanley Kubrick. The story follows the life of a young man named Alex, who is a delinquent and enjoys committing acts of violence and crime. He is eventually arrested and undergoes an experimental form of rehabilitation that aims to cure him of his violent tendencies. \nThe fuss around A Clockwork Orange is due to the controversial themes and ideas that it explores. One of the main themes of the novel and film is the nature of free will and the consequences of trying to control or manipulate it. The story raises questions about whether it is ethical to try to change someone's behavior through means such as brainwashing, and whether it is possible to truly reform someone who has engaged in violent or criminal behavior. \nAnother theme of the story is the idea that true freedom involves the ability to choose between good and evil, and that taking away this choice removes an essential aspect of what makes us human. The novel and film also explore the theme of the dangers of a society that becomes too focused on order and control, and the potential for this to lead to a loss of personal freedom and individuality. \nOverall, the message of A Clockwork Orange might be seen as a cautionary tale about the dangers of trying to control or manipulate people's behavior, and the importance of preserving individual freedom and choice.",

    "question": "Why is n't it considered corruption when politicians grant access to lobbyists in return for financial gain . EDIT : Since lobbyists give campaign donations and receive access to politicians in return , why is n't this considered corruption ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Hi- I 've been a registered lobbyist in the US so I can give you a perspective different than most of the others here . First , when a lobbyist gives money , they 're probably not giving their own money . Instead , they they are giving money from a Political Action Committee which collects money from other donors . Corporations can also have corporate PACs . This is important because lobbyists are speaking on behalf of others . In the US there is a constitutional right to petition government . Donating to political campaigns is also recognized an as expression of free speech . The US also has a strong tradition of legal representation -- Americans generally want a lawyer to advise them on issues in the courtroom whereas in some other , often authoritarian countries , you do n't have that luxury and are forced to navigate a complex legal system you do nt understand by yourself . So when a lobbyist donates money to a politicians campaign , they are ( 1 ) assisting donors to exercise their freedom of speech and ( 2 ) assisting donors to petition their government . Lobbyists are specialists , just like plumbers or lawyers . They understand the byzantine way that a government works and they can provide expert advice about what is realistic , what is ethical and how to accomplish a goal . So , now the question is , does money equal access . The answer , based on a long history of studies is -- yes . Money does get you access . But you can also get access when you do n't give money . And you can be ignored even if you do give money . Getting in the door is really hard and really important . I ca n't tell you how many hours I 've spent just trying to figure out how to get into a room . That said , getting into a room does n't get you anything more than face time . I 've sat across a coffee table from members of congress who loathed the group I represented . Being in their presence did n't get me anything ( other than making conservative members of my group happy that i reached out ) . I do not agree that corruption is getting in the room . It does n't actually get you anything . Getting something is ... well ... getting something . And yes , you do see that some companies are able to getting everything that they want from certain members of congress , but the reality is that * * they were bought and sold before they even ran for office . * * Another thing -- if you talk to lobbyists , a large percentage , i 'd say half , will say that money really does ruin politics . I personally believe in 100 % public financed campaigns and a prohibition on any contribution or in kind contribution . It will never happen , and the reason is not because politicians wo n't let it happen . The reason is that the public wo n't let it happen . Politicians are n't any different than anyone else . They 're just a reflection that people do n't like to see .",
      "It is considered to be corrupt by a lot of people , in fact that s the definition of corruption , although the government wo n't admit it .",
      "Short answer : it depends on the country . I try to answer this without bringing my own opinion into it : Most countries have some forms you could ( depending on your opinions ) call legal corruption . For example : some democracies have non - professional parliaments - that means that the law - makers have their own job and business and only go to the parliament twice a year or so ( Switzerland would be an example for such a system ) . This means , of course , that these politicians have economical interests . You could argue , that this is some kind of corruption , since these guys will vote for their interests . On the other hand , people who vote them into the parliament know this . A teacher might vote for another teacher and a farmer for another farmer - since they know they will have roughly the same interests . In the US it is legal to donate for political campaigns - but you have to do so un - anonymously . So you are free to see , who finances Obama and who finances Romney . So the idea would be , that you could look up the donators which would tell you , which interests the politician will represent . This is true for most countries and most countries regulate this process in some forms ."

      "Lobbying is a legitimate way for businesses, organizations, and individuals to try to influence decisions made by government officials, such as lawmakers. Lobbyists may give campaign donations to politicians in order to gain access to them and present their viewpoints on issues that are important to them. While this type of activity may be seen as potentially influencing a politician's decision-making, it is not necessarily considered corruption. \nCorruption is generally defined as the abuse of power or position for personal gain. In the context of lobbying, if a politician were to grant special favors or take specific actions in exchange for campaign donations or other forms of personal gain, that would be considered corruption. However, simply receiving campaign donations and allowing lobbyists to present their viewpoints does not necessarily constitute corruption. It is important for politicians to be transparent about their interactions with lobbyists and to disclose any campaign donations they receive in order to ensure that the process is fair and aboveboard.",

    "question": "Why do drugs make our eyes look different ? why do we experience dilated pupils , red eyes , glossy eyes , low eyes ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "It depends on what the drug is . Cannabis , for example , causes blood vessels in your eyes to expand slightly , which makes them more visible . Some people also get it from mild allergies to something in the plant . Drugs that cause increases of seratonin levels ( cocaine , LSD , MDMA ) cause dilation . Seratonin stimulates the 5 - HT2A receptor . It has an inhibitory effect on areas in your visual cortex . I suspect its inhibiting the ability of the sphincter muscles that constrict your iris to work . More simply , drugs like LSD cause a bunch of a chemical to pool in your brain that shuts of the iris constriction muscles . Some drugs increase norepinephrine levels , including cocaine and meth . This stimulates the sympathetic nervous system , causing the \" fight or flight \" response . One of these responses is the dilation of the pupils . This uses the iris dilator muscle , which does the opposite of the sphincter muscle and pushes the iris open . Opiates cause pupil constriction . I ca n't find the exact mechanism , but I believe it stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system , which is sorta like the opposite of the \" fight or flight \" response . I also just found that dextromethorphan ( DXM ) acts on the parasympathetic nervous system , so I would also expect it to cause constriction , though I do n't know for sure . Glassy eyes are caused by drugs that depress the central nervous system . One reason this happens is that you blink less if your nervous system gets turned down . This appearance is exacerbated by pupil dilation . ELI5 summary : Red eyes are caused by blood vessel expansion . Dilation is caused either by the brain shutting down the constriction muscles or by turning on the dilation muscles , depending . Constriction is caused by the brain activating the constriction muscles . Glassy eyes are caused by eyes drying out and pupil dilation .",

      "Sure! When you take drugs, they can affect the way your body works and feels. Different drugs can have different effects on your body, including your eyes. \nDilated pupils: Pupils are the small, black circles in the center of your eyes that control how much light enters your eyes. When you take certain drugs, your pupils may get bigger, or dilated. This is because the drug is affecting the muscles around your pupils, causing them to relax and open wider. \nRed eyes: Some drugs can make your eyes red because they can cause blood vessels in your eyes to become larger and more visible. This can also happen if you smoke certain drugs, like marijuana. \nGlossy eyes: Glossy eyes can happen when a person takes drugs that cause their eyes to feel dry or produce less tears. Without enough tears, the surface of the eye may look glossy or shiny. \nLow eyes: Low, or droopy, eyes can happen when a person takes drugs that relax the muscles around their eyes. This can cause the eyelids to feel heavy and droop down. \nIt's important to remember that drugs can have many different effects on the body and can be dangerous to use.

      "Ok first question : Everything has a gravitational pull . Not just planets . You have a gravitational pull and so does your cat and your socks . Everything with mass is constantly pulling on everything else with Mass no matter how far they are . If they are n't moving fast enough to counteract the force pulling them together then they eventually collide and form a larger object with a greater pull . This continues to happen until you get planets . In some cases the planets get so massive that their gravitational pull is stronger than the forces keeping atoms far apart and then the sun will collapse into a black hole . Second question : > There are three main sources of heat in the deep earth : ( 1 ) heat from when the planet formed and accreted , which has not yet been lost ; ( 2 ) frictional heating , caused by denser core material sinking to the center of the planet ; and ( 3 ) heat from the decay of radioactive elements .",

    "generated_answer": [
      "Sure! So, planets form from the leftover material that was left over after the sun formed. This material was made up of gas, dust, and small rocks. When the sun formed, it was so hot that it blew most of the gas away, but some of the dust and small rocks stuck together because of their own gravitational pull. \nAs more and more of these small pieces stuck together, they formed bigger and bigger clumps. Eventually, these clumps became big enough to be called planets. The bigger the planet, the stronger its gravitational pull, which is why it can hold onto more material and grow even bigger. \nThe core of a planet is hot because it is made up of very heavy elements, such as iron and nickel, which are denser and heavier than the other materials that make up the planet. When the planet was forming, these heavy elements sank to the center of the planet and formed the core. The heat in the core comes from the pressure of all of the material above it, as well as the heat that was generated when the planet was forming. \nI hope that helps!

    "generated_answer": [
      "Prescribed burns are a way of intentionally setting fire to a specific area in a controlled and planned manner. They are often used as a tool for managing forests and grasslands. \nThere are several reasons why prescribed burns can be good for the environment: \n1. Prescribed burns can reduce the risk of uncontrolled wildfires. Wildfires can be extremely destructive and dangerous, and they can be difficult to control once they start. By conducting prescribed burns, land managers can reduce the amount of dry, dead vegetation that can fuel a wildfire, which can help to prevent future fires from spreading out of control. \n2. Prescribed burns can improve habitat for wildlife. Many plants and animals depend on fire to maintain their habitats. For example, some plants have seeds that only germinate after a fire, and some animals rely on the open, grassy areas created by burns for foraging and nesting. \n3. Prescribed burns can improve the health of forests and grasslands. Over time, dead plants and debris can build up on the forest floor, which can make it difficult for new plants to grow. Prescribed burns can help to clear out this debris, which can allow new plants to take root and thrive. \n4. Prescribed burns can also help to improve air quality. When vegetation is burned, it releases smoke and other particles into the air. While this can be a concern for air quality in the short term, prescribed burns are typically conducted in a way that minimizes the amount of smoke produced, and they can help to reduce the amount of pollutants that build up in the air over time. \nI hope this helps to explain the benefits of prescribed burns. It's important to remember that they are a tool that is used by land managers to help manage and protect natural areas, and they can have many positive impacts on the environment.",

      "It is not uncommon for people, regardless of their sexual orientation, to find depictions of consensual sexual activity between adults to be arousing or exciting. This is often due to a combination of factors such as the visual appeal of the people involved, the intimacy and connection that can be portrayed in a sexual encounter, and the novelty or uniqueness of the particular situation. It is also worth noting that people's individual preferences and fantasies can vary widely and are not necessarily tied to their own sexual orientation or identity. It is important to remember that it is never okay to objectify or fetishize any group of people, and that everyone should be treated with respect and consent.",

      "In the United States, it is common for stores to require customers to show identification (ID) when purchasing certain over-the-counter (OTC) medications, such as Nyquil and acetaminophen, if they appear to be under a certain age. This is because some OTC medications contain ingredients that can be harmful if taken in large amounts or if taken by certain age groups. For example, Nyquil contains a sedating ingredient called diphenhydramine that can cause drowsiness and should not be taken by people under the age of 12. Acetaminophen is generally safe to take, but taking too much can cause liver damage, so it is important to follow the dosing instructions on the label. \nIf you are under the age of 18 and in need of medication, you should talk to your parent or guardian about getting the appropriate treatment. If you are unable to do so, you can consider seeking medical attention from a healthcare professional, such as a pharmacist or a doctor. They may be able to provide you with the medication you need or suggest alternative treatment options. \nIn summary, it is important to follow the age recommendations for OTC medications to ensure your safety and to avoid potential harm. If you are under the age of 18 and need medication, you should talk to a trusted adult or healthcare professional for help.",

    "question": "How Can Headphones or Speakers Pick Up Radio Waves ? as seen here : URL_0 Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "An antenna is just a metal wire that electrically \" resonates \" when hit with radio waves of a particular frequency . The wire in that person 's headphones just happen to pick up the frequency of a nearby radio station . Wires are covered in rubber ( which blocks the signal ) to stop this from happening , but apparently that 's not working in this case .",
      "Remember how in your middle / high school science class they taught you how if a wire gets close to a magnetic field it can induce a current ? Well ... guess what radio waves are ? They 're a magnetic field that fluctuates in reaction to a sound source , like say a microphone . A radio antenna is just a long thin wire that 's sensitive enough to get a current when the radio waves hit it . Your radio then amplifies that current and pumps it in to a speaker , and since it 's fluctuating the same way the original wave was , the speaker ends up making the same noises the microphone captures on the other end . You know what else has a long thin wire hooked up to an amplifier and some speakers ? Your headphones . Electrically speaking your headphones / speakers are extremely similar to a radio - the only differences is that a ) you have no apparatus for tuning the frequency and b ) the headphones are usually receiving a stronger signal that overpowers any radiowaves that get picked up ( ie , the computer or whatever that you have the headphones plugged in to ) . Every now and then you get lucky ( or unlucky ) and radio waves DO overpower the local signal for whatever reason , and that 's when you hear radio in your ears . Nicer headphones / speakers get around this by using proper shielding on their cables - basically a light foil that 's wrapped around inside the insulation and blocks any radio waves from hitting the actual wires . However , even with shielding a sufficiently strong signal might still get through . For example , if I accidentally leave my cell phone too closer to my speakers I 'll sometimes audibly hear my text messages go out .",
      "Speakers are essentially a loop of wire next to a magnet . running a current through the wire creates an electromagnet which is attracted to or repulsed by the magnet . Which is what makes the speaker move and create sound . A radio signal can be picked up by any wire , converting to electricity in the wire ( that is how an antenna works ) . So a radio signal , if strong enough , will create an electric current in the wire in the speaker , making a sound . That is why for example speakers makes a noise if you call someone on your mobile phone too close to a speaker . In the case of your link , that is a microphone , which is kind of a speaker in reverse . The thing is that the electric current generated in a normal microphone is really weak . So it 's amplified a lot in the computer for it to be heard . But as I explained , every wire is essentially an antenna , so the wire between your headset and computer will pick up radio signals . I 'm guessing the guy lives really close to the radio station if he can actually hear what it picks up and not just get noise . I had a similar problem when I got an extension cord for my microphone . It made it completely useless as the longer cord picked up a lot of static ."

      "Sure! Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation, just like light or heat. Electromagnetic radiation is a type of energy that travels through the air (and through space) as a wave. \nRadio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation that travels through the air at the speed of light. They have a longer wavelength than other types of electromagnetic radiation, such as visible light or X-rays. Radio waves are used to transmit information, such as music or news, through the air from one place to another. \nHeadphones and speakers are able to pick up radio waves because they have a small device inside called a radio receiver. The radio receiver is made up of tiny electronic components that are able to detect radio waves and convert them into an electrical signal. When the electrical signal is sent to the speakers, they use it to produce sound waves that we can hear. \nSo, to sum it up: radio waves are a type of energy that travels through the air and can be picked up by a radio receiver inside headphones or speakers, which converts the radio waves into an electrical signal that the speakers use to produce sound waves that we can hear.

    "question": "What gives atoms their various properties ? Glancing at the period table I can discern no pattern . Can you predict what behaviour an atom will have because of the balance of subatomic particles in the system ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Yes , broadly speaking . Atoms gain their properties due to their valence . Learning about this is basically most of the first semester of a college chemistry course , but the short version is : Atoms are basically clouds of electrons surrounding a core of protons and neutrons . The clouds of electrons behave in a way that is random , but overall very predictable , and they try to form a pattern that resembles a shell of electrons composed of sets of four pairs to make an octet . Bigger atoms have many shells of eight , smaller ones may have only one ( or fewer than one complete shell ) but it 's only the outermost shell that really matters for bonding and chemical properties . When two elements bond , they share an electron or two to fulfil their octets . Different atoms as you go down a row of the periodic table have different numbers of valience electrons in their outermost shell . These are what make atoms react differently . Lithium , sodium , potassium , etc , have one atom in their outermost valience shell - that means they want to bond very much with something that can fill their shell . If you put sodium in water , it rips the water apart , and causes an explosion as the oxygen and hydrogen heat up . Likewise , flourine , chlorine , iodine , etc , all have seven electrons in their outer shell - they want badly to fill with things with only one electron , like hydrogen . That 's why these elements can make such powerful acids - it 's very easy for them to steal a hydrogen from water . Carbon has four electons . It ( and silicon , to a lesser degree ) is the whore of the elemnts . It loves to bond with a lot of stuff becuase there 's so many ways it can make pairs . Oxygen has six , so it loves to double bond ( share two pairs of electrons ) with carbon , or one each with hydrogen ( to make water . ) Finally the nobel gasses come complete with eight already . That 's why they hardly ever bond with * anything * . There 's more to this explanation than just that - radioactivity , transition elements , metals , different levels of valence shells , different types of bonds , subatomic forces , resonance , etc , but that is basically an entire chem course worth of information . But valence electrons are the most important thing overall .",
      "The periodic table is full of patterns . The ' magic numbers ' of chemistry are * 2 * 2 + 6 = 8 * 2 + 6 + 10 = 18 * 2 + 6 + 10 + 16 = 36 * 2 + 6 + 10 + 16 + 18 + 18 = 54 * 2 + 6 + 10 + 16 + 18 + 18 + 18 = 86 Electrons travel in ' shells ' and it takes 2 to fill the first shell , 6 to fill the second , 10 to fill the third , 16 to fill the fourth , and 18 to fill shells the fifth / sixth / seventh shells . Atoms strongly ' like ' to have perfectly filled shells . If need be , they 'll share , give , or take electrons from other atoms to get perfectly filled shells . ----- The rightmost column made of Noble Gases . They already have perfect shells . For the most part , Noble Gas atoms do n't react with other atoms . The left - most column is alkali metals . They have perfect shells plus one extra electron . They readily give away this extra electron to drop down to having perfect shells . Atoms in the left column tend to go ' boom ' in water . ( Look up sodium and water videos on YouTube . ) Carbon is part of column 14 . At 6 , carbon is 4 away from the magic number in the right hand column . Carbon needs a whopping 4 electrons to get to shell perfection , and makes all sorts of electron swaps to get there . Since carbon can make four electron swaps , it can make a huge number of compounds and is one of the key ingredients in the complex chemicals that make life possible . Column 11 is copper , silver , and gold . These are all easy - to - shape metals that conduct electricity . They 're all commonly used in electronic devices .",

      "Atoms are made up of three types of subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. The number of protons in an atom's nucleus determines what element the atom is. For example, all atoms with 6 protons are carbon atoms, all atoms with 8 protons are oxygen atoms, and so on. \nThe properties of an atom are determined by the arrangement of its electrons. The electrons are arranged in shells around the nucleus, and each shell can hold a certain number of electrons. The outermost shell is called the valence shell, and the number of electrons in the valence shell determines how the atom will behave. \nIf an atom has a full valence shell, it is stable and not very reactive. Atoms that have only a few electrons in their valence shell, on the other hand, are more reactive because they want to gain more electrons to fill their valence shell. This is why some elements, like sodium and chlorine, are very reactive: they have only one or a few electrons in their valence shells and are eager to gain or lose those electrons to become more stable. \nSo to sum up: the number of protons in an atom's nucleus determines what element it is, and the arrangement of electrons around the nucleus determines the atom's properties.",

    "human_answer": [
      "Historically , in Medieval Europe only Jews could loan people money because the Church ( there was only one church back then , the Catholic Church ) forbade Christians from usury ( loaning people money and getting a return through charging interest ) . Thus many Jewish people rose to positions of influence in the economy and politically because they could lend merchants and lords money in order to trade and fight wars respectively . This has been a cause of resentment for centuries and it was and has been used by individuals as a means to build up antipathy against Jews . That is the historical origin of much of the animosity against the Jewish people in the West , however there has been discrimination against them for a very long time .",
      "In Medieval Europe , Jews were restricted from various activities like owning land , which forced them from agrarian / farming / serf type jobs into cities and towns with jobs that would today be considered \" white collar . \" Additionally , the church prevented christians from loaning money with interest ( usury ) , so Jews were left the very profitable banking industry . A great example would be the Rothschilds , a European banking family , widely considered to be one of the richest families ever . For a more in depth look explanation , go here - URL_0",
      "The historical reasons that the people have mentioned are very true , but they are not the only reason . Jewish culture is very strong , even across continents people have things in common , and years of discrimination have caused Jews to band together and make themselves useful . This is both the very issue that leads to so much discrimination , and the issue that keeps many Jews safe ; by making themselves essential to a community , they ensure that they can not be gotten rid of , but they will also garner a lot of resentment . So it 's kind of double - edged . More recently , Jewish culture is also very supportive of itself , establishing organizations all around the world in order to help other Jews . The culture puts a lot of emphasis on scholarly pursuit / education ( which is why there are so many Jewish philosophers ) , and shared values between Jews also means that Jews are more likely to view each other as family , and thus help each other out . This provides an effective safety net for Jews who want to ' rise to the top ' . As for Hollywood and comedy stereotypes , which are kind of true to an extent ( just check out the statistics of how much of those industries are Jewish ) , it has been shown in the past that people deal with difficult histories and events through humor , and so humor is a very strong part of Jewish culture as well . Another historical point : The Protocols of the Elders of Ziyon is a forged account of top Jewish leaders taking minutes of meetings planning how best to take over the world , it was naturally fabricated in order to villainize the Jews and is taken seriously by many people all over the world . I have had it quoted at me . I 'm not sure who wrote it , I believe it was written in Russia , but it was widely publicized by the Nazis and even Henry Ford . The publication did not say anything that people had n't been thinking for many years , and so it was n't actually very original , but it was very influential ."

    "question": "How are programming bugs made ? Everytime I searched for this question , I kept getting questions about actual bugs ... Anyways , as someone with pretty much 0 programming knowledge , how are bugs made ? Why is it so difficult to create something without bugs ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "There are different types of bugs that can come about in different ways . Here are a few examples : - The user enters something in a format which the programmer had n't expected - There is a particular combination of events which , individually , work fine , but when combined cause the program to take a path which the programmer had n't thought of - Something external - some hardware , or a database , for example - returns an unexpected value to the program - The program works for a finite amount of time or a finite amount of data , but crashes after some arbitrary limit is reached - The programmer made a typo . ( Most of these will be picked up by the compiler because they will result in what is called a \" syntax error \" , but some of them , if they are syntactically correct , will compile ok . ) - The programmer implemented the design as per the specification , but the specification was wrong I 'm sure there are more , these are just the first ones that spring to mind .",
      "Professional software engineer here . The most common types of bugs are : 1 . A logic error . These are most often just mistakes made by the programmer . The mistake might be because the programmer had a momentary lapse of concentration or because they did n't quite understand something . For example , testing that two things are equal when the test should have been if they are * not * equal . 2 . Lack of or poor error handling . For almost everything that can be done in software , there are at least 3 other ways in which that might go wrong . Trying to write to a new file , for example , might fail if a file with that name already exists , if there are permission problems , if the disk is full or a quota is exceeded , if another program is simultaneously trying to write to the same file , if the file system has become corrupt , if the system is running out of memory and a whole host of other things . Handling these cases is an important part of writing a program , but because many of them rarely happen in practice and programmers can be lazy , they 're not handled correctly or at all . So most of the time the program works fine , but on the rare occasion when the disk is full , for example , the program does n't properly check for and handle that error and does something unexpected . 3 . Mismatching expectations from different programmers . Often programs contain code written by more than one programmer , and these different pieces of code must work together . Well engineered software is broken down into separate independent components that can be independently designed , implemented and tested . Sometimes when two components that appear to work fine independently are used together , something goes wrong . They might both be stepping on each other 's feet by fighting over the same resource or one might try to use the other , but expect it to work slightly differently from how it actually does . 4 . The programmer makes assumptions that are not necessarily true . They might be true on the programmer 's own system where the program works fine , but if the program is run on a different system , it might fail because the assumptions are no longer valid . For example , they might assume that another program is already installed , or that the OS is installed to the C:\\ drive .",

The biggest you get , the more unlikely it gets . Actually , one could say that a story with no inconsistencies is impossible . It is the nature of a story to sometimes trump expectations .

      "Programming bugs, also known as software bugs, are mistakes that are made by programmers while writing code. These mistakes can cause the program to behave unexpectedly or not work at all. \nThere are many ways that bugs can be introduced into a program. For example, a programmer might forget to include an important line of code, or might use the wrong type of data in a calculation. Sometimes, bugs are caused by mistakes in logic, where the programmer has written code that doesn't do what they intended it to do. \nIt can be difficult to create something without bugs because programming is a complex task that involves many steps and requires attention to detail. It is easy to make mistakes when writing code, especially if the programmer is working on a large and complex program. In addition, it is often difficult to test all possible scenarios and combinations of inputs to a program, so it is possible for bugs to remain hidden until the program is being used in the real world. \nTo reduce the number of bugs in a program, programmers often use techniques such as testing, debugging, and code reviews to identify and fix problems before the program is released. However, it is still possible for bugs to slip through and be discovered after the program is in use.",

    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "There are a few reasons why veterinarians usually prefer to neuter animals (i.e., remove their testicles) rather than performing a vasectomy (i.e., cutting the vas deferens to block the flow of sperm). \nFirst, a vasectomy is a more complicated and invasive surgery than neutering. It requires a higher level of surgical skill and specialized equipment, and the recovery period is typically longer for the animal. In contrast, neutering is a relatively straightforward procedure that can often be performed under general anesthesia in a veterinary clinic setting. \nSecond, neutering is more effective at reducing unwanted behaviors in animals, such as aggression, marking territory, and roaming. This is because neutering removes the source of hormones (testosterone) that contribute to these behaviors. A vasectomy, on the other hand, only blocks the flow of sperm and does not significantly reduce the production of hormones. \nFinally, neutering is a more cost-effective option for pet owners, as it is generally less expensive than a vasectomy. \nOverall, while a vasectomy might seem more humane in theory, in practice it is usually a less practical and effective option for preventing unwanted pregnancies and modifying behavior in animals.",

Instead, it is tilted by about 23.5 degrees. \nThe North Pole is the point on the Earth's surface that is directly above the Earth's rotational axis. This is the point that is used to define the direction of \"north.\" \nTrue North, on the other hand, is the direction of the North Pole relative to the surface of the Earth. It is the direction that a compass needle points towards, which is not the same as the direction of the North Pole. This is because the Earth's magnetic field causes the compass needle to be attracted to the Earth's magnetic north pole, which is not exactly the same as the Earth's rotational north pole. \nSo, to sum it up: \"North\" is the direction that is defined by the Earth's rotational axis, and \"True North\" is the direction that a compass needle points towards due to the Earth's magnetic field.

The main cause of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, which releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun and cause the Earth's temperature to rise. \nClimate change, on the other hand, refers to the broader range of changes that are occurring in the Earth's climate, including not only the increase in temperature, but also changes in precipitation patterns, sea level, and other factors. Climate change can be caused by both natural and human factors, and it can have a range of impacts on the environment, including more frequent heatwaves, droughts, and extreme weather events like hurricanes and floods. \nSo, to sum it up, global warming is a specific aspect of climate change, which is a broader term that encompasses a range of changes that are occurring in the Earth's climate.",

The laminated safety glass is designed to stay in one piece even if it cracks or breaks, so it doesn't need a defroster grid to help clear it. \nThe rear window, on the other hand, is usually made of tempered glass, which is a type of glass that shatters into small pieces if it breaks. Tempered glass is used in the rear window because it is stronger and more durable than regular glass, but it is also more prone to fogging up or getting covered in condensation.

Later , after drinking your extra large Floaty Shake , your bladder fills with urine , and sensory nerves alert you to this fact via stretch receptors on the bladder itself . As your bladder fills with more urine , the stretch sensors cause little contractions in the bladder which you feel as urges . When you finally feel like it 's a good time to pee on something , your somatic nerves signal your accessory muscles ( abdominals ) to assist with voiding ( a fancy word for micturition which is an even fancier word for urination ) , and your parasympathetic nerves ( rest / digest ) takes the hint and squeezes the bladder and relaxes your urinary sphincter . The result is pee happening . Several regions in the brain are also involved , mainly keeping you from peeing when you do n't want to pee . You can consciously keep from wetting yourself for quite a while , unless you have some sort of disease where nerves are damaged or the muscles in your bladder ( detrusor muscle and sphincters ) do n't cooperate . Incontinence = ca n't hold it in . Enuresis = bedwetting .",
      "It 's the urinary sphincter not relaxing fast enough , probably due to shyness or tension . Some medications can affect the sphincter causing urinary retention .",
      "I read on here somewhere , some post , about standing at the urinal , lots of dudes standing in line and it just wo nt release .

      "When you feel the urge to urinate, your body is sending a signal to your brain that your bladder is full and needs to be emptied. The bladder is a muscular sac in your pelvis that stores urine until it is ready to be expelled from the body. \nWhen you stand at the toilet and try to urinate, your brain sends a signal to the muscles in your pelvic area to relax, including the muscles that control the bladder. At the same time, the muscles in the wall of your bladder contract, pushing the urine out through the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body). \nSometimes, when you try to urinate, the muscles in your pelvic area may not fully relax, or the muscles in the wall of your bladder may not contract strongly enough. This can make it difficult to start urinating, or to urinate as much as you normally would. This is more common in men, but it can happen to anyone. \nThere are a few things you can try to help you urinate more easily when you're having difficulty: \n1. Take a deep breath and try to relax your muscles. \n2. Try massaging your lower abdomen or stomach area gently. \n3. Drink a glass of water or another fluid. This can help to increase the volume of urine in your bladder, making it easier to start urinating. \n4. Try going back to bed and waiting a little while longer. Sometimes, just waiting a few minutes can help your muscles relax enough to allow you to urinate. \nIf you continue to have difficulty urinating, or if you have other symptoms such as pain or blood in your urine, you should speak with a healthcare provider. They can help to determine the cause of your symptoms and provide treatment if necessary.",

    "question": "Difference between isopropyl alcohol ( \" rubbing alcohol \" ) , ethyl alcohol , and methyl alcohol ? Edit : Thanks guys . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Ethyl alcohol is the kind you drink . It is produced by yeast . . The yeast eat some kind of sugar or starch and turn it into carbon dioxide and alcohol . In wine the process is pretty simple \u00e2\u0080\u0093 yeast eats the sugar in grape juice and creates alcohol . In whiskey , the alcohol is distilled to get the concentration higher . Ethanol that you purchase as a car fuel is the same kind of alcohol found in whiskey , but it has been distilled to the point where it is nearly pure alcohol ( as opposed to whiskey which is typically only 40 % alcohol and 60 % water ) . Methanol is sometimes found in windshield wiper fluid to keep it from freezing , and it is also used as the fuel for Champ cars and Indy cars . It is sometimes called wood alcohol because it used to be made from wood , but today its made from natural gas . Methanol is poisonous , and it is one of the chemicals that can be used to poison denatured alcohol . The chemical difference is how many carbon atoms there are .",
      "They 're different chemicals . An alcohol is a string of carbon atoms that are bonded to hydrogen atoms everywhere except that there 's an ( OH ) in place of a hydrogen atom somewhere . Methanol is the simplest alcohol , consisting of just one carbon atom , 3 hydrogen atoms , and one ( OH ) group . Ethanol is basically the same as methanol , except it has two carbon atoms . Isopropyl alcohol has three carbons , but it 's a little different from methanol and ethanol . Instead of having the ( OH ) group at one end of the molecule , it has it sticking out of the middle . In terms of effects on the human body , they all do similar things . The problem with drinking methanol and isopropanol is that the stuff your body metabolizes them into is quite toxic and can cause a lot of bad stuff to happen . Fortunately , one way to treat overdoses of methanol and isopropanol by getting the person very drunk for a while . Your body prefers to metabolize ethanol over methanol and isopropanol , so staying drunk for a while allows you to get rid of the methanol or isopropanol by breathing , sweating , and urinating it out directly without being turned into bad stuff .",
      "Methyl alcohol has one Carbon atom and one hydroxyl group ( -OH ) . Its chemical formula is CH3 - OH . It is aka \" wood alcohol \" as at one time it was obtained by wood distillation . It is poisonous to drink . It will give the similar mind - altering effects as ethanol ( ethyl alcohol ) , but it will eventually make you go blind . Ethyl alcohol has 2 carbon atoms and one hydroxyl group . Its chemical fomula is C2H5OH ( or CH3 - CH2 - OH ) . It is frequently obtained by the yeast - driven distillation of grains and fruits . It has mind altering effects , but can lead to other medical problems if use is frequent and chronic . It is also often used as a fuel additive . Isopropyl alcohol has 3 carbon atoms and one hydroxyl group , with the hydroxyl group attached to the middle carbon atom . Its chemical formula is C3H7OH ( or CH3 - CH(OH)-CH3 ) . It is poisonous to drink . It is used almost exclusively as an industrial solvent or as a medical disinfectant . They are all flammable to various degrees ."

    "human_answer": [
      "According to the dentists : It is worse to continually eat ( all foods , not just sugar ! ) during the day than to eat more during short periods . The reason for this is that your teeth needs to \" rest \" between the meals . This is also why dentists recommend that you wait 20 - 30 min after eating to brush your teeth , otherwise you hurt them instead of cleaning . * quick note though ! Dentists seem to be easily bribed to recommend things !",
      "With your teeth I would n't be too worried about a binge of sugar , the long term effect of sugar ( and other carbs ) on your teeth would be worse than the occasional overdose . However in terms of your pancreas and insulin levels , a small amount of sugar ( and other carbs ) spread out is much better than just pounding sugar cubes .",
      "To touch on what the periodontist said , if one is using proper brushing techniques , it wo n't matter [ too much ] , but there is still a difference . The short answer : sugar all at once is better . Your internal organs wo n't like it , but it 's better for your teeth . The long answer : Sugar , and the by products bacteria in your mouth produce from breaking it down , are acidic . The acid itself , while not beneficial , is n't the only cause of tooth decay in this instance . When your mouth 's PH is out of whack , this affects the rate of production and the effectiveness of the saliva your mouth produces . Why is this important ? Your saliva has something in it called hydroxyaptite that contains phosphate and calcium ions . The concentrations of these ions act as a buffer against tooth decay , but only when their presence in your saliva is at a high enough concentration . Guess what happens the more acidic your mouth becomes ? Its ability to hold hydroxyaptite decreases dramatically , leaving your mouth more vulnerable . So yes , sugar all at once is better . If you buy a Big Gulp soda and sip it over the course of three hours , you 're maintaining a low low PH in your mouth which will dramatically lower your saliva 's ability to fight tooth decay \u00e2\u0080\u0094 moreso than if you 'd just drank the entire thing in 20 minutes ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "It's generally better for your teeth to have sugar in small amounts rather than all at once. That's because sugar can cause tooth decay, which is a process that happens when bacteria in your mouth use sugar from the foods you eat to make acids. These acids can attack your tooth enamel, which is the hard outer layer of your teeth. If the enamel gets weak or wears away, it can lead to cavities. \nWhen you eat or drink something with sugar in it, the bacteria in your mouth start making acid right away. The more sugar you eat or drink, the more acid they can make. So if you eat or drink a lot of sugar all at once, your teeth will be exposed to a lot of acid at once, which can be harmful. \nOn the other hand, if you have small amounts of sugar throughout the day, your teeth will be exposed to acid for a longer period of time, but the amount of acid they're exposed to at any given moment will be smaller. This can be less harmful to your teeth. \nIt's also important to remember to brush your teeth twice a day and floss once a day to help remove sugar and plaque from your teeth. Plaque is a sticky film of bacteria that can build up on your teeth and cause tooth decay. \nSo, to sum up: it's better for your teeth to have sugar in small amounts rather than all at once, and it's important to brush and floss your teeth to help protect them from sugar and plaque.",

    "generated_answer": [
      "There are several reasons why prescription drugs may be more expensive in the United States compared to other countries. \nOne reason is that the prices of prescription drugs are often higher in the United States because the manufacturers of those drugs can charge more. These higher prices may be due to the high cost of researching and developing new drugs, as well as the cost of marketing and selling them. \nAnother reason is that the government in the United States does not regulate the prices of prescription drugs as closely as it does in other countries. In other countries, the government may negotiate with drug manufacturers to get lower prices for prescription drugs, or it may regulate the prices of drugs to make them more affordable for people. In the United States, the government does not have this power, so drug manufacturers can set the prices of their drugs at whatever level they choose. \nFinally, the United States has a complex system for paying for prescription drugs, which can also contribute to higher prices. Insurance companies, pharmacies, and drug manufacturers all play a role in determining the final cost of a prescription drug, and this can make the pricing process more complicated and expensive. \nSo, to sum it up, prescription drugs may be more expensive in the United States because the manufacturers can charge more, the government does not regulate drug prices as closely, and the system for paying for drugs is complex.",

In other words, the LED bulb is a more energy-efficient way to produce light because it uses less electricity to produce the same amount of light. \nTo understand this better, let's compare how a traditional incandescent bulb and an LED bulb work. An incandescent bulb works by heating a thin wire called a filament until it becomes so hot that it glows and produces light. Because the filament gets so hot, it uses a lot of electricity to produce light. An LED bulb, on the other hand, works by using a semiconductor to convert electricity into light. Because the LED doesn't have to heat anything up to produce light, it uses much less electricity than an incandescent bulb. \nSo when you see 1.2W = 10W on an LED lightbulb, it means that the LED bulb uses 1.2 watts of electricity to produce the same amount of light as a traditional incandescent bulb that uses 10 watts of electricity.

    "human_answer": [
      "There are a few of things that make Chernobyl still far more radioactive than Hiroshima and Nagasaki . First , the bombs actually did n't use very much radioactive material , all things considered . A nuclear reactor consumes much greater quantities of fuel than does a bomb , since the bomb is made to go BOOM and then be done with while the reactor needs a long , energetic , sustained reaction . Second , the fissile material in the atomic bombs was vaporized . I do n't mean that it disappeared , completely , but I mean was turned into plasma in the explosion . This pushed it much higher in the atmosphere and spread out the material over a huge distance . Without large concentrations , what little radioactive decay takes place over time ( remember that U235 and P239 have fairly long half lives and do n't release a ton of highly energetic particles when they do decay ) quickly became nominal compared to the standard background radiation . Third , very little of the fuel actually turned into the more dangerous radioactive intermediates . The percentages of the fuel actually consumed in those bombs is minute - more modern nuclear weaponry may leave longer lasting radiation . So that 's what happened in the bomb areas - Big releases of radiation at the time of explosion , but not much retained in the soil and region afterwards . In Chernobyl , on the other hand , large quantities of highly radioactive material were released into the atmosphere because of the heat from the fire generated . This includes radioactive steams ( heavy water ) , irradiated metals , intermediates , large quantities of spent and active fuels , the works . These were concentrated on the town , and were n't largely consumed in a big nuclear boom - most of those materials do n't actually go boom either . As a result of the varying half lives and the extremely large quantities of material in the area , it 's still very radioactive , especially near the core which got a logarithmically greater dose than the surrounding areas .",
      "Firstly , one was a bomb , and the other was a powerplant . With the Hiroshima bomb , the nuclear reaction was a high yield , but quick acting nuclear explosion . Since the Chernobyl was a power plant , it was designed for longer lasting , but small yielding , nuclear reactions . Even after the incident , the nuclear core kept going and going , expelling more and more radiation . It is like a bomb that has been exploding for years rather than for a second .",
      "Chernobyl is n't really uninhabitable . IIRC the other 3 reactors at the power plant stayed operational until 2002 . People went to work shortly after the meltdown and have not died nor developed cancer outside the normal population . The town of Pripyat which was built for the powerplant , is currently inhabited by Ukrainians that moved back shortly after the disaster . And they are doing fine . The radiation levels have dropped of so much that you get more radiation eating a banana or flying on a commercial plain than you do living in Pripyat . This is a very good question , and people more knowledgeable than I will fully answer it for you . It just ( kind of ) grinds my gears that people ( not necessarily you ) think that more than 100k people died at Chernobyl and that its some giant green glowing crater . Check out the documentary Pandora 's Promise , a great film from former anti - nuclear activists who have now fully changed their minds due to thorough science . The majority of the nuclear energy scare was due to most people associating it with bombs , and ( still currently active ) propoganda and lobbying from the fossil fuel industry ."

      "Chernobyl and Hiroshima are two very different places that were affected by radiation in very different ways. \nChernobyl was the site of a nuclear power plant disaster in 1986. A reactor at the plant exploded, releasing a huge amount of radiation into the environment. This radiation made the area around the plant unsafe for people to live in for a long time. \nHiroshima, on the other hand, was the site of an atomic bomb explosion during World War II. While the bomb did release a lot of radiation, it was only released for a very short period of time. The radiation levels in Hiroshima returned to normal relatively quickly, so people were able to go back and live there again. \nThe main difference between the two is the amount and duration of radiation released. In Chernobyl, the radiation was released over a longer period of time and covered a larger area, making it unsafe for people to live there. In Hiroshima, the radiation was released for a very short period of time and only affected a small area, so it was safe for people to return and live there again.",

      "There are a few reasons why police departments might be reluctant to use body cameras. One reason is the cost of purchasing and maintaining the cameras and the associated technology. Body cameras and the infrastructure needed to support them can be expensive, and some police departments may not have the budget to implement a body camera program. \nAnother reason is the potential for privacy concerns. Body cameras record video and audio of everything that happens while they are turned on, and this can include personal conversations and interactions that might be considered private. There are also concerns about how the footage will be stored and who will have access to it. \nFinally, there may be logistical challenges to using body cameras, such as deciding when they should be turned on and off and how to handle footage that is recorded during sensitive or confidential situations. \nOverall, while body cameras can provide protection for police officers by providing a record of their interactions with the public, there are also potential costs and challenges associated with their use.",

      "The cancerous \" rot \" you show below is a result of necrosis where the tumor has grown so much that it no longer get nutrients and oxygen from the blood supply . The cells on the interior of the tumor die . There are two types of cell death : apopotosis , which is tightly regulated , and necrosis , which is unregulated . Unregulated dying , as is the case in tumor rot , causes a cell to release all of its contents onto neighboring cells , causing those cells to necrose as well . This usually results in the entire area to start decomposing , causing secondary bacterial infections and general gross - ness . This is part of the reason why people with necrotising fasciitis ( flesh eating disease ) have to get entire areas of necrosis removed , like arms or legs or whatever to prevent the rot from spreading . Fortunately , in humans cancer rarely gets so bad that you see that extent of rot . Usually the tumor is palpable and can be treated or removed before huge rotting occurs .

      "Cancer is a group of diseases that are characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells in the body. When normal cells divide and grow, they follow a specific pattern that helps the body function properly. But when cancer cells develop, they don't follow this pattern and can grow out of control, forming a mass of tissue called a tumor. \nCancer cells can also spread to other parts of the body, where they can grow and form new tumors. This is called metastasis. When cancer cells spread to other parts of the body, they can interfere with the normal functioning of those organs and tissues, which can cause a variety of symptoms and complications. \nAs cancer cells grow and divide, they can interfere with the normal functioning of the body's tissues and organs. For example, a tumor in the lung may make it difficult for a person to breathe. A tumor in the stomach may cause a person to feel full and have trouble eating. And a tumor in the brain may cause a person to experience headaches and changes in their thinking or behavior. \nIn the later stages of cancer, the tumors may become very large and may begin to interfere with the body's vital functions, such as the ability to breathe or pump blood. The cancer may also spread to other parts of the body, which can lead to additional symptoms and complications. \nCancer can also weaken the body's immune system, making it more difficult for the body to fight off infections and other diseases. This can make a person more susceptible to getting sick and may cause additional complications. \nI hope this helps to explain cancer to you.

      "Cancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow and multiply in an uncontrolled way. When cancer cells form a mass or tumor, it can be treated by surgically removing the tumor. However, cancer cells can also spread, or metastasize, to other parts of the body. In this case, removing the tumor alone may not be enough to cure the cancer. \nFor example, if someone has testicular cancer and the cancer has spread to other parts of their body, such as their lymph nodes or lungs, removing the testicles (a procedure called orchiectomy) would not be sufficient to treat the cancer. In this case, the person would need additional treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, to kill any remaining cancer cells and prevent the cancer from returning. \nIt is important to note that in many cases, testicular cancer is caught early and can be treated with surgery alone.

    "human_answer": [
      "If you 're looking for the anatomical reason , it deals with the Red Blood Cell surfaces . RBCs are the cells that contain hemoglobin , which act to pick up / drop Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide in the blood stream to metabolically support and \" feed \" all of the cells in your body . An antigen is a protein on the surface of a cell that acts as a \" flag \" for the immune system . RBCs in a certain person contain contain types of antigens . In reality , there are thousands of antigens present , but in terms of labeling RBCs , there are 3 important ones : A , B , and D ( Rh ) . A person with a certain antigen of these three would also have blood plasma ( surrounding liquid around RBCs ) containing antibodies ( bind to the antigens ) for the other blood types . For example , a person with Type A blood would have antigens for Type B and D Blood . This is why you ca n't give blood to a person of a different blood type because the antibodies will react with your antigens on your RBCs , causing clumping and apoptosis . The Rh antigen brings the + /- factor that you often see on blood types . If Rh ( D ) is present , the type is + and the plasma contains no Rh antibodies . If Rh is not present on the surface , the type is - and the plasma contains Rh antibodies . Effectively , these are the blood types : A+ : contains A , D antigens and B antibodies A- : contains A antigens and B , D antibodies B+ : contains B , D antigens and A antibodies B- : contains B antigens and A , D antibodies AB+ : contains A , B , D antigens and no antibodies AB- : contains A , B antigens and D antibodies O+ : contains D antigens , and A , B antibodies O- : contains no antigens , and A , B , D antibodies This would make O- the universal donor blood type because the blood cells contain no antigens for which a recipient 's antibodies could react with . AB+ is the universal recipient because it has no antibodies in the plasma that could react with a donor 's blood 's antigens .",
      "I 've learned that it 's an evolutionary mechanism . If the human race only had one bloodtype and someone were to catch a blood - borne disease and begin transmitting it , the entire population would be eliminated .

      "Sure! The different blood types in humans are determined by proteins called antigens that are found on the surface of red blood cells. There are two main antigens: A and B. People can have either A, B, both A and B, or neither A and B. \nIf a person has the A antigen on their red blood cells, they are said to have type A blood. If they have the B antigen, they have type B blood. If they have both A and B antigens, they have type AB blood. And if they don't have either A or B antigens, they have type O blood. \nThe different blood types are important because they can affect whether or not a person can receive certain types of blood transfusions. For example, if a person with type A blood receives a transfusion of type B blood, their body may react to the B antigens and cause serious problems.

    "human_answer": [
      "Imagine writing out a message in your own handwriting , and later printing the same message with your printer . The letter will look wildly different . Your handwriting most likely is unclearer and more messy , but cheaper . Your printer makes everything perfectly clear and understandable , but printer ink is expensive . . AM and FM are separate methods of encoding and broadcasting radio signals . M works by modulating the amplitude of the signal according to the information being sent , while the frequency remains constant . This differs from FM technology in which sound is encoded by varying the frequency of the wave and the amplitude is kept constant . . This difference in signal type is what causes the sounds to change . AM has poorer sound quality compared with FM , but is cheaper and includes lower bandwidth making it ideal for having many stations in a small broadcast range . FM has a sharper quality at the cost of higher bandwidth , but can be blocked by physical hindrances ( mountains or your wall ) making it much shorter range .",
      "While both answers mention that AM has poorer sound quality , neither explain why . The answer ? AM radio is more susceptible to interference than FM radio ( because there is not an easy way to distinguish between noise / interference and the desired signal ) AND the inter - station separation ( space between stations on the radio dial ) between AM radio stations is small enough that the full range of music is limited .",
      "The first thing to understand is what the \" M \" means . The M means \" modulation \" . When a radio station broadcasts ( sends out , transmits , etc ) a signal , it uses what is called a \" carrier wave \" . You ca n't actually hear this signal , as it is a very high frequency ... way higher than your ears can detect . The actual music ( or talking ) is used at the radio station to change the constant nature of the carrier wave . This \" change \" is called modulation . It 's sort of \" mixed in \" . AM radio does this by altering the amplitude ( or volume or power ) of the carrier wave . FM does it by using it to change the frequency ( pitch ) of the carrier wave . Think of a rope tied to a wall . Grab one end of the rope and move your arm up and down . How high ( or low ) your arm gets is AM . Now move your arm up and down * the same distance * but change * how fast * you move your arm . That is FM . In radio , you can \" put more information \" in how fast you move your arm , compared to how high / low you can do it . ( This is called \" bandwidth \" ) In general , more sound information can be put in a typical FM signal , and so it tends to sound better . That 's also why you see stereo broadcasts ( left and right ear channels ) done almost always with FM ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "AM and FM radio signals sound different because they use different methods to transmit information. AM stands for \"amplitude modulation,\" and FM stands for \"frequency modulation.\" \nIn AM radio, the strength or amplitude of the radio signal is used to carry the information, such as music or speech. The signal is sent out at a specific frequency, and the amplitude (or strength) of the signal is changed to transmit the information. \nIn FM radio, the frequency of the radio signal is used to carry the information. The signal is sent out at a specific frequency, and the frequency of the signal is changed slightly to transmit the information. \nBecause AM radio uses changes in the amplitude of the signal to transmit information, it can be more prone to interference from things like electrical storms or other sources of interference. This can make the sound quality of AM radio less clear than FM radio. FM radio, on the other hand, uses changes in the frequency of the signal to transmit information, which makes it less prone to interference and generally gives it better sound quality. \nI hope this helps!

Some people believe that it is possible to train yourself to have lucid dreams, and there are a few different techniques that you can try to increase your chances of having one. \nOne way to train yourself to have a lucid dream is to keep a dream journal. Every morning after you wake up, write down everything you can remember about your dreams from the night before. This can help you become more aware of your dreams and may increase your chances of having a lucid dream. \nAnother technique is to do something called \"reality checking.\" This means that you regularly check during the day to see if you are awake or dreaming. For example, you can try to push your finger through your palm or look at a clock and then look away and look back to see if the time has changed. If you do this enough, you may start doing it in your dreams and realize that you are dreaming. \nThere are also some other techniques that you can try, such as setting an intention to have a lucid dream before you go to sleep, or trying to stay as awake as possible just before you fall asleep. \nOverall, whether or not it is possible to train yourself to have lucid dreams is still a topic of debate, and different people may have different experiences.

      "There 's way , way more that goes into running a large scale website than many people realize . Sure , you need good web designers , but you also need someone who can program the site ( designers might just define the look and feel and tell programmers what it should look like and do ) . Then you need enterprise - grade computer equipment and a place to run that equipment at all times . You need to pay for all the software licenses you 'll need . You need to design , build , and deploy the databases that will be the backend part of your website . You need business people to figure out how you 'll make money with the site . You 'll need marketing people to promote it . You 'll need lawyers to cover the legalese , paperwork , protect the company , etc . On top of all the things you need to run a large business , even just the act of running a large - scale site like a social networking site requires all sorts of expensive technology and expertise . You can make a pretty front - end to a website all day long , but if the site does n't perform well , or crashes frequently , no one will use it . This means you need redundant server deployments with load balancing , failover , etc .",
      "It 's in fact easy to create the site itself , i.e. design and code base . It could realistically take like a month of work of one or two people . Making the site successful is much more difficult . That includes lots of advertising , marketing , promotion campaigns , maintaining and upgrading the site for a long time , etc . Plus the idea should be good enough so people would actually want to use it . For example , Google+ was very well implemented , but nobody wanted to use it , because it was nothing new compared to Facebook .",
      "Most of the money goes into sever capacity . Nobody is going to adopt your new social networking site if it is down most of the time because your servers are overloaded . Additionally , you are also going to need a budget for advertising because nobody will come to your platform if they do n't know about it ."

      "Circumcision is the surgical removal of the skin that covers the tip of the penis, also known as the foreskin. In the United States, circumcision is a common procedure that is often performed on newborn boys for cultural, religious, and personal reasons. \nThere are some potential benefits to circumcision, such as a slightly reduced risk of urinary tract infections, a reduced risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as HIV, and a reduced risk of certain types of cancer of the penis. However, these benefits are generally small and may not outweigh the potential risks and drawbacks of the procedure. \nOn the other hand, there are also potential risks and drawbacks associated with circumcision. The procedure is generally safe when performed by a trained and experienced healthcare provider, but there is a small risk of complications such as bleeding, infection, and scarring. There is also some debate over whether circumcision may affect sexual pleasure or function. Some people argue that circumcision may reduce sensitivity in the penis, while others argue that it has no effect or may even increase sensitivity. \nCircumcision is more common in the United States than in many other countries, partly due to historical and cultural factors. It has been practiced in the United States for over 100 years and is still performed on about 60% of newborn boys in the country. Some people in the United States choose to have their sons circumcised for personal or cultural reasons, while others do it for religious reasons.",

      "VHS tapes, also known as VHS cassette tapes, are a type of magnetic tape that was commonly used for recording and playing back video and audio in the 20th century. They work by using a magnetic head to read and write magnetic signals on the tape. \nWhen you insert a VHS tape into a VHS player, the player's drive motor moves the tape past a series of spinning heads. These heads are magnetically charged and can read the magnetic signals on the tape. As the tape moves past the heads, the signals are converted into an electrical current, which is then amplified and played through the speakers of the VHS player. \nThe audio on a VHS tape is typically recorded in a format called \"analog audio,\" which means that the audio is stored as a continuous, wave-like signal on the tape. This is different from \"digital audio,\" which stores audio as a series of 1s and 0s. When you play a VHS tape, the audio is read from the tape and converted into sound waves that you can hear through the speakers. \nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

This electrical signal is then sent through a wire (or wirelessly, if you are using a wireless microphone) to the computer or other device you are using for the Skype call. The computer processes the electrical signal and converts it back into sound waves, which are then played through the speakers for the other person on the call to hear. \nAt the same time, the other person's voice is also being captured by their microphone and converted into an electrical signal, which is sent to your computer. Your computer processes this electrical signal and plays the sound waves through your speakers so that you can hear the other person. \nThe microphone and the speakers are connected to different parts of the computer or device, so they do not interfere with each other. The microphone is able to pick up sound waves from your voice, but it is not able to pick up the sound waves that are being played through the speakers.

It is based on the idea that people have the right to do what they want as long as they do not harm others. This means that people should be free to make their own choices about how they live their lives, as long as they do not hurt anyone else in the process. \nAnarchism is also a political philosophy, but it takes the idea of individual freedom and liberty even further. Anarchists believe that there should be no government or laws at all. Instead, they think that people should be free to make their own decisions and live their lives however they want, without interference from any authority. \nSo, the main difference between libertarianism and anarchism is that libertarians believe in some limited government, while anarchists believe in no government at all.

It can also help you breathe more efficiently by opening up your airways and allowing you to take deeper breaths. \nSo, it's not necessarily something that people do on purpose \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it's just a natural reaction to the physical effort that your body is experiencing. Some people may not make weird faces at all when working out, while others may do it more often. It's really just a matter of personal preference and how your body reacts to the physical strain.",

    "question": "What Happens In Your Body The Exact Moment You Fall Asleep ? Wow Guys , thanks for all your answers ! ! ! ! I learned so much today ! Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "See , you do n't actually fall asleep all at once . It 's more of a well - defined process that everyone makes their way through in their own time . I 'll attempt to explain it . ----------------------------------------------------------------------- You start off moving into what 's called Stage 1 , from being completely awake . When you first lay down to go to sleep , you pass from your awake state to what 's called Alpha state . You 've daydreamed before , right ? That 's basically Alpha state . You 're still mostly conscious , but you start to see some little bouts of color behind your eyes ( hypnogogic hallucinations ) and you start to feel more relaxed . After Alpha , you enter Theta state . Theta state is when you could technically be considered asleep . This is when you move completely into sleep paralysis ( have you felt like you were falling then woken up with a start ? that 's sleep paralysis setting in and you not being completely unaware when it happened ) . You 're still sleeping relatively lightly , but if you can get through this stage you move into deeper sleep . ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The next major stage of sleep is called Stage 2 . Your brain starts to produce short periods of rapid brain waves that are called Sleep Spindles . This is the precursor to what comes next in sleep , deep sleep . Your body temperature begins to drop and your heart rate slows down , settling you in for the night . ------------------------------------------------------------------------ You then enter Stage 3 . When you enter stage 3 , really slow brain waves called Delta waves start happening . This is the true transition between light and deep sleep . ------------------------------------------------------------------------ You then enter Stage 4 . Stage four is commonly referred to as Delta Sleep because of the brain waves associated with it . It 's a deep sleep that lasts for about thirty minutes . You are the technically the most asleep in this stage . ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Here 's where it gets interesting . There is another stage of sleep unlike all the others . It 's called Stage 5 , or REM sleep . REM stands for Rapid Eye Movement , your eyes literally start moving rapidly behind your eyelids . Your breathing rate increases , and your brain waves shoot up to almost as active as if you were awake . Your voluntary muscles become completely paralyzed , and you start dreaming . REM is also where most of the body 's repairs happen . REM sleep is what makes you feel rested when you wake up , and where the body actually rests and restores itself ( which is why you usually do n't feel rested after a night of drinking or smoking weed , they both inhibit REM sleep ) . ----------------------------------------------------------------------- These stages come in cycles . It takes roughly 90 minutes for you to go from awake into REM . The first cycle typically has a short REM period , but subsequent cycles increase the duration of REM . When we actually fall asleep , we go from stage 1 into 2 , then 3 , then 4 , but here 's where something curious happens . We then go from 4 to 3 , then 3 to 2 , then into REM . After REM , we usually return to stage 2 , then go back to 3 , 4 , then 3 , 2 , REM . We have as many cycles as we stay asleep for , when we wake up , feeling refreshed and ready or the day . ------------------------------------------------------------------------ I do n't know if that answered your question , but I hope it shed some light on the subject . Edit : formatting . Edit 2 : I 'll be here if anyone has any other questions they 'd like answered about this topic . Edit 3 : Holy crap ! Thanks for popping my gold cherry anon ! Much love ! < 3 Edit 4 : Wow this blew up ... Thanks for all the questions ! I 'm getting to them all , do n't worry !",
      "Your brain begins to ( more or less)ignore all sensory input , and sleep paralysis sets in , so that you do n't \" act out \" your dreams and hurt yourself . Also , your brain waves change a lot .",
      "I love that moment when you realise you 're just about to fall asleep . Kind of like before anesthetic . I 've only been conscious of it a handful of times , and I get a little excited when it happens , but then try calm down in case I wake up too much ."

      "When you fall asleep, your body goes through a series of changes. Here's what happens: \n1. Your muscles start to relax: As you start to fall asleep, your muscles begin to relax, especially in your face, neck, and limbs. You might notice that your arms and legs feel heavy and you might feel a tingling sensation in your hands and feet. \n2. Your breathing and heart rate slow down: As you fall deeper into sleep, your breathing and heart rate slow down. You might notice that your breaths become slower and deeper, and your heart rate becomes more regular. \n3. Your brain waves change: There are different types of brain waves, and the type of brain wave you have depends on what you're doing. When you're awake, your brain waves are fast and active. But as you fall asleep, your brain waves slow down and become more regular. \n4. Your body temperature drops: As you fall asleep, your body temperature drops slightly. This is why you might feel cold when you first go to bed, but then warm up as you fall asleep. \n5. Your body enters different stages of sleep: There are two main types of sleep: REM (rapid eye movement) sleep and non-REM sleep. Non-REM sleep is divided into three stages: light sleep, deep sleep, and very deep sleep. As you fall asleep, you move through these stages of sleep in a cycle that lasts about 90 minutes. \nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

However, the theorem itself is not a legitimate mathematical concept and is purely fictional. It is not based on any real-world principles or theories of physics or mathematics. \nThe idea of \"mind switching\" is a common theme in science fiction and has been explored in various forms in literature and media, but it is not something that has been scientifically demonstrated to be possible.

      "There are a few reasons why people around the world might not use the local language to refer to other countries. Here are a few: \n1. History: Some countries have long histories of colonizing or being colonized by other countries. This can lead to the names of those countries being adopted in other languages. For example, \"Deutschland\" (Germany's name in German) might be called \"Germany\" in English because English speakers have a long history of interacting with Germany and its people. \n2. Language: English is spoken by a large number of people around the world and is often used as a common language for communication between people who speak different languages. This means that many people might use the English names for countries when they are communicating with someone who speaks a different language. \n3. Convenience: It can be easier to use a country's name in a common language like English because it is a name that is familiar to many people. Using a country's local name might be confusing to some people who are not familiar with the language. \nOverall, there are a variety of reasons why people might not use the local language to refer to countries. It's important to remember that different cultures and languages have their own ways of referring to things, and it's always a good idea to be respectful of these differences.",

    "human_answer": [
      "Because Wilson v. Arkansas did n't make a blanket announcement that police must knock and announce every time . There are still practical exceptions which is why SCOTUS said that it would be a case - by - case review . Exceptions include reasonable threat of danger and reasonable belief evidence would be destroyed . It makes no sense to require knock and announce in a hostage situation , not having the element of surprise could get the hostage and others killed . Typically they do n't want to knock and announce for drug busts because it can lead to evidence being destroyed .",
      "The most simple answer to this question is \" the Supreme Court of the United States said so . \" The more complicated answer is that while a knock and announce is part of the common law , this requirement can be done away with when there 's good reason to . Those reasons generally fall under the category of safety , preventing the destruction of evidence , and preventing escape . Though this goes back to \" the supreme court said so . \" It can , of course , be done away with by statute , but the answer to that is that the various legislatures have not seen fit to pass a law to make it illegal .",
      "So it dosnt brake the 4th amendment cause there is a warrant issued by a judge the main difference is the person or place in question is deemed dangerous or that the item they are looking for might be destroyed if they knocked .

    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "No-knock warrants are warrants that allow law enforcement officers to enter a property without first announcing their presence or purpose. In the United States, the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution protects citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government. This means that law enforcement officers generally need a warrant to search a person's home or property, and they must follow certain procedures when doing so. \nOne of these procedures is the \"knock and announce\" rule, which requires officers to announce their presence and purpose before entering a property. However, in some cases, officers may be able to get a no-knock warrant, which allows them to enter a property without first announcing their presence. \nNo-knock warrants are generally only granted in cases where there is a risk of danger to the officers or the public, or a risk that evidence might be destroyed if the officers announce their presence. In order to get a no-knock warrant, law enforcement officers must provide a judge with evidence that there is a good reason to bypass the knock and announce rule. \nThe Supreme Court has ruled that no-knock warrants are constitutional as long as they are used in a reasonable manner. This means that officers must have a good reason for using a no-knock warrant, and they must follow all other rules and procedures when executing the warrant. However, there have been cases where no-knock warrants have been used improperly, leading to controversy and calls for reform.",

The gas is ignited by a spark from the stove's ignition system, which is usually a small electrical device that generates a spark when you turn the burner knob to \"light.\" \nThe flame is contained within the burner and does not travel down the gas line because the gas is mixed with just the right amount of oxygen to produce a flame that is stable and does not spread. The burner also has a design that helps contain the flame, such as a small metal ring around the edge of the burner that helps direct the flame upwards. \nSo, in short, the flame on a gas stove is kept from traveling down the gas line because the gas is mixed with the right amount of oxygen, and the burner is designed to contain the flame.",

    "question": "Why is the letter \" W \" pronounced \" double - u \" when \" double - v \" would seem to be more accurate ? Also , \" W \" is the only letter in the alphabet with more than one syllable . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "This goes back to the time when U and V were actually the same letter ; so , in fact , were I and J. This is what the classical Latin alphabet looked like : A B C D E F G H I K L M N O P Q R S T V X Y Z But in handwriting , it looked a bit more like this : * a b c d e f g h j k l m n o p q r s t u x y z * Notice that in the capital letters , there is no J or U ; and in the cursive letters , no * i * or * v * . Instead , you had the following capital / cursive pairs : I*j * and V*u * . So the name \" Julius \" would , in Latin , be carved in stone as \" IVLIVS \" , but written by hand as \" * juljus * \" . These letters could be used as vowels or consonants ; so the letter \" I \" as a vowel had a sound like the \" i \" in \" sit \" , and as a consonant a sound like the \" y \" in \" yes \" ; the letter \" V \" had as a vowel a sound like the \" u \" in \" put \" , and as a consonant ... well , it was either like our \" w \" , or like our \" v \" . The smart money is on \" w \" , but there were no tape recorders in those days so we ca n't be sure . But a word like \" * uacuum * \" might have been pronounced \" wack - woom \" , and explains why our word \" vacuum \" has two Us in it . The phrase \" * uenj ujdj ujcj * \" , which we usually spell \" veni vidi vici \" ( \" I came , I saw , I conquered \" ) might have been pronounced \" wenny weedy weeky \" or \" wenny weedy wee - chee \" ( again , we ca n't be sure ) . When the Roman alphabet was used to write other languages , those other languages often had sounds that did n't exist in Latin . Sometimes they added extra letters ( for example , the letters \u00c3\u0090 and \u00c3\u009e , which are still used in modern Icelandic ) , sometimes they put two or more letters together to make a new sound ( for example , our TH ) . For some languages , a new letter was created by doubling the letter V -- so VV ; or , in cursive , * uu * . Hence the name , \" double - U \" . But additionally , the letters I and V were \" split \" , to make two versions of each -- originally , one for the vowel and one for the consonant . So the letter I*j * was split to make Ii for the vowel and Jj for the consonant ( which in modern English is now pronounced differently -- in modern German it 's still pronounced like our Y ) ; V*u * was similarly split to make Uu ( vowel ) and Vv ( consonant ) . The W took on the form of the V , but we kept the name \" double - U \" . This is actually appropriate , because the English \" w \" sound is , in effect , a very short \" u \" sound . Languages like French did n't originally have this letter , because it was n't needed -- except for writing foreign words , like \" le weekend \" . But since the W now looks like two Vs , the French called it \" double - V \" . Incidentally , although you might not think it , the sounds of \" W \" and \" V \" are , phonetically , very closely related . Native English speakers can hear the difference so clearly they do n't realise how similar they are ; many Germans , however , find it very difficult , and often confuse the sounds , saying \" wiolin \" instead of \" violin \" , for example . Both sounds are also very closely related to \" U \" .",
      "Actually in several Other languages such as French and Spanish it is pronounced double - V ( or the French equivalent ) In reality the double - U pronunciation probable come from a handwriting variation where the W was actually written with a more curved bottom giving it a double - U look . Edit : An Image of a double - u W- URL_0",
      "In ancient Rome the sounds of U , V , and W , as we currently know them , were not distinguished without context . Context was typically required to get pronunciation \" right \" . The roman V was pronounced both as a \u00e2\u0080\u0098 w \u00e2\u0080\u0099 in words like VENI ( pronounced \u00e2\u0080\u009c way - nee \u00e2\u0080\u009d ) and as the vowel \u00e2\u0080\u0098 u \u00e2\u0080\u0099 in words like IVLIUS ( pronounced as \u00e2\u0080\u009c Julius \u00e2\u0080\u009d ) . As a result , many languages _ do _ use UU shape , and many actually pronounce it \" double v \" . All because the romans could n't create any clarity ;)"

      "Great question! The letter \"W\" is pronounced \"double-u\" because that's how it has been traditionally pronounced in English. In fact, the letter \"W\" is not the only letter in the alphabet with more than one syllable - the letter \"A\" is also pronounced with two syllables when it is used as a long vowel sound, as in the word \"paint.\" \nThe letter \"W\" was originally derived from the runic symbol \"wynn,\" which was used to represent the sound \"w\" in Old English. Over time, the letter \"W\" came to be pronounced as \"double-u,\" even though it might seem more logical to pronounce it as \"double-v.\" \nOne reason for this is that the letter \"V\" and the letter \"W\" have very different histories and origins. The letter \"V\" comes from the Latin letter \"V,\" which was used to represent the sound \"v.\" On the other hand, the letter \"W\" comes from the runic symbol \"wynn,\" which was used to represent the sound \"w\" in Old English. As a result, the letters \"V\" and \"W\" have always had different sounds and pronunciations, even though they look similar. \nI hope this helps to clear things up!",

      "If you think about the news casters today they all have the same cadence in how they speak . No one speaks like that in real life .

But we can no longer take seriously the old news casters . Also accents change over time inside and outside the news room",
      "First of all , languages are constantly evolving . Your grandchildren will probably grow up thinking that the way you speak is old - fashioned and quaint . There are also changes in cultural attitudes . 100 years ago , it was the educated and those with higher social status who were considered to have authority . As a sign of their status , these people would speak in a dialect as close as possible to an agreed standard , and would also use a more respectful , formal tone . Strong regional accents were usually seen as uneducated . Today , we find that snobbish and elitist , and prefer a more relaxed , informal approach . We dismiss formal registers as \" posh \" , and are more egalitarian than our grandparents were . Finally , of course , sound quality was less than it is now , and radio and TV signals broadcast over the airwaves was subject to interference , sometimes making it difficult to hear . So people enunciated their words more clearly , pronouncing every consonant distinctly and exaggerating the vowels . The \" BBC English \" used in the early days of British radio and TV is a very clear example of this , the vowels so exaggerated that it sounds quite alien to us now . It just made it easier to hear what was being said over all the hisses , crackles and whistles ."

      "There are a few reasons why people in some parts of the world, such as the Netherlands and other Western European countries, are taller on average than people in other parts of the world. One reason is genetics. People inherit traits such as height from their parents, and certain genetic traits that contribute to taller height may be more common in some populations than in others. \nAnother reason is nutrition. People who have access to a varied and nutritious diet are more likely to grow to be tall and healthy. This is especially true during childhood and adolescence, when the body is still growing. In the past, people in the Netherlands and other Western European countries may have had better access to nutritious food, which could have contributed to their taller average height. \nThere are also other factors that can affect height, such as health care and living conditions. People who live in countries with good health care and safe, clean living conditions are more likely to grow to be tall and healthy.

      "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a particle accelerator, not a heat source. It is designed to collide particles together at very high energies, but these collisions do not produce heat in the way that burning a piece of wood does. Instead, the energy of the collisions is converted into other forms of energy, such as the kinetic energy of the particles that are produced in the collision or the energy of new particles that are created. \nTo understand how the LHC works, it helps to think about a simpler example: two cars colliding head-on at high speed. When the cars collide, they transfer their kinetic energy (the energy they have due to their motion) to each other. This energy can be converted into other forms of energy, such as the sound of the collision or the heat that is produced as the cars deform and the materials they are made of stretch and break. \nSimilarly, when particles collide in the LHC, they transfer their energy to each other, and this energy can be converted into various forms. The LHC is designed to produce very high-energy collisions, but the energy of the collisions is spread out over a very small volume, so it does not produce a significant amount of heat. \nI hope this helps to clarify how the LHC works and why it does not produce enough heat to burn a hole through the planet!

      "Our eyes are able to move independently to some extent, but they also have the ability to move together in the same direction. This is because our eyes are controlled by muscles and nerves that work together to allow us to move them. \nWhen we want to look at something, our brains send a signal to the muscles in our eyes telling them which way to move. These muscles are called extraocular muscles, and they are responsible for moving our eyes in different directions. \nThere are several benefits to being able to move our eyes together. For one, it allows us to have better depth perception, which is the ability to judge the distance of objects from us. When we look at an object, our brain uses the difference in the images that our two eyes see to determine how far away the object is. \nAdditionally, being able to move our eyes together helps us to track moving objects more easily. For example, if we are watching a bird fly through the sky, our eyes will move together to follow the bird as it moves. This helps us to keep the bird in focus and see it more clearly. \nSo in short, our eyes are able to move independently to some extent, but they also have the ability to move together in the same direction.

      "Sure! Let's pretend that you have a cookie jar that represents your virtual currency, and each cookie in the jar represents one unit of your virtual currency. When you bought $200 worth of virtual currency, you were essentially buying a certain number of cookies from someone else. \nNow, imagine that the value of each cookie can change over time, just like the value of a real-world currency like the US dollar can change. If the value of each cookie goes up, then the total value of all the cookies in your jar will also go up. \nFor example, let's say that when you bought your cookies, each one was worth $1. But over the next four years, the value of each cookie goes up to $10. If you have 200 cookies in your jar, then the total value of your cookies would be 200 cookies * $10 per cookie = $2,000. \nNow, let's say that the value of each cookie goes up even more, to $12. If you have 200 cookies in your jar, then the total value of your cookies would be 200 cookies * $12 per cookie = $2,400. \nSo, if the value of each unit of your virtual currency goes up over time, then the total value of your virtual currency can also go up. That's how $200 worth of virtual currency can turn into $2.4 million in four years.",

FM stands for \"frequency modulation,\" which refers to the way that the radio station sends its signal over the airwaves. FM radio uses higher frequency waves to transmit the signal, and these waves are able to carry more information and provide better sound quality. AM radio, on the other hand, stands for \"amplitude modulation\" and uses lower frequency waves that are not able to transmit as much information or provide as good of sound quality.

    "human_answer": [
      "The chain rule . When you write sin^2 x ( a convenient notation ) as ( sin x)^2 the derivative is 2(sin x ) times the derivative of what is inside , which is cos x. So the derivative is 2(sin x)(cos x ) . We can actually use the chain rule in the derivative of x^2 but it 's sort of hidden . Write x^2 as ( x)^2 which has derivative 2x times the derivative of what is inside , which is 1 , but anything times 1 is itself so the derivative is just 2x . In general , the derivative of any differentiable function of the form f(g(x ) ) is f'(g(x))g'(x ) where f ' and g ' are the respective derivatives of f and g , and this is the chain rule . In your example , f(x)=x^2 and g(x)=sin x. Antiderivatives are more complicated because while it is easy to apply the chain rule in one direction ( derivatives ) , it is not so easy to go backwards ( antiderivatives ) . Sometimes u substitution works but not always .",
      "You mean \" differentiated , \" not \" derived . \" For any function f(x ) , let 's differentiate ( f(x))^2 . By chain rule you get d / dx ( ( f(x))^2 ) = 2 f(x ) f'(x ) When f(x ) = x , you get f'(x ) = 1 so the derivative is just 2x . When f(x ) = sin(x ) , you get derivative of ( f(x))^2 = sin^2(x ) is 2 sin(x ) cos(x ) . So the answer is that when you differentiate the square of something there 's an extra term in the product due to chain rule , it 's just that when you 're trying to differentiate x^2 the extra term is 1 and ends up not mattering . FWIW I think sin^2(x ) is a bad and confusing notation , I much prefer ( sin(x))^2 , but changing standards that have been in use for decades or centuries is really hard .",

      "Derivatives and integrals are operations that allow us to find the rate of change of a function or the area under a curve, respectively. The derivative of a function tells us how the function is changing at any given point, and the integral of a function gives us the total amount that the function has changed over a certain interval. \nThe derivative of x^2 is 2x because x^2 is increasing at a rate of 2x at every point. In other words, if x is increasing by a small amount, then x^2 is increasing by twice that amount. This relationship is captured by the derivative of x^2, which is 2x. \nThe derivative of sin^2 x, on the other hand, is not equal to 2 sin x. The derivative of sin^2 x is actually 2 sin x cos x. This is because sin^2 x is not increasing at a constant rate like x^2. Instead, the rate at which sin^2 x is increasing depends on the value of sin x and cos x at that point. When sin x is large and cos x is small, sin^2 x is increasing quickly. When sin x is small and cos x is large, sin^2 x is increasing more slowly. The derivative of sin^2 x takes this changing rate of change into account. \nSimilarly, the integral of x is x^2/2 because the total amount that x has changed over a certain interval can be represented by the area of a rectangle with base x and height x/2. The integral of sin x or cos x, on the other hand, cannot be represented by a simple polynomial like x^2/2.

    "human_answer": [
      "This rib cage is able to \" expand \" because each rib is attached at a movable joint to both the vertebrae and to the sternum via cartilage . The ribs do n't actually expand , they move up and down ( the angle up / down that they move is determined by the angle of the rib at the attachment to the vertebra ) . Upper ribs move more vertically ( think of the sternum as a well pump handle [ URL_0 ] , but with ribs coming off of it . That is the plane of movement of these ribs . So these ribs will be moving mostly up / down).The lower ribs have a more out and up sweeping type motion ( that is why when you inhale deeply the sides of your chest expand , because of this sweeping motion . ) There are a lot of muscles that interact with the ribs to facilitate this movement , most notably the diaphragm , but other muscles ( intercostals , serratus posterior , levator costorum , scaleneus ) act on the ribs to pull them up and down . Hope this helps",
      "The areas between each rib are known as intercostal spaces and within these spaces are both interior and external intercostal muscles . Others have explained how they are connected to the vertebrae in the back and through hyaline cartilage at the sternum . Our ribs have a natural downward slope to them . The reason for this is so that when our external intercostal muscles contract with inspiration ( breathing in ) , the muscles physically raise the ribs to increase the size of the thoracic cavity by essentially just repositioning the ribs . This is possible because the connective tissue on the sternal end of the rib is hyaline cartilage which possesses elastic tendencies . The rib is not physically expanding , it is just being repositioned with help from the intercostal muscles , connective cartilage , and diaphragm . This is a fairly good gif to explain the repositioning of the rib cage to \" expand \" it that occurs with inspiration . ( URL_0 )",
      "Your ribs are attached to your sternum ( \" breastbone \" , in the middle of your chest ) and to your backbone . The attachment to the backbone is a \" gliding \" joint -- it can move a small amount . The attachment at the front is not actually a joint at all .

      "The ribs are bones that are attached to the spine and help protect the organs in the chest, such as the heart and lungs. While the ribs are generally not able to move or expand on their own, they do move slightly when we breathe. \nWhen we inhale, or take a deep breath in, the muscles between the ribs, called the intercostal muscles, contract and pull the ribs upwards and outwards. This expands the chest cavity and creates more space for the lungs to fill with air. When we exhale, or breathe out, the intercostal muscles relax and the ribs return to their normal position. \nSo, while the ribs themselves do not expand, the chest cavity can expand and contract when we breathe, which can make it seem like the ribs are expanding.

      "Erosion is a very slow process . The sphinx got somewhat eroded , but it would take hundreds of thousands years for the wind to erode solid stone blocks ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "The pyramids of Egypt have survived for thousands of years because they were built to last. They are made of large blocks of stone, which are much less prone to weathering and erosion than softer materials like sand or dirt. The stones were also cut and fitted together very carefully, which has helped them to stay in place over time. \nThe pyramids are also located in a desert region, where there is not a lot of rain or other types of weather that can cause erosion. The dry climate has also helped to preserve the pyramids, as there is no moisture in the air to wear away the stones. \nIn addition, the pyramids are located in a relatively isolated area, which means they are not exposed to a lot of foot traffic or other types of wear and tear that can damage them. All of these factors have contributed to the pyramids' longevity, and that's why they are still standing after all these years.",

    "question": "What is Unitarian Universalism ? I 've recently been trying to find myself in the world , and I came across Unitarian Universalism . I 've found a lot of mixed information . So , what is it ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "It helps if you break it down . Unitarians are Christians who deny the Trinity , they say that God is One Person , that Jesus is either the son of , but not God , or that he and the Father are the same . They often also reject original sin , predestination , and biblical inerrancy . Universalism is a movement that emphasizes that religion is a fundamental aspect of human beings . In a Christian context , it 's the doctrine that all souls , no matter how sinful , will be reconciled to God by his love and mercy . Unitarian Universalism is the meeting of these two doctrines . They hold that religion is a universal part of being human , they talk a lot about the things that religions have in common , and they are accepting of people from any and every religious background , because in the end , we 're all going to be with God , no matter what book we read from now .",
      "I have been to UU churches . The local one here focuses on inclusion , pursuing knowledge and serving the community . I would say the majority of the congregation is ex - Catholic . According to people I know there , \" Our dogma is there is no dogma . \" What I have found inviting is the openness to new ideas and other ways of thinking and living . I have found more intelligent , thoughtful conversation there than almost anywhere else in my town . They have pagans , Buddhists , agnostics and atheists in their church . Probably others too , I would guess .",
      "Well it 's no surprise because we tend to be pretty mixed . Our origin comes from Christianity , but a lot of our traditions and practices are based on whatever new members bring to our community . Within Christianity there 's been a * very * old debate about what it takes to get into heaven / be right with God / be saved from sin : do you have to perform correct deeds , or is it enough to believe correct things?^1 From time to time some Christians would think that believing is a form of doing , and that a loving God would not damn any person eternally . Those views were suppressed until the protestant reformation made it possible for some scholars to teach them openly in some countries . And as they believed there was no reason to convert the infidels to save their souls , many also found inspiration in the commonalities between some of their traditions and those of other religions . From there it snowballed into a modern religion with no official doctrines , that is about a community dedicated to \u00e2\u0080\u009c a free and responsible search for truth and meaning \u00e2\u0080\u009d . As for myself I was raised Christian , became atheist / agnostic / it 's complicated , then adopted the teachings of Epicurus as a systematic philosophy of life , then since he emphasized having a community I found UU to be the one compatible with my beliefs / views / whatever . In our day - to - day activities we coordinate most frequently with our local Reform Jewish synagogue and United Church of Christ church ."

    "question": "Why race car tires have more traction without treads but consumer tires have more traction with treads . Uh , see title . Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Not including the compound of the rubber ( race ties being softer , and usually of a different chemical makeup ) , the difference comes down to water and heat cycles . Race tires without treads make the most contact , but they are used only in the dry . Consumer tires have to handle multiple conditions , including water . The treads channel water away from the tires surface , allowing the tire to make contact with the road instead of floating on top of the water . Consumer tires have far less traction when \" bald \" usually due to heat cycling , and the fact the the compound at that level is often different than the compound at the surface when a tire is newer . Heat cycling is essentially the hardening of the rubber each time the tire warms up and cools down . The harder the tire , the less grip . Many racers that are restricted to \" street \" tires will often shave tread off of brand new tires to reduce the amount of tread \" squirm \" and often get to a different compound ( if the tire is molded in such a way ) .",
      "Treads are really only better for driving in the rain . If it 's not raining , you tires have more traction on asphalt / concrete if they 're smooth . But smooth tires are terrible in the rain , so having treads is necessary for our cars .",
      "The treads on consumer tires are a trade off . In dry conditions they provide less traction than a racing slick would . In wet conditions , the treads displace water allowing the tire to grip the road , whereas racing tires would just slide ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "Race car tires are designed to provide maximum grip and traction on a racetrack. They are made of a special rubber compound that is very sticky and helps the tires adhere to the track surface. In addition, race car tires are generally very smooth and have no treads. This is because treads can actually reduce grip on a smooth surface like a racetrack. \nOn the other hand, consumer tires are designed to be used on the road and are therefore built to handle a variety of surfaces and conditions. Treads on consumer tires help to provide grip on wet or slippery roads by channeling water away from the tire and increasing the tire's contact with the road. Treads also help to provide traction on loose or uneven surfaces, such as gravel or dirt roads. \nIn summary, race car tires have more traction without treads because they are designed specifically for use on smooth, dry racetracks. Consumer tires have more traction with treads because they need to be able to handle a variety of road conditions, including wet and slippery surfaces.",

    "human_answer": [
      "It makes the store feel open and less crowded , and it lets you set up displays that take advantage of the height , such as signs visible anywhere in the store . It also makes moving things with machinery like forklifts easier . Psychological experiments have shown that people do n't like being in areas with low ceilings . Some airports have made use of low ceilings in places where they do n't want people to linger , like the front of the check in line . edit : check in , not check out .",
      "The greatest benefit to height is in the event of a fire . Higher ceilings allow more time for smoke and heat to accumulate before affecting things closer to the floor ( e.g. , people , fire load / combustibles ) . The height also can allow for fire suppression systems that cover a greater area with fewer components , such as sprinkler heads . In addition , it is generally easier to control the climate in a larger space with larger air volumes ( exchanges per hour ) that are not as noticeable in one spot . ( Except for those annoying freeze - or - fry areas where air flows are concentrated . ) The air handlers in these systems can also be configured for use following a fire to assist in evacuating smoke from a building , either by exhaust or pressurizing the building ( negative and positive pressure ventilation , respectively ) . Construction costs would tend to be slightly higher because of the longer ( higher ) columns required , which in turn need to be stronger because of ( typically ) larger roof systems such as bar joists or trusses . Such costs can be somewhat offset by reducing the number of columns required . When designers are tasked to create ' open space ' , regardless of low or high ceilings , larger columns with stronger roof systems allow column spacing to be increased , thus ' opening ' the space . However , this is not always the case , such as in multi - story structures where significant weight / loads on higher floors require different column sizes or spacing ( e.g. , airports , parking ramps , hotels ) . Operating costs do tend to be higher , but it is a trade off on the desired space / affect and what is considered reasonable operating expense . Such factors are taken into consideration during the design phase of projects , so the owner / operator knows early - on what to expect . These factors also contribute to changes in a design if costs are deemed to be unreasonable or exceeding targets / goals . Source : Engineer by day , Firefighter by night .

      "Grocery stores often have high ceilings for a few reasons. One reason is that high ceilings can make a space feel bigger and more open, which can be more appealing to customers. This is especially important in stores that are crowded or have a lot of merchandise, as it can help to create a sense of space and make the store feel less cluttered. \nAnother reason is that high ceilings can help to improve the lighting in a store. Higher ceilings allow for the use of more and bigger windows, which can bring in more natural light. This can create a brighter, more welcoming atmosphere and make it easier for customers to see and navigate the store. \nAdditionally, high ceilings can also help with air circulation and temperature control. Air can circulate more freely in a space with high ceilings, which can help to keep the store cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. This can make the store more comfortable for customers and employees, which can be important for customer satisfaction. \nOverall, while high ceilings may increase initial building costs and heating costs, they can also have many benefits that make them worth it for grocery stores.",

In fact, attempting to punch through hard surfaces can cause serious injury to the hand and wrist, as well as damage the object being punched. \nHowever, some people may demonstrate the ability to break certain objects, such as wood or brick, using techniques that involve striking the object with a focused, precise force. This is typically done using a combination of physical strength, speed, and technique, as well as proper conditioning of the hand and wrist to withstand the impact. \nThe scientific explanation for this phenomenon is that the force of the punch is concentrated on a small area, allowing the punch to break the object. In addition, the object being punched may have imperfections or weaknesses that allow it to break more easily when struck. \nIt's important to note that breaking objects is not a common or necessary skill in martial arts, and attempting to do so can be dangerous.

There are basically three options to have shelter : * ( a ) Free shelter ( from someone else who is paying for it ) * ( b ) Rented shelter ( temporarily having possession of property that is owned by someone else ) * ( c ) Owned shelter ( the property is yours ) Let 's say Bob wants shelter . Charlie owns a home . If Bob wants to live in Charlie 's home , he may offer to pay rent every week / month in order to have permission to live inside of Charlie 's property . The relationship between Bob and Charlie is called a \" landlord - tenant relationship , \" and has its own laws and rules that each must follow . In the end , though , Bob is responsible for compensating Charlie for a % of the value Charlie has lost in his home ( because now he must share a part of it with Bob ) . This payment is a fraction of the value of Charlie 's home because Bob only enjoys a fraction of its benefit . One day , Bob decide 's he loves the home but dislikes living with Charlie . It so - happens that Charlie is looking to move to a different state . Charlie offers to sell his home to Bob for the \" fair market value \" ( what the average buyer would pay ) of his home : $ 200,000 . Like most people , Bob does n't have $ 200,000 , so he goes to find someone who does ( a \" lender \" ) . The Lender , usually a bank , has a lot of money and it makes money based on loaning it out to people . There is a cost to a loan . If a Lender gives you a $ 100 loan , due in a week , at 10 % interest , then in 1 week you will need to pay the Lender back $ 110 . In exchange for you having access to $ 100 immediately , the \" cost \" of the service was $ 10 . Here , the Lender will look at the potential deal between Bob and Charlie . They will see that Charlie has a house worth $ 200,000 , and Bob is willing to promise to buy it and pay for it over time . Using various calculations , risk assessments , and other economic factors , the Lender decides that Bob is worthy of a loan . It is common for Bob to have to pay at least a portion of the $ 200,000 ( 1 to 3 % ) , but the rest of that $ 200,000 will be paid from the Lender to Charlie on behalf of Bob . Once everything \" closes \" ( finalizes / goes through / is paid ) , Bob now owns Charlie 's house , * * subject * * to a mortgage owned by the Lender . In this case , Bob is paying $ X per month for 30 years with an interest rate of Y% . After 30 years , Bob will have paid well over $ 200,000 for the home ... how much over depends on the interest rate and his initial cash payment . Bob loves his house . He is making his mortgage payments , and life is good . In fact , 3 years later , there is a boom in the housing market and Bob 's house is now worth $ 400,000 . This means that if Bob were to sell his house today , he would be paid $ 400,000 and , from that , he would pay off the remainder of his loan to the Lender and make a profit of , say , $ 200,000 ( for the sake of keeping things simple ) . But what if Bob does n't want to sell the home ? That unrealized profit of $ 200,000 is called \" equity . \" Bob may want to \" cash - out \" on that $ 200,000 in equity in order to invest it in other stuff , which would require the Lender to agree to \" refinance \" ( modify ) the original agreement . Now , Bob owes $ 400,000 on his $ 400,000 home , but has received $ 200,000 cash . The most common reason to refinance , though , is a change in interest rates . Remember that when the Lender originally reviewed Bob for a loan , it made its offer based on many factors . Over time , those factors can change considerably . If , for example , the Lender had given Bob an interest rate of 10 % , but now interest rates are at 5 % , then it would save Bob a lot of money to negotiate with the Lender in order to reduce the interest rate to 5 % . Does the Lender need to ? No . Bob and Lender have an agreement already . However , if the Lender can figure out a way to increase its profit on the agreement ( for example , if the house is now worth more money ) , then it will be worth it to agree to receive less money in mortgage in exchange for a more valuable security . In other words ... remember how Lenders make money by lending money ? They do n't want Charlie 's house . So if Bob decided to immediately stop making payments on his mortgage after buying it , then the Lender would have been stuck with a $ 200,000 house that it paid about $ 200,000 for . But after 3 years when the house is worth $ 400,000 , if Bob stops making payments then the Lender has the ability to quickly recoup the money it is owed from the sale of the home , even if it has to sell it slightly below market value . So Refinancing provides a way for Bob to use the increased value of his property to reduce the cost of his loan to Lender because the increased value of the property also reduces the risk to Lender that it will be able to get the money it is owed . For the Lender , best case scenario = Bob pays the exact amount of money agreed upon within the time frame agreed upon . Worst case scenario = Bob fails to pay , but Lender will be able to sell the home to someone else that will pay that bill . * * tl;dr :* * Refinancing takes into account all the various factors that have changed since the time an agreement was originally made and adjusts the agreement in a way that is mutually beneficial to the borrower and the Lender ."

      "When you refinance a house, you are essentially taking out a new loan to pay off your existing mortgage. This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as to get a lower interest rate, to change the length of the loan, or to access the equity you have built up in your home. \nHere's an example of how refinancing might work: \nLet's say that you have a mortgage on your home with an interest rate of 5%. You've been paying on this mortgage for a few years and have built up some equity in your home. Now, you find out that you can refinance your mortgage and get a new loan with an interest rate of 4%. This would mean that you would be paying less in interest each month, which would lower your monthly mortgage payments. \nTo do this, you would need to apply for a new mortgage and go through the process of getting approved for the loan. Once you have been approved, the lender will pay off your old mortgage and give you a new loan with the lower interest rate. You will then make payments on this new loan instead of the old one. \nOverall, refinancing a house can be a good way to save money on your mortgage payments or to access the equity you have built up in your home. However, it's important to consider all of the costs associated with refinancing, such as closing costs, to make sure that it makes financial sense for you.",

      "That's a very big and complex question that has puzzled philosophers, scientists, and thinkers for centuries. It's difficult to give a simple answer, but here is one way to think about it: \nEverything that exists has a cause or explanation for why it is the way it is. For example, if you have a pencil on your desk, you might wonder why it's there. The answer could be that someone put it there, or that you needed it for a task and got it out of a drawer. Either way, there is a reason or cause for why the pencil is on your desk. \nBut when we try to think about the whole universe and everything in it, it becomes more difficult to find a cause or explanation. If we ask why the universe exists, we might try to find something or someone that caused it to exist. But then we have to ask what caused that thing or person, and so on. This can lead to an infinite loop, where we keep asking \"why?\" but never find a final answer. \nOne possible way to think about the existence of the universe is that it simply exists, and there isn't necessarily a cause or explanation for why. This idea is sometimes called the \"principle of sufficient reason,\" and it suggests that the universe doesn't need a cause because it is a fundamental aspect of reality. \nIt's important to note that these are just some ways to think about the question of existence, and there is no one \"right\" answer.

Milk teeth also have thinner enamel, the hard outer layer that protects teeth, which makes them more prone to cavities. \nOne of the reasons that children lose their milk teeth is because they are simply not strong enough to last a lifetime. They were only meant to be temporary, and once the permanent teeth start to come in, the milk teeth are no longer needed.

    "human_answer": [
      "The victory for dominance comes when the an animal has established dominance over the other . Whenever the other animal feels powerless to continue , the dominating animal will psychologically feel being \" in charge \" . The other animal might feel \" under control \" , and thus he / she is n't dominative . How an animal \" knows \" who won the fight is how their minds make them feel . Dying is not necessary for this to happen , mere circumstances can be enough to induce these feelings . In battles of power , the classic psychological reactions are \" fight \" , \" flight \" and \" freeze \" . Flight and freeze automatically assert submission over the situation , as the animal feels that he / she is unable to fight and thus is n't dominative . Fight on the other hand implies dominance , and if both of the animals fight , whoever switches either to \" flight \" or \" freeze \" first loses dominance . Much of this happens also in the human world . For example , if you have a debate with someone , and you win by your arguments , then you may feel dominative . And conversely , if you lose , you may feel submissive .",

Similarly, if one animal is able to drive the other animal away or make them retreat, it may be clear that they have won the fight. \nIt's also important to note that animals don't always have to fight to determine dominance. In some cases, they may use other forms of communication, such as vocalizations or gestures, to establish their dominance without physically engaging in a fight. \nIn general, animals have developed a variety of ways to communicate with each other and establish social hierarchies, and they are often able to understand these signals and determine who has won a fight or other competition without resorting to lethal violence.",

      "Smooth bores allow the firing of complex projectiles that might pop out fins for example , or have aerodynamics which should n't be disturbed . Rifling actually cuts into the projectile and would cause harm to such a tank round . Instead modern rounds use sabots which allow a wide variety of projectile shapes .",
      "The M1 actually originally used a rifled barrel before the A1 upgrade replaced it with a smoothbore system . The British and Indian Main Battle Tanks still retain rifled barrels . Smoothbore barrels do n't wear as fast as rifled barrels , so maintenance is a consideration but it depends largely on the ammunition you want to use . Your choice of munitions will be informed by who you expect to be fighting and what sort of fighting it will be - big open terrain tank battles ( as envisaged taking place in W.Germany during the Cold War ) , or in - town anti - insurgency , anti - personnel fighting where the enemy have no tanks or heavy armour . If you want to use fin - stabilised rounds for accurate long range shooting and some of the newer anti - personnel rounds ( which are basically glorified shotgun cartridges that fire multiple projectiles simultaneously ) then a smoothbore barrel is good . If you want to use traditional spin - stabilised high explosive shells then a rifled barrel is required . The invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan was one of the reasons for the Americans to move to a smooth - bore barrel - the fighting there involved very little anti - tank activity and was mostly anti - personnel and anti - building , which called for munitions better served through a smooth - bore barrel .",
      "So here 's the thing about most technology breakthroughs ; they 're not really inventing new ideas , they 're just using old ideas in a new way . Smooth bores were terrible when we had \" dumb \" projectiles , so we rifled the bores to correct for bad bullets .

As the see - saw of innovation continues , technologies come in and out of usefulness , but never truly go away ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "Rifled guns are still used in modern tanks, but smoothbore cannons have become more prevalent for a few reasons. \nOne reason is that smoothbore cannons can fire a wider variety of ammunition, including fin-stabilized projectiles and shaped charges, which can be effective against certain types of armor. Rifled guns, on the other hand, are typically limited to firing kinetic energy projectiles. \nAnother reason is that smoothbore cannons can fire projectiles at higher velocities, which can be useful for defeating modern armor. This is because the smooth bore allows the projectile to maintain a higher velocity as it travels down the barrel, whereas the rifling in a rifled gun can cause the projectile to slow down slightly. \nFinally, smoothbore cannons are generally simpler and cheaper to manufacture, which can be an important consideration when designing military equipment. \nOverall, the choice between using a rifled gun or a smoothbore cannon in a tank often comes down to the specific role that the tank is intended to play and the types of threats it is likely to encounter. Both types of guns have their own advantages and disadvantages, and both can be effective in the right circumstances.",

      "Others have answered why we have n't gone further down and I would summarize by saying that , ignoring everything else , it 's so hot it would melt anything we could use to dig . But there are ways to understand the interior of the Earth aside from digging . One is similar to sonar , which is how bats \" see \" by bouncing sounds off of it . Earthquakes provide the \" sound \" and we monitor how those waves bounces off the layers to understand the structure of the Earth . Then we use our understanding of the rules of physics and chemistry to see what the temperature and pressure is at those regions and it gives us an idea of what the structures are made of . We can compare this kind of thing to lava ( which is the material from the layer between the crust and the core ) to see if we 're on to something . To look at the core we use the same kind of approach but we do n't have core material . So we look at what might be there -- heavy stuff like iron and nickel that was around when the planet formed , the magnetic field that we think comes from the movement of the material in the core , and how the planet spins on its axis .

For example, you might have been born in a country that does not recognize your parents as citizens, or you might have been stripped of your citizenship by the country you were previously a citizen of. \nBeing stateless can be a very difficult situation, because it means that you do not have the rights and protections that citizenship usually provides. For example, you might not have the right to live and work in any particular country, or to access education, healthcare, and other services. \nIf you find yourself in a situation where you are stateless, it is important to seek help from organizations that can assist you in getting your citizenship recognized by a country or in finding a solution to your situation.",

    "question": "Why is it that the more expensive a restaurant is , the less food you get ? Generally speaking ... Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Generally , at cheaper restaurants , especially in America , serving sizes are way bigger than they need to be ( a human stomach is roughly the size of your fist ) . The serving sizes are increased to give the impression of value for money ; for the restaurant , the cost of the food is not much compared to labour , rent , maintenance , etc . At fancier restaurants , the experience is about the food more so than about value . Eating huge portion sizes tends to dull your appreciation of the food after the first few bites , so the portion sizes are smaller . The idea is to take your time and savour a few different foods , rather than gorging yourself .",
      "the quality of the food goes up not the quantity . You can buy shit grade quality food in bulk for very little , its why buffets exist , buy loads of a things , at a low price for a lot that is n't great quality . Or a little bit at a high price for the best quality and have that at expensive restaurants",
      "Because you are paying for the atmosphere . You are paying for the experienced waitstaff and chefs . That location probably has a good location too , so they have a higher rent to pay . They can also use higher quality ingredients ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "There are a few reasons why you might get less food at a more expensive restaurant: \n1. Higher quality ingredients: More expensive restaurants often use higher quality ingredients, which can be more expensive to source and prepare. As a result, the portion sizes may be smaller, but the food is generally considered to be of a higher quality. \n2. Presentation: More expensive restaurants often put more effort into the presentation of their dishes, which can include adding more garnishes or making the food look more visually appealing. This can take up more space on the plate, leaving less room for the actual food. \n3. Ambiance: More expensive restaurants often have a more upscale ambiance, which can include things like nicer decor, more attentive service, and a more relaxed atmosphere. These factors can contribute to the overall dining experience, which some people are willing to pay more for. \n4. Profit margins: Like any business, restaurants need to make a profit in order to stay open. Higher prices can help to cover the costs of running the restaurant, including things like rent, utilities, and employee salaries. By charging more for their food, restaurants are able to make a profit while still offering high-quality ingredients and a pleasant dining experience. \nOverall, the price of a meal at a restaurant is often a reflection of the quality of the ingredients, the effort that goes into the presentation of the dish, and the overall dining experience. While you might get less food at a more expensive restaurant, the food is often of a higher quality and the dining experience is generally considered to be more enjoyable.",

    "question": "can a submarine stop and hover at the same depth like a helicopter , or does it need to continue to be on the move in order not to sink like a plane , how \\ why ? edit : thank you guys;great answers :-) Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "In principle a submarine can stop and maintain depth , but they tend not to be very good at it . This is because , when stopped , they have to rely on trim tanks ( which can pump water in and out ) to adjust the buoyancy to keep the submarine at completely neutral buoyancy , as any small difference will cause the submarine to slowly drift up or down . This tends not to be a very accurate process , plus you are then susceptible to any upwards or downwards currents . So typically submarines will maintain a very slow speed ( 1 - 3 knots , if memory serves ) when they want to hold position , because that allows them to use their dive planes ( the little wings that are on the sides of the submarine ) . The dives planes can react quickly to changes in depth / buoyancy and can also help keep the submarine level . Source : I played some very detailed submarine simulation games recently , and this was mentioned in the ( very long ) manuals .",
      "They can stop and be still . It 's hard because of underwater currents but when the motors stop , they kinda float around like a bath toy . They only do this though when they need to run silent . Most of the time they can just keep heading their course .",
      "A submarine is more like a blimp than a plane . It pumps water in or out of ballast tanks to maintain neutral buoyancy . It is floating in the water , not flying through it ."
    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "Submarines can stop and hover at a certain depth in the water, just like a helicopter can hover in the air. However, unlike a helicopter, a submarine doesn't use any special equipment to stay in one place. Instead, it uses something called \"neutral buoyancy\" to hover in the water. \nBuoyancy is the force that makes objects float or sink. When an object is more buoyant, it will float, and when it is less buoyant, it will sink. A submarine can control its buoyancy by taking in or letting out water from special tanks called \"ballast tanks.\" \nWhen a submarine wants to go down, it takes in water into its ballast tanks, making it more dense and less buoyant. When it wants to go up, it lets the water out of its ballast tanks, making it less dense and more buoyant. By carefully controlling the amount of water in its ballast tanks, a submarine can hover at a certain depth in the water without sinking or rising. \nSo, to sum it up, a submarine can stop and hover in the water by using its ballast tanks to control its buoyancy.",

    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "The International Space Station (ISS) orbits the Earth in a path that is shaped like a slightly squashed circle, or an oval. This is because the ISS is being pulled towards the Earth by the Earth's gravity, but it is also moving very fast. When an object moves very fast, it is harder for gravity to pull it down, so it follows a curved path instead of falling straight down. \nTo stay in orbit, the ISS has to keep moving at a specific speed and altitude. If it slows down or drops too low, it will fall back to Earth. If it speeds up or climbs too high, it will fly off into space. To maintain its orbit, the ISS uses thrusters, which are small engines that produce a jet of gas to push against. By firing the thrusters, the ISS can adjust its speed and direction to stay in its desired orbit. \nIn the attached image, you can see a diagram of the ISS's orbit around the Earth. The curved line shows the path that the ISS follows as it orbits the Earth. The Earth is at the center of the diagram, and the ISS is shown as a small blue dot moving around it. \nI hope this helps to explain how the ISS's orbit is curved and how it uses propulsion to stay in orbit.

It does this by agitating the clothes in a tub of water and then spinning the tub to remove excess water. \nA dryer, on the other hand, is designed to remove moisture from clothes after they have been washed. It does this by blowing hot air over the clothes as they tumble in a drum. The heat from the air helps to evaporate the moisture from the clothes, and the tumbling action helps to fluff them up and remove wrinkles. \nOne reason that washers and dryers are separate machines is because they require different types of energy to operate. Washing machines typically use electricity to power the agitator and spin the tub, while dryers use electricity or natural gas to generate heat. \nAnother reason is that washing and drying clothes can be time-consuming processes, and having two separate machines allows people to do them at different times or even in different locations. For example, you might wash your clothes at home and then take them to a laundromat to dry them. \nOverall, having separate washers and dryers allows people to more efficiently clean and dry their clothes, and also gives them more flexibility in how they do these tasks.",

      "When we feel endangered or threatened, our natural instinct is to seek safety and protection. One way that people try to find safety is by hiding under the covers or in a small, enclosed space. This behavior is called \"seeking shelter\" and it is a way for our bodies to protect ourselves from harm. \nImagine that you are in a dark room and you hear a loud noise. Your body might automatically respond by trying to find a place to hide, like under the covers or behind a chair. This is because our brains are programmed to protect us from danger, and hiding can help us feel safer because it gives us a sense of being hidden or concealed from the thing that is threatening us. \nHiding under the covers can also be a comforting and familiar activity, especially for children. It can help us feel safe and secure, like we are back in the womb or being protected by our parents. \nSo, in short, people hide under the covers when they feel endangered because it is a natural instinct to seek safety and protection, and because it can also be a comforting and familiar activity.",

One reason for this is that books are often more complex than other forms of media, and it can be difficult to assign a simple rating that accurately reflects the content of a book. Additionally, books are often read by people of all ages, and a rating system that is appropriate for one age group might not be appropriate for another. \nOverall, the lack of a rating system for books is due to the fact that books are typically considered to be for a more general audience and are not necessarily targeted at specific age groups like other forms of media.",

      "Vanilla is a type of flavoring that is made from the seed pods of a tropical climbing orchid plant called Vanilla planifolia. These seed pods are green when they are picked from the plant, but they turn black when they are dried and cured. \nThe vanilla flavoring that we use in cooking and baking is made by extracting the flavor from the cured, black seed pods. The extract is a dark brown, almost black, color. However, when we use vanilla extract in our recipes, it is usually only a small amount, and it gets mixed in with other ingredients, so it doesn't have a noticeable effect on the overall color of the finished dish. \nVanilla is often associated with white and yellow because those are the colors of many of the foods and drinks that vanilla is used in, such as vanilla ice cream, vanilla cake, and vanilla frosting. These foods are white or yellow in color, and the vanilla flavoring helps to enhance their flavor, but it doesn't change their color. \nI hope this helps to explain why vanilla is often associated with white and yellow, even though the source of the flavor, the vanilla seed pods, are black.

To this day the debate goes on as to whether \u00e2\u0080\u009c noir \u00e2\u0080\u009d is a film genre defined by its content , or a style of storytelling or identified by its visual attributes .",

During its heyday in the 1940s and 1950s , movies were often shallow and formulaic , with a dashing , morally certain hero who always did the right thing saving the fair damsel in distress from the clutches of the mustache twirling villain .

These include: \n1. A dark, moody atmosphere: Film noir is known for its atmospheric, shadowy style, which is often created through the use of low-key lighting and cinematography. \n2. A focus on crime and moral ambiguity: Many film noir stories revolve around crime and the seedy underbelly of society, and often involve characters who are struggling with moral dilemmas or making difficult choices. \n3. Complex, flawed characters: Film noir characters are often complex and flawed, and may be struggling with their own inner demons or moral dilemmas. \n4. A femme fatale: A femme fatale is a type of female character who is seductive and manipulative, and often plays a key role in the plot of a film noir. \n5. A city setting: Many film noir stories take place in urban settings, such as Los Angeles or New York City, and often involve a sense of danger or seediness associated with these locations. \nKey themes in film noir include crime, moral ambiguity, and the corrupting influence of power and money.

      "A psychopath and a sociopath are two different terms that are often used to describe someone who behaves in a harmful or aggressive way towards others. However, these terms are not used in the same way by professionals in the field of psychology. \nA psychopath is someone who is characterized by a lack of empathy and remorse, as well as a tendency towards manipulation and a lack of concern for the well-being of others. Psychopaths may engage in criminal or unethical behavior, and they may be prone to violence. \nA sociopath is someone who exhibits similar behaviors, but the term is not used as frequently in the field of psychology. Instead, a person who exhibits these types of behaviors might be diagnosed with a personality disorder, such as antisocial personality disorder. \nHere are a couple of examples to help illustrate the difference between a psychopath and a sociopath: \nA psychopath might be someone who manipulates and lies to others in order to get what they want, without caring about the consequences of their actions on others. For example, a psychopath might lie to a friend in order to borrow money, and then never pay the friend back, without feeling any guilt or remorse.\nA sociopath might be someone who exhibits aggressive or violent behavior towards others, without feeling remorse or empathy for the harm they have caused. For example, a sociopath might get into a physical fight with someone over a minor disagreement, and not feel any remorse for the harm they have caused. \nIt's important to note that these terms are not used in a diagnostic sense by professionals in the field of psychology, and they should not be used to label or diagnose someone. If you are concerned about someone's behavior and the impact it is having on others, it is important to seek help from a mental health professional.",

    ],
    "generated_answer": [
      "Boxers train not to be knocked out by doing a variety of things: \n1. Physical training: Boxers work on building strength and endurance in their muscles through weight training, cardio exercises, and sparring (practicing fighting with another boxer). This helps them physically handle the impact of punches and stay on their feet longer during a fight. \n2. Mental training: Boxers also work on their mental toughness by training themselves to stay focused and calm under pressure. They practice techniques like visualization and deep breathing to stay composed and clear-headed, even when they're in the middle of a tough fight. \n3. Techniques to avoid getting hit: Boxers also work on techniques to avoid getting hit, such as dodging, weaving, and footwork. By learning how to move their body effectively and stay out of their opponent's range, they can reduce their chances of getting hit and being knocked out. \n4. Knowing how to take a punch: Finally, boxers learn how to take a punch and minimize the damage it causes. They practice techniques like rolling with the punch and tucking their chin to help absorb the impact and reduce the chances of being knocked out. \nOverall, being a successful boxer requires a combination of physical, mental, and technical skills. By working on all of these areas, boxers can improve their chances of not getting knocked out and having a successful fight.",

These laws are in place to protect the intellectual property rights of the creators and owners of this material, and to ensure that they are compensated for the use of their work. \nThe fines for piracy are often high because the unauthorized use of copyrighted material can cause significant financial harm to the creators and owners.

This can result in lost sales and revenue for the owner. \nIn addition to the financial harm that piracy causes, it can also have negative effects on the overall economy. When pirated material is widely available, it can be difficult for creators and owners to earn a living from their work, which can discourage innovation and creativity. \nOverall, the fines for piracy are intended to deter people from engaging in this illegal activity, and to compensate the creators and owners for the harm that has been caused.",

    "generated_answer": [
      "Different types of alcohol can affect your body differently because they contain different amounts of certain chemicals that can cause different reactions in your body. Alcohol is a depressant, which means it can slow down your brain and body functions. It's also a diuretic, which means it can cause you to lose more fluids from your body through urine, leading to dehydration. \nWhen you drink alcohol, your liver has to work to break it down and remove it from your body. Different types of alcohol are broken down at different rates, and this can affect how quickly you feel the effects of alcohol and how long it takes for your body to process it. For example, vodka is a clear liquor that is typically made from grains or potatoes, and it is generally considered to have a relatively neutral taste. It is also relatively high in alcohol content, with most vodka being around 40% alcohol by volume. This means that it can affect your body more quickly and intensely than other types of alcohol. \nOn the other hand, bourbon is a type of whiskey that is made from corn and aged in oak barrels. It typically has a strong, distinct flavor and is usually around 40% alcohol by volume. While bourbon can still affect your body in similar ways to vodka, the specific chemicals and ingredients in bourbon can cause different reactions in your body and may be more likely to lead to a hangover. \nIn general, the more alcohol you drink, the more likely you are to feel the effects of alcohol and to experience a hangover. However, different types of alcohol can affect your body differently, and certain types of alcohol may be more likely to cause a hangover than others. It's also important to note that individual differences in how people respond to alcohol can also play a role in whether or not you experience a hangover.",

      "Ecstasy, also known as MDMA or Molly, is a psychoactive drug that is often used recreationally for its stimulant and hallucinogenic effects. It is usually found in the form of a pill or capsule, but it can also be found in a powder or crystal form. \nEcstasy is not manufactured by the pharmaceutical industry because it is illegal in many countries, including the United States. Instead, it is produced and distributed by illegal drug manufacturers and traffickers. These individuals often operate in secret and use underground networks to distribute the drug. \nEcstasy can be transported and sold in many different ways. It might be smuggled across borders in small amounts and then sold to dealers, who in turn sell it to users. It can also be made and sold locally, in small laboratories or other hidden locations. \nRegardless of how it is produced or distributed, it is important to remember that using ecstasy is illegal and can be dangerous. It can cause serious side effects, including increased heart rate and blood pressure, dehydration, and even death. It is important to stay safe and avoid using illegal drugs.",

      "Much higher quality sensors and optics . In order to fit a small camera on the back of your phone , there 's a lot of compromises that need to be made so that it will fit in that limited space . That will affect the sharpness , clarity , and detail of the image , and when you 're getting paid for top quality shots , a camera phone just does n't cut it .",
      "It depends what you mean when you are talking about the \" camera \" . For many setups where mobility is n't as important the lens can be as big if not bigger than the camera body so that it can have a larger range of focal distance while maintaining the ability to shoot in low light . For a lot of more mobile camera setups fixed focal length lenses called primes or shorter zoom lenses are used reducing the apparent size of the \" camera \" . I 'm on mobile right now so I ca n't link but if you look up images of the \" red epic \" you 'll see a relatively small body ( about a 7 \" cube ) but it can really be built out to a monster of a camera . Then on the back end larger cameras will have large batteries attached as well as external recorders to record 4k resolution footage or Prores files to be used as dailies or proxies . This can add another 6 or so inches depending on battery profile and build . Finally there is just the camera body itself . This certainly varies when it comes to camera brands and models but generally what you are getting in those larger camera bodies that you are n't getting in a DSLR or a consumer camcorder is processing power . These days cameras are computers , and when it comes to capturing and recording the image that is hitting the sensor it 's all done using algorithms compress the footage to a useable size but still keeping the information needed to give you the most malleable product in post . To do this you need a robust processing system .

      "Television and media cameras are often large because they need to have a lot of different parts and components inside of them in order to function properly. These parts include things like lenses, sensors, processors, and other electronic components that are used to capture and process images and video. \nOne reason that cameras are often larger is because they need to have a lot of space inside of them to hold all of these different components. Additionally, larger cameras may have more advanced features or be able to capture higher quality images and video, which may require more space and more complex components. \nAnother reason that cameras are often larger is because they are designed to be used in a variety of different settings and environments. Larger cameras may be more durable and able to withstand more wear and tear, making them more suitable for use in challenging conditions such as extreme temperatures or rough terrain. \nFinally, larger cameras may also be more comfortable and easier to use for professional photographers and videographers, as they often have more buttons, controls, and features that allow for greater flexibility and customization when capturing images and video.",

      "What do you mean in the context of the government ? Broadly , the government raised how much students were allowed to borrow . Because students were allowed to borrow more money , they could give schools more in tuition . Because students could give more to schools in tuition , schools raised tuition .",
      "Student loans are a speculative investment that no rational lender would ever undertake without collateral and co - signers . In other words , your parents should have to mortgage their house to afford your college tuition . The government has decided that it wants more college graduates than there are people who can afford to attend , or who could borrow the money to attend . To close that gap , the government engages in lending to people who otherwise would never be able to qualify for those loans . In return the government is gambling that in fact those people will manage to pay off that debt . They are gambling that the value of the education received will enable those borrowers to increase their lifetime earnings by enough to make the necessary repayments . Because there 's so little scrutiny about how much is borrowed and for what purpose , the college system has been able to raise tuitions with the knowledge that the government will continue to make loans available to pay for the tuition . So the risk the government has to take on each individual student has increased over time . Today things appear to be approaching an equilibrium where the difference in lifetime earnings and the cost of the debt + interest is approaching zero . When we pass that threshold , and the cost of the debt + interest becomes demonstrably more than the increase in lifetime earnings , there will be a revolution .

These loans are typically provided by the government, but can also be offered by banks and other private lenders. \nWhen a student takes out a student loan, they are borrowing money from the lender to pay for their tuition and other education-related expenses. The student is then responsible for repaying the loan, with interest, after they graduate or leave school. \nThe amount of student loan funding available can impact the cost of tuition at a college or university. If there is a lot of funding available, schools may be able to charge lower tuition fees because they know that students will be able to borrow money to pay for their education.

    "human_answer": [
      "It 's complicated because the US Senate has a lot of somewhat quirky procedural rules that let Senators manipulate the system if they understand them well enough ( or fall into traps ) . In this particular case , there 's a combination of two issues here : ( 1 ) the federal budget , and ( 2 ) Obama 's executive nominations . On ( 1 ) , the Senate had to approve a funding bill by Saturday night , otherwise the government would run out of money and have to shut down again . So the leader of the Senate Democrats , Harry Reid , and the leader of the Senate Republicans , Mitch McConnell , made a deal to vote on Friday to pass funding for enough stuff to tide the government over until next Wednesday . Then everyone would go home for the weekend , and come back on Monday and finish passing the \" full \" funding bill . HOWEVER , under Senate rules , you have to wait a certain number of hours before voting on a bill , unless EVERYONE agrees to waive the rule . Since the Friday tide - us - over bill was a new thing , Reid and McConnell needed everyone on board so that they could pass it and go home . That 's where Cruz got involved . He basically said , \" Reid , McConnell , you agreed that on Monday we can pass this symbolic thing saying Obama 's an unconstitutional tyrant Kenyan Muslim socialist , or whatever , but that 's not good enough - we have to do it NOW . \" So he and Mike Lee refused to go along with waiving the time requirement . So that meant that everyone had to stick around until late in the night Friday / early Saturday morning to finish the budget thing . And that 's where item ( 2 ) comes into it . That extra time that all the Senators were sitting around gave Harry Reid the chance to keep the ball rolling on Obama 's nominations that have been stalled . Because he was able to move 24 of the nominees to the next procedural step , that means the can get voted on earlier next week . If they HADN'T moved that step forward on Friday night / Saturday morning , they would have had to do it on Monday , which means that the next step would have come at the end of next week , instead of the beginning / middle . And if they came at the end of next week , there 's a much better chance that a lot of Senators would be gone home for Christmas , and when they come back next year the Republicans will be in charge and they probably wo n't get passed . So basically , Ted Cruz pitching a meaningless hissy fit made it a lot more likely that a bunch of Obama nominees will get confirmed . Bravo , Ted .",
      "Not quite sure what the nominations were for , but they were supposed to vote on the Cromnibus spending bill on Monday . Cruz pushed to have the vote take place on Sunday , instead . The bill passed with bipartisan support . Cruz also raised a vote to block Obama 's executive orders on immigration . His plan , according to the article , was to have this vote on Sunday because he figured many democrats would be home with their families during the weekend , thereby leaving mostly congressmen who opposed the orders . However , the vote failed , and instead 20 of Obama 's nominations ( concerning the immigration reform ? ) were approved . This was the opposite of what Cruz wanted . The article then speculates that had Cruz waited until Monday , more democrats would have been home with their families and not able to vote , meaning the vote against the executive order would have succeeded . But remember , that 's from URL_0 , which is a very bias source of information . They might be writing the article to make Cruz look worse than normal ( as if he does n't do a good enough job of that himself )",
      "It 's important to note that none of the nominations were actually approved on Saturday . The votes allowed Sen. Reid to file a cloture motion on each nomination .

      "Fiber optics is a technology that uses thin strands of glass or plastic called optical fibers to transmit information, such as data or voice, over long distances. These fibers are extremely thin, about the diameter of a human hair, and are made of a special type of glass or plastic that is very good at transmitting light. \nLight travels through the fiber optic cables by bouncing off the walls of the fibers. This happens because the walls of the fibers are very smooth and the light reflects off them in a way that keeps it moving forward. The light reflects off the walls so many times that it travels a very long distance without losing much energy or intensity. \nOne reason that light can enter the fiber optic cable but not exit is because the walls of the fiber are made of a material that is very good at reflecting light. This means that when the light hits the walls, it bounces off them and continues traveling through the fiber. However, the walls of the fiber are also very smooth, which makes it difficult for the light to escape. This is why the light stays inside the fiber and is able to travel such a long distance without losing much intensity. \nThere are many practical applications of fiber optic technology. For example, it is often used to transmit data over long distances, such as in the internet. It is also used in telecommunications, cable television, and medical equipment. In these and other applications, fiber optics allows for fast, reliable, and secure communication.",

A lens: A wide-angle lens with a focal length of 18-35mm is generally best for capturing the Milky Way. \n3. A tripod: A tripod is essential for keeping your camera steady while taking long exposures. \n4.

This can create a pyramid-like structure, with the people at the top of the pyramid earning money from the sales of the people below them. \nHowever, MLM is not necessarily the same thing as a pyramid scheme. A pyramid scheme is a form of investment where each person involved recruits others to join. Money made by the new members funnels up to the higher members. No real product or service is being sold. It's simply a way for the people at the top of the pyramid to make money from the investments of those below them. \nMLM is legal as long as the company selling the products or services is legitimate and is selling real products or services. It's important to do your research and make sure that the company you're considering joining is a legitimate business and not just a pyramid scheme. If you have concerns about a particular MLM, you can check with your local consumer protection agency or the Better Business Bureau to see if there have been any complaints filed against the company.",

    "question": "What is mass ? I know that weight is the force that comes from gravity acting on mass , but what is mass all by itself ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Mass is a physical property of an object that determines it 's ability to resist acceleration . The more massive it is , the harder it is to start moving , stop moving or change its direction . Even without gravity you need a greater force to accelerate an object with a higher mass than one with a lower mass . Mass is basically determined by how much matter is in the object , ( how big and how dense it is ) though at speeds approaching light speed the mass of an object increases despite the amount of matter remaining the same . Mass , Inertia and Momentum are probably all words you 've heard of but they basically mean the same thing , their ability to resist acceleration . We just call it inertia when it 's stationary and momentum when it 's moving .",

They may have also simply been attracted to wolves because they found them to be interesting or friendly. \nOver time, early humans may have started to breed wolves that were particularly good at performing certain tasks, or that had desirable traits such as being friendly or obedient.

      "The Big Bang theory is the most widely accepted scientific theory for the origin of the universe. It suggests that about 13.8 billion years ago, the universe began as a singularity, a point of infinite density and temperature. At this moment, all the matter and energy in the universe were concentrated in a single, infinitely small and hot point. \nThen, for reasons that are not yet fully understood, this singularity underwent a tremendous expansion, causing the universe to rapidly cool and expand. As it expanded, the universe cooled, allowing for the formation of particles and eventually atoms. These atoms eventually coalesced into stars, galaxies, and everything else we see in the universe today. \nBefore the Big Bang, it is not clear what happened or if time itself had a meaning. Some theories suggest that the Big Bang was not the beginning of the universe, but rather the result of a previous contraction or collapse of a previous universe. Others propose that the Big Bang was the beginning of our universe, but that there may be other universes with their own origins and histories. \nOverall, the Big Bang theory provides a framework for understanding the evolution of the universe, but there is still much that scientists do not understand about the early universe and what may have happened before the Big Bang.",

      "The things you need to keep in mind are : * the structure of the meat i.e. how its cells are arranged . * the living environment of the original create e.g. caught in the wild , or raised on a farm . * the types of parasites / pathogens that the creatures are likely to be exposed to . The structure of the meat is important because it determines how easily / deeply any pathogen ( e.g. salmonella , e.coli ) can penetrate into the meat . For example chicken meat is basically a sponge . This means things like salmonella can penetrate deeply into the meat , which means you must cook the meat thoroughly in order to ensure safety ( the risk is low , but high enough to warrant this precaution ) . Beef on the other hand ( whole cuts at least ) are practically bulletproof as far as meats go . This is why you can have beef tartare , or steaks with barely a sear . The risk is comparatively much lower overall , and even if there is any harmful bacteria , it is unable to penetrate deeply into the meat - allowing you to quickly sear the meat and leave the center raw without any problems . This is also why you can easily dry age beef with few problems Ground / mince beef is technically riskier , but compared to most other meats the risk is very low ( hence tartare is on the menu ) . Fish , pork , and all wild meats can contain parasites ( with varying degrees of risk ) , which means extra care must be taken before safe consumption . Bear is so risky it is never eaten raw , while venison can be cooked to a lower temperature if handled properly beforehand . Raw fish is fine because most commercial sold fish is frozen beforehand to kill off any parasites . The same is done with pork generally , but because pork meat is still more \" spongy \" like chicken rather than \" layered \" like beef - you still have to cook thoroughly to remove the risk of bacterial contamination . Pork however can be safely dry cured when raw , as long as you use salt , sodium nitrite ( to prevent botulism ) , and the right environmental conditions ( temp / humidity ) for the cure to take place safely . Hence why you have salamis and serrano / prosciutto crudo ham . Overall - the important thing to remember is that * there is a reason * these recommendations exist * . Even though generally the risk is exaggerated through public policy ( for good reason ) , the risk is still present - so healthy adults may risk it with relative safety - but pregnant women , young children , immuno - compromised people , and the elderly should never take the risk .

      "It's generally safe to eat meats that are still pink or red in the middle as long as they have been properly handled, cooked to the right temperature, and not contaminated with bacteria. This is because the bacteria that can cause food poisoning, such as salmonella and E. coli, are generally found on the surface of the meat. When meat is cooked, the heat kills the bacteria on the surface, so if the meat is cooked all the way through, it will be safe to eat. \nHowever, certain meats, such as chicken, turkey, and pork, can carry bacteria inside them, so it's important to cook them all the way through to kill any bacteria that might be present. This is especially important when cooking chicken and turkey, as these types of meat can carry a type of bacteria called campylobacter, which can cause serious illness if it is not cooked all the way through. \nIt's also important to handle raw meat safely to avoid contaminating other foods or surfaces in your kitchen. This means washing your hands and any utensils or cutting boards that come into contact with the raw meat before and after handling it. \nIn summary, it's generally safe to eat meats that are still pink or red in the middle as long as they have been properly handled and cooked to the right temperature, but it's important to cook chicken, turkey, and pork all the way through to kill any bacteria that might be present inside them.",

      "When you bite your nails and swallow them, they will pass through your digestive system just like any other food or drink that you consume. However, nails are not a source of nutrition, and they do not provide any benefits to your body. In fact, swallowing nails can be harmful to your health. \nYour digestive system is a series of organs that work together to break down the food you eat and absorb the nutrients your body needs. As the nails move through your digestive system, they can cause problems by scratching and irritating the lining of your digestive tract. This can lead to pain, discomfort, and even bleeding. \nEating a lot of fiber, on the other hand, is good for your digestive health. Fiber is a type of carbohydrate that your body can't digest. It passes through your digestive system largely unchanged and helps to add bulk to your stool, making it easier to pass. This can help to prevent constipation and keep your digestive system running smoothly. \nSo, while nails do pass through your digestive system just like any other food, they are not a healthy or beneficial thing to eat. It's important to take care of your nails and keep them trimmed to avoid the temptation to bite them.",

      "There are a few reasons why world-renowned chefs might not be able to figure out the secret recipes for fast food chain items like KFC's fried chicken. \nFirst, it's important to understand that fast food chains typically keep their recipes secret in order to protect their brand and maintain a unique selling point. This means that they don't share their recipes with anyone, including world-renowned chefs. \nSecond, even if a chef were able to get their hands on the recipe, it might be difficult for them to recreate the exact taste and texture of the food. This is because fast food chains often use special cooking methods and ingredients that are not widely available to the general public. \nFinally, it's worth noting that even if a chef were able to figure out the recipe and recreate the food, it would not necessarily be considered \"world-renowned\" cuisine. Fast food is generally considered to be lower quality and less sophisticated than gourmet cuisine, and so it might not be something that a world-renowned chef would want to be known for.",

      "In the United States, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rates movies based on their content, including the level of violence, sexual content, language, and other factors. An \"R\" rating means that the movie is intended for audiences aged 17 and over, and that children under 17 can only watch the movie if they are accompanied by a parent or guardian. \nThe reason for this is that R-rated movies may contain material that is not suitable for children, such as strong language, violence, or sexual themes. While children are not allowed to watch R-rated movies on their own, they are allowed to act in them because they are performing a job, and they are usually accompanied on set by a parent or guardian who can make sure that they are not exposed to inappropriate content. \nHowever, it is important to note that the rules for children acting in movies can vary depending on the country and the specific production.

    "question": "Why is there a flu \" season \" ? If the flu is caused by a virus , why is it such a seasonal threat ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "I think it has to do with the fact that during flu season it is generally colder outside , which cause people to be indoors more . If everyone is inside , it increases the chances of coming in contact with someone who has the flu . I think My virology teacher said something like that . Also new flu shots are needed each year because influenza undergoes antigenic variation , which is a type of mutation .",
      "The seasonal nature of the flu has not been established by research . The temperature is n't likely to have anything to do with it . Being colder does n't have a direct effect on the immune system , and nothing about warm weather will kill the flu virus . In fact there is similar seasonal fluctuation in tropical areas compared with temperate areas [ source ] ( URL_1 ) . Tropical flu epidemics have caused * controversy * over some of the hypotheses for why flu is seasonal including . * Dry air makes flu more transmissible * People are indoors and close together during flu season * Decreased vitamin D production during the winter weakens the immune system * Seasonal decrease in UV radiation may allow for survivability of the virus [ further reading ] ( URL_0 )",
      "Disregard temperature and disregard people huddling together inside for a moment . First off , remember that the flu virus changes every single year . Yes , some years you may hear it 's mainly \" A \" or \" B \" or \" H1N1 , \" but the specific little virus changes every year . It 's not just making circles around the globe . 2013 's flu viruses did their damages , and eventually enough people developed immunity or died that it 's now gone . Aaaaaaaaand 2014 's is here . We 'll revisit this . Influenza largely comes from people living in close proximity with the two animals that can make flu happen : ducks and pigs . This does n't mean that people need to go slaughtering thousands of ducks and pigs like they were doing in 2009/2010 with the swine flu epidemic . It really just takes one pig , maybe a few , to pass along the virus to one human , maybe a few . So , farmers are the most likely to get it first and then spread it along . Once a farmer \" goes into town \" or just comes into contact with someone else who will \" go into town , \" a carrier is established , and it can spread quickly from there . Factor in airplanes , cars , trains , and before you know it influenza has made its way around the planet . Now , flu \" seasons \" vary by where you are in the world . You are most likely in North America , which is why you 're asking the question right now as opposed to a few months ago ( which would have lead me to believe you 're in Asia ) . This is because the flu always begins in Asia . Why Asia ? A couple reasons . There are many parts of Asia where humans farm large numbers of ducks and pigs , which provide the breeding ground for new flu viruses . Remember : new flu virus every year . Just like iPhones . Perhaps a better reason for Asia always getting it first , however , is the fact that the population on that continent is so huge . If you were to take all the humans on Earth , throw them into a bag , and randomly draw one out , you would be far more likely to have chosen someone who lives in Asia . After that , the flu * used to * spread at a predictable rate to South Asia , the Middle East , and North America almost simultaneously . Then Europe . Last was South America . I say \" used to \" because with the increase in global travel and the strange popularity of NOT getting vaccinated , the flu spreads pretty quickly these years . While South America still gets it last , it 's getting it sooner than usual ( used to be around March / April , now it 's more February / March ) . The reason you hear so much about it in North America is because it coincides with the Common Cold 's season . ( This , of course , simply happens when it 's cold outside , so a lot of the planet gets it at the same time ) . North Americans need the distinction made to them so that they do not think that they simply have the common cold and end up dying . This is why some Americans have a hard time being convinced that the \" Flu shot \" did them any good . They think , \" I got the shot last year and still got sick ! \" But what they really got sick with was the common cold , which shares a handful of symptoms with Influenza . So summertime finally comes around and all the people who were exposed to Influenza either had protection in the form of a vaccine ( Woo Hoo ! ) , picked it up but were able to develop enough antibodies for immunity , or just died . :( Then the cycle begins anew . I 'm sorry if this was long - winded , but if anything , please get your fucking flu shot as soon as it 's available . Not even at your earliest convenience ; * make time * for it . I want to add at this point that although it 's one form of the virus that usually does the most damage , our planet 's doctor 's develop a quadrivalent vaccine each year to protect against the four most likely ( or known ) strains that year . So you could catch someone 's Type A flu in California and survive it , then vacation to Florida and get fucked by H1N1 shortly thereafter . GET VACCINATED ."

This can happen because the weather is colder and people are spending more time indoors, which makes it easier for the virus to spread. In addition, people's immune systems may be weaker during the winter months, which can make them more susceptible to getting the flu. \nIt's also possible that the flu virus itself is more active during certain times of the year.

    "human_answer": [
      "There are two types of abortions . Medical and surgical . Medical is quite simple and can only be done between 4 - 8 weeks safely . The doctor will give you one pill to swallow in office ( this effectively kills the fetus ) and then you take home another prescription of misoprostol . It can be taken bucally ( lined along your gums and allowed to dissolve over time ) or vaginally ( inserted with a finger or tampon but must stay laying down for 2 - 4 hours so they do not exit your vagina ) . This send the uterus into contractions like when you have your period . This will be much heavier than your normal period . You will pass huge blood clots . The next day , you will have to take those same 4 pills again to ensure that your uterus has pushed everything out . Followed by a checkup in two to three weeks to make sure you got everything out . You will still test positive on a pregnancy test for 1 - 5 weeks because they hormones take their time going back to normal . So it 's important to see a Dr for follow up . The next version is surgical which is a d & c. They will give you a medicine that is used to soften and open your cervix . They will also inject novacaine or lidocaine to minimize pain . The procedure lasts no more than 2 - 5 minutes . They enter your uterus and scrape the walls and suck it out with a vacuum like machine . It is done in one sitting and can be verified that day that the abortion is complete . They only do these on 8 - 15 weeks . Unless it 's medically required . There is typically more risk associated with this form because the scraping can cut into your uterus and cause problems further along in life . Sorry on mobile phone . Hope this is simple enough . Edit : I see some people bringing up the d & e. I was really just trying to stick to what the op asked . A simple explanation of abortions . And for me , abortions are optional meaning choice .

      "Abortion is a medical procedure that ends a pregnancy. There are different ways to have an abortion, and the method used can depend on how far along the pregnancy is and other factors. \nOne way to have an abortion is with medication. This can be done during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. The person seeking the abortion takes two different medications. The first one, called mifepristone, is taken at a doctor's office. This medication makes it so the pregnancy cannot continue. A few days later, the person takes a second medication called misoprostol at home. This medication causes the uterus to contract and empty, which ends the pregnancy. \nAnother way to have an abortion is with a procedure called aspiration or suction abortion. This can be done during the first 16 to 20 weeks of pregnancy. During the procedure, a healthcare provider uses special instruments to remove the pregnancy from the uterus. The provider may use local anesthesia to numb the area and prevent pain. \nThere are other types of procedures that can be used to end a pregnancy, but these are the most common. \nAfter an abortion, the pregnancy tissue (including the fetus) is usually removed from the body. In some cases, the tissue may be examined to make sure the abortion was successful and to check for any complications. \nIt's important to note that abortion is a safe and legal medical procedure. However, it's also a personal and often difficult decision that can involve a range of emotions.

    "human_answer": [
      "Contrary to what many people are saying guns in the Civil War were way , way more accurate than the guns your average solders was using 20 years before the civil war . The problem was that they were still using black powder . Because of the range and power of [ rifled muskets ] ( URL_1 ) meant that the first couple of volleys could be catastrophic for the guys on the receiving end but soon after that there was so much smoke on the battle field that it would be hard to even see the enemy until they were very close . That being said , [ Napoleonic tactics ] ( URL_0 ) where much more common in the beginning stages of the Civil War than they were towards the end . Early forms of trench warfare were widely used during the later parts of the war although attackers where not as vulnerable as they were during WWI .",
      "So , let 's say you are a commander in pre - rifle infantry combat . Your muskets are not very accurate , so you need to mass troops together for effective volleys against the enemy . Further , any officer might be in charge of over one hundred individuals . You do n't have radios , the only thing you have are flags and bugles . So to maintain control of your troops you had them march in big blocks of men . That way you could control them and gain maximum volley potential . When the Civil War hit gun technology outstripped tactics . It also outstripped communications technology . So really the only way to fight was to keep your men close to you in big blocks so you could maneuver them the only way you knew how . This of course led to massive causualties because the rifled guns were very accurate . This is why the Civil War was so deadly , the individual soldiers were trained to only march in big blocks , and the officers were only trained to command big blocks of troops . You even saw this into WW1 . When troops went \" over the top \" they marched in big lines of troops to ensure that their officers could retain control . This of course led to big lines of men being cut down by new machine gun technology . Once again gun technology outstripped tactics . It is only into WW2 that we see the modern idea of small unit tactics taking real hold . Now we had radios , now we had training that empowered lower raking enlisted to make their own decisions on the battlefield . To answer your question : The reason they marched like this is because there really was no other way , there was no way for commanders to give orders to individuals or small units , they could only effectively command large groups . This lack of communication technology had the huge side - effect of a lot , and I mean a lot , of Americans dying , but it was the only way that anyone knew to command , and really , it was the only way to command at all .",
      "The weapons of the time were not that accurate and took a while to reload , so the best way to deal damage was to mass a bunch of guys together and all fire at once .

      "The purpose of this type of tactic, called a \"volley,\" was to try to kill as many enemy soldiers as possible in a short amount of time. During the Civil War, soldiers would often line up in rows, with one row firing their weapons at the enemy while the other rows reloaded their guns. When the first row had finished firing, they would drop to the ground and the next row would stand up and fire. This allowed the soldiers to keep firing without having to pause to reload their guns. The goal was to overwhelm the enemy with a constant barrage of gunfire. \nIt was a very dangerous tactic because the soldiers were often very close to the enemy when they fired, and they were also exposed to enemy fire. Many soldiers were killed or injured during volleys. Despite the risks, both Union and Confederate soldiers used this tactic during the Civil War.",

      "Tattoos are typically done using a machine that punctures the skin repeatedly with a needle to inject ink into the dermis, which is the layer of skin just below the epidermis. While the process of getting a tattoo can be painful, many people choose to undergo the process without using anaesthetics because they do not want to numb the area being tattooed. \nThere are several reasons why people might choose not to use anaesthetics when getting a tattoo. One reason is that some people enjoy the experience of getting a tattoo and see it as a form of body modification or self-expression. They may feel a sense of pride or accomplishment in enduring the pain of the tattoo process. \nAnother reason is that local anaesthetics, which are medications that numb a specific area of the body, can be expensive and may not be covered by insurance. Some people may also be allergic to anaesthetics or may not want to risk the potential side effects of the medication. \nIn addition, some tattoo artists may not offer anaesthetics as an option because they believe that the pain of getting a tattoo is part of the process and may even enhance the tattoo's overall appearance. \nOverall, the decision to use anaesthetics when getting a tattoo is a personal one that depends on an individual's pain tolerance and preferences. If you are considering getting a tattoo and are concerned about the pain, you may want to discuss your options with your tattoo artist and a healthcare provider.",

      "The Higgs boson, sometimes called the \"God particle,\" is a particle that was discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a large scientific experiment that smashes particles together to study what happens. The Higgs boson was named after physicist Peter Higgs, who proposed its existence in 1964. \nThe Higgs boson is important because it helps explain why other particles have mass. In the standard model of particle physics, which is a theory that explains how the basic building blocks of matter behave, the Higgs boson is associated with a field that permeates all of space. When other particles pass through this field, they acquire mass. This is why the Higgs boson is sometimes called the \"God particle,\" because it is believed to be a fundamental part of how the universe works. \nNow, as for the doomsday part: the Higgs boson is not going to cause the end of the world. It is a very small and extremely short-lived particle that is only produced in high-energy experiments like the LHC. It does not pose any danger to the Earth or to any other planet. In fact, understanding the Higgs boson and how it works can help scientists learn more about the universe and how it was created, which can ultimately lead to new discoveries and technologies that can benefit humanity. So, there's no need to worry about the Higgs boson causing doomsday!",

    "question": "why are dentists their own separate \" thing \" and not like any other specialty doctor ? Why do I have separate dental insurance ? Why are dentists totally separate from regular doctors ? Please explain like I'm five.",
    "human_answer": [
      "Finally , my time to shine . Dentist here . Dentistry for the most part developed as a skilled trade . The field has resisted attempts to integrate into medicine throughout its history . Initially , dental training was spotty at best and it did n't take much for somebody to claim they were a dentist . For example , Paul Revere advertised his skills as a dentist in addition to his other trade as a silver smith . There were \" dentists \" in the 18th century that were self proclaimed but branched out into dentistry after receiving a medical education , but that was not the norm . In the US , beginning in the 1840 's , dentists began to lobby the state government ( in Alabama of all places ) to allow dentists to sit on the state medical board and license dentists to practice . This did n't really begin to be enforced with any regularity until the turn of the 20th century . Many dentists that I know do not think that the two professions should merge ( as in everyone goes to medical school and then make dentistry a residency program after getting your MD ) . The claim is that there 's so much specialized knowledge in Dentistry that it would be a waste of time to spend years on rotations through the other hospital wards when you could be studying advanced periodontics or removable or whatever else . My personal opinion is that many dentists resist the change because of a fear in the reworking of the payment structure into one more similar to the HMO model that dominates general medicine . Right now HMO practice is big in dentistry but there 's still plenty of PPO plans and cash paying patients that the compensation is good , and for the most part an insurance company is n't telling you how to practice . There 's also quite a bit of territorial feelings when it comes to dentistry . Dentists tend not to like it when they feel their \" turf \" is threatened . For examples of that , just see the whole dental therapist debate . Well this turned into a wall of text . So TL;DR : History , Ego , Fears of Rocking the boat , all work together to keep the two separate . EDIT : This Gold is a Christmas miracle ! I took a little nap and woke up to an exploded inbox , I 'm going to try and get to as many questions as possible , so bear with me .",
      "They do n't go to medical school . They go to dental school . Other medical doctors all go to medical school and branch out after they graduate . Dentists go to a completely separate school . Historically , dentistry was first done by barbers . I do n't know why . All they did was pull infected / painful teeth . They were not considered healers , just tradesmen . * See below . Decided to check my facts .",
      "I 'm a dentist . My wife is an ER physician . We went to school for 4 years for dental and med school , respectively . After this , I was able to practice dentistry but she needed another 3 years of residency ( some do 5 ) to practice as an ER doc . We both took anatomy in the same lab for a full year but most of our year focused intensely on head and neck with the rest of the body 's main vessels , nerves , muscles , etc . while hers was detailed on the whole body with less focus on the head and neck than ourselves . Our paths diverge from that course on . As dentists we learn all general diseases , treatments , medicine and pathology in various courses . We can converse in them and understand them and understand how they affect the mouth and the interconnection between them all . We prescribe medications , administer drugs ( sedatives , nitrous , antibiotics , narcotics , etc . ) and must be responsible for their effects and interactions with other diseases , illnesses , and drugs . As dentists we have rigourous training in a multitude of areas : root canals , fillings , crowns , bridges , surgery , anesthesia , implants , pathology or mouth diseases , cancer , tumours , cysts , cosmetics , dentures , etc . This requires labourious hours working on plastic teeth , extracted , teeth , humans , and lots of textbooks . Because of all these disciplines , we jump into them right from year one with medicine learned in less detailed treatment , assessment , and diagnosis on the side - but we are responsible for what we do to our patients with various medical conditions or ailments . Physicians require residency to hone their area of expertise since their general medical degree just covered the basics of ALL medicine from delivering babies , to surgery , to diagnosing and treating all ailments of the body in much more rigourous detail than us dentists . Residency gets down to specialty and sub - specialty in these areas . What dentists do in practical physical work with our drill is the bulk of our 4 years beyond the textbooks . We can specialize in order to excel and focus on one given area of dentistry . EDIT : TL;DR Working with your hands requires a lot of practice . This is a huge component of dental school and we learn just enough medicine to not kill people with the drugs we prescribe or treatment we perform ."

    "human_answer": [
      "The data is on your hard drive and when you delete it , your computer allows the data to be overwritten .",
      "It is n't removed . The device only deletes the access information and now says the actual files are blank space , in reality they are still there . Until , you add new files that use that same space . With certain programs you can still access all those pics , videos , and docs you thought you deleted . If you keep lots of blank space on your device , chances are everything is still there . If you are constantly having to delete files to make room for more , those files may actually be gone .",
      "# # What is a File System ? Imagine your computer as a recipe book . It contains sections , such as \" * Cakes * \" , \" * Soups * \" or * \" Stews * \" which represent directories , and within each section are individual recipes , which represent the files on your computer . So you have a list of sections ( directories ) each of which contains a list of recipes ( files ) . The contents page contains a table which tells you on which page you can find each section and each individual recipe . This is like your file system , which is essentially a big table which tells the operating system on which part of the disk it can find each directory and file . With a recipe book , you can easily flick through the book to find things without looking through the contents , but on a computer that 's quite a bit harder because there are so many files : often hundreds of thousands or even millions on a single system . So on a computer , the file system is , for all intents and purposes , the only way to find files and directories . The act of * formatting * a disk with a specific file system is what actually creates a file system , which is like an empty contents table . It gives you a place where you can insert your recipes ( files ) and sections ( directories ) . ---- # # Deleting files What happens when you delete a file or a directory on a computer is that the entry in the file system is simply removed . It 's like just crossing out the entry for an individual recipe in the contents page of the recipe book . Notice that the actual recipe is still in the book , and you can still find it if you scan through the book looking for it . This is how undelete programs are able to recover deleted files ; they can search for the file on the disk and re - insert the entry back into the file system just like re - adding an entry for a recipe back into the contents table . So you 've removed the entry for a recipe from the contents , but what happens to the actual page on which your deleted recipe resides ? Well , the recipe is still on it , but it 's considered to be a free page now . This is where the analogy kind of breaks down , because obviously pages in a book ca n't just be written over , but parts of a disk can be . So a part of the disk containing the contents of a file which no longer has no entry in the file system is considered free to use . It 's just data that no longer belongs to anything . When you want to create a new file , that piece of the disk can be reused and new data can be written to it . --- # # Secure Deletion Secure delete programs will actually attempt to overwrite the data on the disk before removing the entry from the file system . In actual fact , this does n't always work because when you write new data to a file , it does n't necessarily reuse the same location on the disk , but that 's another topic entirely ."

      "When you delete a file from your computer, phone, or other device, the data is not immediately erased. Instead, the space that the file occupies on the storage device is marked as available for use, and the data is not actually removed until it is overwritten by new data. \nThink of it like this: Imagine you have a piece of paper with writing on it, and you want to delete the writing. You can't just make the writing disappear, but you can mark the paper as blank and ready to be used again. If you then write something new on the paper, the old writing will be covered up and effectively \"deleted.\" \nWhen you delete a file, the operating system marks the space on the storage device as available for reuse. The data is still there, but the system treats it as if it's not. If you save a new file, the system will probably use the space that the old file was occupying to store the new one. As a result, the old data will be overwritten and effectively erased it. \nThere are some cases where deleted data can be recovered, but it requires special software and is not something that most people can do on their own.

This will help you become more familiar with your own dream patterns and symbols, which can increase your chances of becoming aware that you are dreaming. \n2. Reality checks: During the day, periodically ask yourself if you are dreaming or awake. This will help train your brain to question its reality while you are dreaming, which can increase your chances of becoming lucid. \n3. Set an intention: Before you go to sleep, tell yourself that you want to have a lucid dream. This can help plant the seed in your subconscious mind and increase the likelihood of a lucid dream. \n4. Wake up and go back to sleep: If you wake up in the middle of the night, try to go back to sleep. This is a good time to have a lucid dream because your mind is in a state of transition between wakefulness and sleep. \nRemember, it can take some time and practice to successfully have a lucid dream.
